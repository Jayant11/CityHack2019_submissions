# AttendChecking

FACECORD is the web application that checks CityU students' attendance for lessons and examination.
It executes by using two cameras which are at the entrant and exit doors of the lecture theatres with
facial recognition function to detect students' faces and record their attendance.
Therefore, professors will have more precise students' attendance records and spare less time to check them.
