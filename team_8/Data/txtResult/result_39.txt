The ﬁnancial instruments traded on a regulated market are assessed at the closing price on the daybefore the calculation day of the net asset value, When these ﬁnancial instruments are traded onseveral regulated markets at the same time, the chosen closing price is the one of the regulatedmarket in which they are primarily traded,
However, in the absence of signiﬁcant transactions on a regulated market, the following financialinstruments are assessed using the following specific methods:
— Negotiable debt securities (“NDS”) having a residual life upon acquisition that is less than orequal to 3 months are assessed with a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of thedifference between the acquisition value and the redemption value, The management companynevertheless reserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case ofparticular sensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalentsecurity issues allocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
- NDS, of which the residual lifespan at acquisition is greater than 3 months but of which theresidual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is equal to or less than 3 months, are assessedby means of a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of the difference between the lastadopted current value and the reimbursement value, The management company neverthelessreserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case of particularsensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
- NDS, of which the residual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is greater than 3 months,are assessed at their current value. The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer.
— Firm future ﬁnancial instruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the clearing priceon the day before the calculation day Of the net asset value.
Conditional future ﬁnancial instruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the marketvalue on the day of the net asset value.
Over-the-counter firm or conditional future ﬁnancial instruments are assessed at the price given bythe ﬁnancial instrument‘s counterparty. They are presented in the off—balance sheet on the basis ofthe nominal value defined in the contract.
In the event of the holding of an EMTN, it will be valued 0n the basis of a market price given bythe financial instrument’s counterparty,
The management company independently carries out a verification of this assessment.- Deposits are assessed at their nominal value, plus any related interest that has accrued,
- Subscription warrants, cash certiﬁcates, promissory notes and mortgage notes are assessed attheir probable market value, under the management company‘s responsibility.
- Temporary securities acquisitions and sales are assessed at the market price.
— Units and equities in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities operatingunder French law are assessed at the last net asset value known on the calculation date of theMF’s net asset value.
Units and equities of UCITS operating under foreign law are assessed at the last unit net assetvalue known on the calculation date of the MF’s net asset value,
Financial instruments traded on a regulated market for which the price has not been determined orfor which the price has been corrected are assessed at their probable market value, under themanagement company’s responsibility

Reuters code: .dMIWOOOOOONUS
Bloomberg code: NDDUWI

Investment strategy:
1. Strategy employedThe MF will comply with the investment rules dictated by the European directive n0. 2009/65/EC dated 13 July 2009.
In pursuit of the greatest possible correlation with the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, the MF will reach itsmanagement objective using the indirect replication method which means that it will enter into one or more OTC swapcontracts enabling it to reach its investment objectives The objective of these swap contracts will be to exchange (i) thevalue of the MF’s assets, which will consist of balance sheet assets (excluding any securities received as guarantees),for (ii) the value of the securities that underlie the Benchmark Indicator.
The securities in the MF’s assets will notably be securities making up the Benchmark Indicator, as well as otherinternational equities, from all economic sectors, listed on all markets, including the small caps markets,
The securities basket held may be adjusted daily so that its value will be superior or equal to 100% of the Fund's netassets in most cases‘ Where necessary, the aim of this adjustment will be the neutralisation of the counterparty riskresulting from the future exchange contract described above,
Information relative to (i) the updated composition of the basket of the balance sheet assets held in the MF’s portfolioand (ii) the market value of the future exchange operation entered into by the MF are available on the page dedicated tothe MF on the Internet site www‘lyxoretfﬁom, The update frequency and/or the update date of the aforesaidinformation is also indicated on the same page of the aforesaid Internet sites
As part of the management of its exposure, the MF may be exposed up to 20% of its assets in equities from a singleissuing entity. This 20% limit can be increased to 35% for a single issuing entity when this proves to be justiﬁed byexceptional conditions within the market, notably when certain securities are heavily dominant and/or in the event ofhigh volatility of a financial instrument and of securities from an economic sector represented by the BenchmarkIndicator, in particular in the event of a public offering affecting one of the securities making up the BenchmarkIndicator or in the event of a signiﬁcant restriction of liquidity affecting one or more ﬁnancial instruments making upthe Benchmark Indicators
In the present case, the manager intends to primarily use the following assets:
2. Balance sheet assets {excluding integrated derivativest
The MF may hold, in compliance with the ratios contained in the regulation, international equities (from all economicsectors, listed on all markets), including within the small cap markets.
The aforementioned equities will be chosen on the basis of criteria:
- of eligibility, in particular:
0 Subordination to the main market indices or to the Benchmark Indicator,
0 Liquidity (minimal thresholds applied to mean daily volumes of transactions and to the equity market capitalisation),0 Rating of the country of the issuer’s head office (requirement of a minimal threshold in S&P rating or equivalent),
- of diversification, notably:
o Issuer (application of ratios applicable to the eligible assets of a CIU, as specified in Art. R214-21 0f the [French]Monetaiy and Financial Code),
0 Geographical area,0 Sector.
For more information on the abovementioned eligibility and diversification criteria, in particular the list of the eligibleindices, investors can visit the following Internet site: www.lyxoretf.com.
The investment in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS”) compliant with theDirective 2009/65/EC is limited to 10% of the assets of the MF. As part of these investments, the MF can subscribe tounits or equities of UCITS managed by the management company, or a company with which it is linked. The managerwill not invest in units or equities of AIF or other investment funds established on the basis of foreign laws.

When the MF receives securities as guarantee under the conditions and limits of this section’s paragraph 8 below, theywill also constitute balance sheet assets received in full ownership by the MF, given that they are received by the MP infull ownership.
As part of a future optimisation of the MF’s management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments withinthe limits of the regulations in order to achieve the management objectives
3. Off—balance sheet assets gderivative instruments[
The MF will use Index-linked swaps traded over the counter, thereby swapping the value of the MF’s assets (or of anyasset held by the MF, where appropriate) against the value of the Benchmark Indicator (in compliance with thedescription contained in this section's paragraph 1 above).
As part of a future optimisation of the MF management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments withinthe limits of the regulations, such as to achieve the management objective, for example including future financialinstruments other than index-linked swaps.
In compliance with its best execution policy, the management company considers that the Société Générale is thecounterparty that generally makes it possible to obtain the best possible result with these future ﬁnancial instruments.These future ﬁnancial instruments (including index-linked swaps) can therefore be traded with the Société Générale,without prior open competition involving several counterparties.
The counterparty 0f the aforesaid future ﬁnancial instruments (the “Counterparty”) will have no discretionary power
regarding the composition of the MF’s investment portfolio, nor regarding the underlying assets of the future ﬁnancialinstruments,
4. Securities with integrated derivativesNone
5. DepositsUp to a maximum of 20% of its net assets, the MF may have recourse to deposits with lending institutions belonging tothe same group as the depositary in order to optimise its cash management.
6. Cash borrowingUp to a maximum of 10% of its net assets, the MF may temporarily have recourse to borrowing.
7. Temnoragy securities acguisition and sale operationsNone. The manager will not have recourse to temporary securities acquisition and/or sale operation.
W
In all cases in which the MF is subject to a counterparty risk as a result of the deployed investment strategy, notably inthe event of the MF’s use of forward swap contracts traded over the counter, the MF can receive securities that areconsidered as guarantees in order to reduce the counterparty risk related to these operations. The portfolio of receivedguarantees can be adjusted each day in order for its value to be greater than or equal to the level of the counterparty riskborne by the MF in most cases, The objective of this adjustment will be to ensure that the level of counterparty riskborne by the MF is totally neutralized,
Any financial guarantee received by the MF will be provided to the MF in full ownership and listed in the MF’s accountopened in the books of its depositary. As such, the received ﬁnancial guarantees will be listed amongst the MF‘s assets.
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF within this framework must comply with the criteria deﬁned by theprevailing laws and regulations, notably in terms of liquidity, valuation, credit quality of the issuers, correlation, risksrelated to the management of securities, and applicability. The received guarantees must, in particular, comply with thefollowing conditions:
(a) Any received guarantee must be of high quality, very liquid and traded on a regulated market or in a multilateraltrading system with transparent pricing, in order to be sold quickly at a price close to the prior valuation;
(b) They must be valued at the mark-to-market price at least on a daily basis and assets showing strong price volatilitymust not be accepted as guarantee except in case of the application of a sufﬁciently cautious discount;
(c) They must be issued by an entity that is independent of the counterparty and must not be highly correlated with thecounterparty’s performances;
(d) They must be sufficiently diversified in terms of countries, markets and issuers, with a maximum exposure perissuer of 20% of the MF’s net asset value;
(e) The MF’s Management Company must be able to fully realise them at any time, without consultation with thecounterparty nor approval of the latter,
Notwithstanding the condition speciﬁed in (d) above, the Fund may receive a basket of financial guarantees with anexposure to a single issuer corresponding to more than 20% of its net asset value provided that:
Such received financial guarantees are issued by (i) a Member State, (ii) one or more of a Member State’s localauthorities, (iii) a country that is not a Member State (iv) a public international organization to which one or moreMember States belong; and
Such financial guarantees consists of at least six different issues of which none exceeds 30% of the MF’s assets

- Eguity risk
An equity price can vary upward or downward, and it notably reﬂects the changing risks related to the issuing company01' the economic situation of the corresponding market. The equity markets are more volatile than the rate markets, inwhich it is possible, over a given period and with equal macroeconomic conditions, to estimate the incomes,

- Liguidity risk mrimarx market!
Should the MF (or one of its counterparties for future ﬁnancial instrument (“FFI”)) adjust its exposure and the marketsrelated to this exposure are then limited, closed or subject to signiﬁcant purchase / sale price discrepancies, the valueand/or liquidity of the MF could be negatively affected Should low volumes of exchanges result in an inability to carryout transactions linked to the replication of the Benchmark Indicator, this can also have consequences on the processesrelated to the subscription, conversion or redemption of units.
- Liquidity risk on a place of listing
The MF’s share price can deviate from its indicative net asset value. The liquidity of the MF’s units or equities on aplace of listing can be affected by any suspension that could notably be due to:

ii) Suspension of the market(s) 0f the underlyings used by the Benchmark Indicator, and/or
iii) The impossibility for a given place of listing to obtain or calculate the MF’s indicative net asset value, and/oriv) A market maker’s Violation of the rules applicable to this marketplace, and/or
V) A failure of this marketplace's IT or electronic systems,
M&y—risk
The MF is exposed to the risk of bankruptcy, payment default or any other type of default of every counterparty withwhich it has entered into a contract or transaction, It is particularly exposed to the counterparty risk resulting from itsuse of FFI traded over-the-counter with Société Générale or with any other counterparty, In compliance with the UCITSregulations, the counterparty risk (whether this counterparty is the Société Générale or any other entity) cannot exceed10% of the total value of the MF's assets per counterparty.
In case of a Counterparty’s default, the contract relating to FFIs can be terminated early. The MF will then make everyeffort to achieve its management objective by signing, if relevant, another contract relating to FFIs with a third partycounterparty, under the market conditions prevailing at the time of the occurrence of this event.
The realisation of this risk can notably have impacts on the MF’s ability to achieve its management objective, inparticular the replication of the Benchmark Indicator.
When Société Générale is involved as a counterparty of the FFIs, conﬂicts of interest can arise between the MF’sManagement Company and the FFI’s counterparty. The Management Company manages these conﬂict of interest risksby setting up procedures intended to identify and limit them, and to ensure their equitable resolution, if relevant,
- Risk that the management objective may only be partially achieved
Nothing guarantees that the management objective will be achieved‘ Indeed, n0 asset or financial instrument will allowan automatic and continuous replication of the Benchmark Indicator, notably should one or more of the following risksarise:
- Risk related to the use of derivative instruments

In order to achieve its investment objective, the MF uses FFI traded over-the-counter, that can notably take the form ofswap contracts that will allow it to obtain the performance of the Benchmark Indicator. These FFIs can result in a seriesof risks on the level of the FFIs that notably include: counterparty risk, event affecting the hedging, event affecting theBenc1mark Indicator, risk related to the tax regime, risk related to the regulations, operational risk and liquidity risk.These risks can directly affect a FFI and can result in the adjustment or early termination of the FFI transaction, whichcoul affect the MF‘s net asset value.
— Ris relate to a change of the tax regime
Any change to the tax legislation in any of the countries in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing orlisted can affect the tax treatment of the investors. In this case, the MF’s manager assumes no liability relative toinvestors wit regard to the payments having to be made to any competent tax authority.
— Ris relate to a change of the tax regime affecting the underlying;
Any change of the tax legislation applicable to the MF’s underlyings can affect the MF's tax treatment, Consequently,in case of divergence between the anticipated tax treatment and the one actually applied to the MF (and/or to itscounterparty in the FFI), the MF’s net asset value may be affected.
- Ris relatec to regulations
In case of change of the regulations in any country in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing or listed,the processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units may be affected.
- Ris relatec to the regulations agplicable to the underlyings

In case of change of the regulations applicable to the MF’s underlyings, the MF’s net asset value can be affected, as canthe processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units.
- Ris relatec to events affecting the Benchmark Indicator
In case of events affecting the Benchmark Indicator, the manager may, under the conditions and limits of the applicablelegis ation, have to suspend the subscription and redemption of MF units. The calculation of the MF’s net asset valuecan also be a fected.


If the event persists, the MF’s manager will decide on measures having to be adopted, which can have an impact on theMF’s net asset value.
“Events affecting the Benchmark Indicator are understood to mean the following situations:
1) The Benchmark Indicator is considered to be incorrect or not reﬂective of the market’s actual evolution,ii) The Benchmark Indicator is definitively discontinued by the supplier of the index,
iii) The supplier of the index is incapable of providing the level or value of the said Benchmark Indicator,
iv) The supplier of the index makes a significant change to the formula or calculation method of the BenchmarkIndicator (other than a minor modiﬁcation such as the adjustment of the underlyings used with this BenchmarkIndicator or of the respective weightings between its various components), that cannot be effectively replicated by theMF at a reasonable cost,

V) One or more components of the Benchmark Indicator becomes non-liquid.
Vi) The Benchmark Indicator's components are impacted by transaction fees relative to the execution, delivery versuspayment or specific ﬁscal constraints, without these fees being reﬂected in the Benchmark Indicator’s performance.
- Securities transaction risk
Should the issuer of a security underlying the Benchmark Indicator undertake an unanticipated review of a securitiestransaction (“ST), that contradicts a prior and ofﬁcial announcement that had resulted in a valuation of the ST by theMF (and/or in a valuation of the ST by the MF’s counterparty in a future ﬁnancial instrument), the MF’s net asset Valuemay be affected, notably should the actual treatment of the ST by the MF differ from the ST’s treatment in themethodology used by the Benchmark Indicators
- Exchange risk linked to the Benchmark Indicator
The MP is exposed to the exchange risk insofar as the underlying securities making up the Benchmark Indicator may belisted in a currency other than the currency of the Benchmark Indicator or be derived from securities listed in a currencyother than the currency of the Benchmark Indicator. The ﬂuctuations of exchange rates could therefore negatively affectthe Benchmark Indicator followed by the MF.
- Exchange risk linked to the classes of units D-EUR (EUR/USD)
The abovementioned class of units is exposed to an exchange risk to the extent that it is listed in a currency other thanthat of the Benchmark Indicator. The net asset value of the abovementioned class of units can therefore decrease due toﬂuctuating exchange rates even though the value of the Benchmark Indicator has increased.
— Risk related to the exchange hedgi_ng speciﬁc to the Monthly Hedged D-EUR and Monthly Hedged D-USD unitclasses:

In order to hedge the exchange risk on the EUR (respectively US dollar) against the currency of each of the valuescomprising the index speciﬁc to the Monthly Hedged D-EUR (respectively Monthly Hedged D-USD) unit class, the MFuses a hedging strategy intended to reduce the impact of the evolution between the currency of each of the valuescomprising the Benchmark Indicator and the currency of the said unit class. This hedge nevertheless remains imperfectas a result of its monthly adjustment frequency and the employed instruments; the MF can therefore be subject todownward market movements that will impact to the unit’s net asset value, Moreover, the cost of implementing theexchange hedge will have a negative impact on the net asset value of the Monthly Hedged D-EUR and Monthly HedgedD-USD units,
- Legal riskThe mutual fund may bear a legal risk related to the conclusion of any Total Return Swap contract (TRS) as laid downin Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.

T‘te fund replicates the performance of the MSCI DAILY TR NET WORLD index, listed in US dollars (USD),representative of performance of large and mid-caps of developed markets,
T118 index has shown an evolution of 14.77% over the fiscal year. As the C-EUR, D-EUR, MONTHLY HEDGED D-EUR classes are not valued in the index currency, the evolution of its net asset value is subject to an exchange risk.Over the ﬁscal year, the EUR has decreased by 6.14% against the USD.
T‘llS gap between the annual performance of the UCITS and that of its Benchmark Index can be explained by the resultof the various parameters listed below:
