Tax transparency code
WoodSide participates in the Australian Board of Taxation'svoluntary Tax Transparency Code (TTC). To increase publicconfidence in the contributions and compliance of corporatetaxpayers, the TTC recommends public disclosure of taxinformation. Woodside has addressed the recommendeddisclosures in two parts. The Part A disclosures are addressedWithin this Taxes note; the Part B disclosures are addressed in ourSustainable Development Report.
Recognition and measurement
Current tax assets and liabilities are measured at the amountexpected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities.Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates thatare expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled orthe asset is realised. The tax rates and laws used to determine theamount are based on those that have been enacted or substantiallyenacted by the end of the reporting period. Income taxes relating toitems recognised directly in equity are recognised in equity.
Current taxes
Current tax expense is the expected tax payable on the taxableincome for the year and any adjustment to tax payable in respectof previous years,
Deferred taxes
Deferred tax expense is the movements in the temporarydifferences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability inthe statement of financial position and its tax base:
With the exception of those noted below, deterred tax liabilities
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences, Deferred
tax assets are recognised for deductible temporary differences.unused tax losses and tax credits only if it is probable that sufficientfuture taxable income will be available to utilise those temporarydifferences and losses.
Deferred tax is not recognised it the temporary difterence arisesfrom goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in abusmess combination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction thatattects neither accounting profit nor the taxable profit.
In relation to PRRT, the impact of future augmentation onexpenditure is included in the determination of future taxableproﬁts when assessing the extent to which a deferred tax asset canbe recognised in the statement of financial position.
Otfsetting deterred tax balances
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only it there is a legallyenforceable right to offset current tax assets and liabilities andwhen they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxationauthority on either the same taxable entity or different taxableentities that the Group intends to settle its current tax assets andliabilities on a net basis. Referto Notes ES) and E10 for detail onthe tax consolidated group:
Key estimates and judgements
(a) Income tax classification
Judgement IS required when determining whether a particular tax isan income tax or another type of tax. Accounting tor deterred tax 15applied to income taxes as described above, but is not applied to othertypes of taxes, e.g. North West Shelf royalties and excise. Such taxesare recognised ll'l the income statement on an appropriate basns: PRRTis considered, for accounting purposes, to be an income tax.
(b) Deferred tax asset recognition
Australian tax losses: A deterred tax asset of US$169 million
(2016: US$119 million) has been recognised from carry forward unusedtax losses and credits, The Group has determined that it IS probablethat sufficient future taxable income Will be availa ble to utilise thoselosses and credits.
Foreign tax losses‘ Deferred tax assets of US$403 million
(2016: US$407 million) relating to unused foreign tax losses whereit 13 not probable that the assets will be utilised based on currentplanned activities in those regions.
PRRT: Deferred tax assets on deductible temporary differences
have not been recognised on the basis that deductions from futureaug mentation of the deductible temporary difference will be sufficientto offset future taxable brotit. US$372 million (2016: US$592million) relates to the North WestSheIfProject,US$501miIIion<2016:US$425 million) relates to the quarantined exploration spend of thePluto Preject and US$680 million (2016: US$605 million) relates to theWheatstone Project. Future taxable profits were determined using thesame assumptions disclosed in Note 8.4 and a Iong—term bond rate of2.5% (2016: 2.2%) tor the purposes of augmentation:
Had an alternative approach been used to assess recovery of thedeferred tax assets, whereby future augmentation was not Included
in the assessment. the estimated deferred tax assets would be
recog nised, with a corresponding beneﬁt to Income tax expense. It wasdetermined that the approach adopted browdes the most meaningfulinformation on the implications of the PRRT regime, whilst ensuringcompliance with AASB 112 lncome Taxes,

Recognition and measurement
Expenditure on exploration and evaiuation is accounted for
in accordance with the area of interest method. The Group’sapplication of the accounting policy for the cost of exploring andof evaluating discoveries iS Cioseiy aligned to the US GAAP-basedsuccessful efforts method.
Areas of interest are based on a geographica1area.A1|exp1orationand evaluation expenditure, including genera1 permit activity,geological and geophySicai costs and new venture activity costs, isexpensed as incurred except for the following,
- where the expenditure relates to an exploration discovery that.at the reporting date, has not been recognised as an area ofinterest, because an assessment of the existence or otherwise ofeconomically recoverabie reserves is not yet compiete; or
- where the expenditure relates to a recognised area of interestand it is expected that the expenditure wili be recouped throughsuccessful eprOitation ofthe area of interest. or aiternatively,by its saie.
The costs of acqwring interests in new exbioration and evaiuation1icences are capitalised. The costs of driilihg expioration welisare initialiy capitalised pending the resuits of the we1|.Costs
Key estimates and judgements
(3) Area of interest
An area of interest (A01) is defined by the Group as an indivtdualgeographical area whereby the presence of hydrocarbons is consideredfavourable or proved to exist. The Group has established criteria
to recognise and maintain an A01. There is separate guidance forconventional and unconventional AOis.
(b) Impairment of exploration and evaluation assets
The recoverability of the carrying amount of the exploration andevaiuation assets is dependent on successful development andcommercial exbioitation, or alternativeiy. sale of the respective AOI.
Each potential or recognised A01 is revtewed haIf-yearly to determinewhether economic quantities of reserves have been found or whether
are expensed where the well does not result in the successfuldiscovery of economicaliy recoverable hydrocarbons and therecognition of an area of interest.
Subsequent to the recognition of an area otinterest.a|1furtherevaluation costs relating to that area of interest are capitaiised.
Upon approval for the commercial deve1opment of an area ofinterest, accumuiated expenditure for the area of interest istransferred to oil and gas properties)
In the statement of Cash ﬂows, those Cash flows associatedWith capitaiised exploration and evaiuation expenditure,inciuding unsuccessful weils, are ciassified as cash flows usedin investing activities,
Exploration commitments
The Group has exbioration expenditure obligations which arecontracted for, but not provided for in the finanCiai statements.These obligations may be varied from time to time and areexpected to be fuitilied in the normal course of operations

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS B. PRODUCTION AND GROWTH ASSETS

8.4 Impairment of oil and gas properties
Recognition and measurement
Impairment testing
The carrying amounts of oil and gas properties are assessed half-yearly to determine whether there is an indication of impairmentor impairment reversal for those assets which have previouslybeen impaired, Indicators of impairment and impairment reversaisinclude changes in future selling prices, future costs and reserves.When assessing potential indicators of impairment or reversais theGroup modeis scenarios and a range of bossnbie future commodityprices 15 considered, If any such indication exists. the assetsrecoverabie amount iS estimated.
Oii and gas properties are assessed for impairment indicators andimpairments on a cash generating unit (CGU) basis. CGUS aredetermined as a ﬂoating production, storage and offetake vesselfor an 011 asset and a LNG Plant for a gas asset.
Impairment calculations
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is determined as thehigher of its value in use and fair value less costs of disposal. Vaiuein use is determined by estimating future cash ﬂows after takinginto account the risks speCitic to the asset and discounting it to itspresent vaiue using an appropriate discount rate.
It the carrying amount ofan asset or CGU exceeds its recoverabteamount, the asset or CGU is written down and an impairment iossis recognised in the income statement.
For assets breViously impaired, it the recoverabie amount exceedsthe carrying amount, the impairment 1055 is reversed. The carryingamount of the asset or CGU iS increased to the revised estimateof its recoverabie amount, but oniy to the extent that the asset’scarrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that wouidhave been determined, net of depremation or amortisation. it noimpairment loss had been recognised.
Key estimates and judgements
Impairment and impairment reversal indicator modellingkey assumptions
In determining whether there is an indicator of impairment or impairmentreversai, in the absence of quoted market prices, estimates are maderegarding the present value of future cash ﬂows for each CGU. Theseestimates require signiﬁcant management judgement and are subject torisk and uncertainty, and hence changes in economic conditions can aisoaffect the assumptions used and the rates used to discount future cashfiow estimates. The present value of future cash ﬂows for each CGU wereestimated using the assumptions set out below:
- Infiation rate — an inﬂation rate of 2.0% has been applied (2016: 2.0%).
- Foreign exchange rates — rate of $0.78 AUD:USD (2016: $0.76) basedon management‘s assumptions of short and Iong-terrn views ofgiobal rates.
- Discount rate - a range of pre-tax discount rates have been appiiedbetween 9% and 11% (2016: 9% and 11%).
Recognised impairment and impairment reversal
The Group assessed each CGU to determine whether an indicatorof impairment or impairment reversal existed. No indicators ofimpairment or impairment reversal were identified in 2016 or 2017.
Inputs to impairment indicator modeiling

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS C. DEBT ANDCAPlTAL
for the year ended 31 December 2017
In this section
This section addresses cash, debt and capital position of the Group at the end of the reporting period including, where applicable. theaccounting policies applied and the key estimates and judgements made.

Key financial and capital risks in this section

Capital risk management
Capital management is undertaken to ensure that a secure, costeettective and fleXible supply of funds is available to meet the Group'soperating and capital expenditure requirements A stable capital base is maintained from which the Group can pursue its growthaspirations, whilst maintaining a ﬂeXible capital structure that allows access to a range of debt and equity markets to both draw upon and
repay Capital.
The DiVidend Reinvestment Plan (DRP) was approved by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting in 2003 for activation as required tofund future growth. The DRP has not been utilised since the fully underwritten 2015 ﬁnal diVidend.
A range of ﬁnancial metrics is monitored. including gearing and cash flow leverage, and Treasury policy breaches and exceptions
Liquidity risk management
LiqUidity risk arises from the financial liabilities of the Group and the Group‘s subsequent ability to meet its obligations to repay ﬁnancialliabilities as and when they fall due. The liquidity position of the Group is managed to ensure sufﬁcient liquid funds are available to meet itsfinancial commitments in a timely and costeettective manner‘
The Group’s liquidity position is continually reviewed including cash flow forecasts to determine the forecast liquidity position and maintainappropriate liquidity levels. At 31 December 2017, the Group has a total of US$2.942 million (2016: US$2679 million) of available undrawnfaCilities and cash at its disposal. The maturity proﬁle of interest-bearing liabilities is disclosed in Note C2, and trade and other payables aredisclosed in Note D13 Financing facilities available to the Group are disclosed in Note C.2.
Interest rate risk managementInterest rate risk is the risk that the Group's financial position will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
The Group’s exposure to the risk of changes in market interest rates relates primarily to financial instruments with floating interest ratesincluding longeterm debt obligations and Cash and shorteterm depOSits. The Group manages its interest rate risk by maintaining anappropriate mix offixed and floating rate debt. To manage the ratio of fixed rate debt to ﬂoating rate debt, the Group may enter intointerest rate swaps, The Group holds cross-currehcy interest rate swaps to hedge the foreign exchange risk (refer to Section A) andinterest rate risk of the CHF denominated medium term note.
At the reporting date, the Group was exposed to various benchmark interest rates that were not designated in cash flow hedges,US$84 million (2016: US$43 million) on cash and cash equivalents. US$1020 million (2016: US$153} million) on interest-bearihg liabilities(excluding transaction costs) and US$11 million (2016: US$53 million) on crossicurrency interest rate swaps.
A reasonably pOSSible change in the USD London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR) (+l.O%/-l.0% (2016: +1,0%/-l,0%)), with all variables heldconstant, would not have a material impact on the Group’s eqwty or the income statement in the current period.

We have maintained high shareholder distributions, paying atuII-year dividend of 98 cents per share, up from 83 cents last year.
Your company has continued to demonstrate discipline onspending and balance sheet management while looking foropportunities to grow.
We have identified one such opportunity in the acquisition
of an increased interest in the Scarborough resource and
its costeeffective development through an existing facility.
In conjunction with this, we have announced a A$25 billionrights issue, which maintains our prudent financial position andensures we are welleplaced to develop not only Scarboroughbut also other planned projects that will help meet rising globaldemand for LNG and deliver signiﬁcant returns to shareholders.
Predicting oil prices With any reliability is impossible, butWoodside has shown over the years that a low cost producercan survive and indeed prosper in any conditions Against thebackdrop of oil price volatility and. at times in the past decade,global financial stress, your company was able to maintainprofits and pay dividends, We were also in a position to considernew opportunities as they arose and grow our por folio whenthis presented value for shareholders.
In 2017, oil prices stabilised and then firmed, supporting higheraverage realised prices. LNG spot prices tluctuatec, increasingsignificantly in the second half of the year. primarily due to
increased ASian demand and seasonal variations.
Investment in new LNG globally has not kept up with growth
in demand: in 20l7, global LNG demand increased 0y around30 mtpa but only one new LNG project, for 3.4 mtpa. wasapproved. it is clear that new projects will be needed. Againstthis backdrop your company is ready to deliver and we haveoutlined to investors our plans for future projects t at are timedto take advantage of this opportunity.
We are progressing towards a sensible outcome for thedevelopment of the plentiful gas resources off Wes ern Australia.

A further sign ofyour company’s evolution came in 2017, as wetarewelled Shell from our register of shareholders, reinforcingWoodside's independence. We have appreciated the supportorowded by Shell over the years, as a long»term shareholderand Jaint Venture participant, participant in our Board and, inearlier days, through the secondment of staff.
Amid increasing global competition for capital, it is vitalhat governments are mindful that their decisions shapeousiness conditions,
We have had to confront a number of concerning issues inAustralia in this regard over the last year. The first has been therefusal of the Federal Opposition and minor parties to supporthe Commonwealth Government’s proposal to reduce thecorporate tax rate for all companies. It lS obvious to anyoneinvolved in corporate life that it Australia has a company
ax rate which is out of l<i|ter with that in other countries,investment dollars and jobs Will leave our shores.
Additionally, over the course of 2017, the Australian Governmentgave consideration to imposing increased taxes on our industry,t is encouraging that on this matter the Government seems
0 have taken a rational approach thus tar. Any changes,particularly retrospective changes, which ieopardised futureexploration and development would be very shortesighted.

hirdly, we have seen changes to immigration rules, particularlywith respect to 457 visas, which have made it harder to bringexperienced professionals to Australia. At a time when skillshortages are occurring in many ﬁelds, this has been verycounter-productive.
:inally, we are hearing promises by the Federal Oppositionto increase regulation and costs in the employment market, moves which would run directly counter to the need forincreased ﬂexibility in this disruptive world.
n reflecting on Woodside’s success, it is clear to me that it hasseen achieved through a combination of disCipline and vision.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS D.OTi—iER ASSETS AND LIABlLiTiES
for the year ended 31 December 2017
D.4 Provisions (cont)
Recognition and measurement
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a presentobiigation (legai or constructive) as a resuit of a past event. itiS probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economicbenefits will be required to settle the obligation and a reliabieestimate can be made of the amount of the obligations
Restoration of operating locations
Provision is made for the obiigation to restore operating iocationsi
The provision is first recognised in the period in which theobiigation arises. The nature of restoration activities inciudes theremoval of facilities, abandonment of weils and restoration ofaffected areas.
Restoration provisions are updated anhuaiiy, with thecorresponding movement recognised against the reiatedexploration and evaiuation assets or oil and gas properties.
Over time, the liabiiity is increased for the change in the presentvalue based on a pretax discount rate appropriate to the risksinherent in the liabiiity. The unwmding of the discount is recordedas an accretion charge within finance costs, The carrying amountcapitalised in oil and gas properties is depreciated over the usefuliite otthe related asset (refer to Note 8.3).
Costs incurred that relate to an existing condition caused by pastoperations and do not have a future economic beneﬁtare expensedi
Key estimates and judgements
(a) Restoration obligations
The Group estimates the future removal costs of offshore OII and gasplatforms, production facilities, weils and pipelines at different stagesof the development and construction of assets or faculties. in mostinstances. removai of assets occurs many years into the future,
This requires judgemental assumptions regarding removal date, futureenwronmental iegisiation, the extent of recla mation activities required,the engineering methodoiogy for estimating cost, future removaltechnoiogies in determining the removal cost, and liability speCIficdiscount rates to determine the present value of these cash ﬂows.
The proportion of the non-current balance not expected to be settledwithin 15 years is 63% (2016: 61%).
D5 Segment assets and liabilities
Employee benefits
Provision is made for employee benefits accumuiated as a resuit0t empioyees rendering services up to the end otthe reportingperiod. These benefits include wages, salaries, annuai ieave andlong service ieave.
Liabilities in respect of employees services rendered that are notexpected to be wholiy settled within one year after the end ofthe period in which the employees render the reiated services arerecognised as longeterm employee benefits.
These iiabilities are measured at the present value of theestimated future cash outﬂow to be made to the employees usingthe proiected unit credit method. Liabiiities expected to be wholiysettled Within one year after the end of the period in which theemployees render the reiated services are classified as shortetermbenefits and are measured at the amount due to be paid.
(b) Long service leave
Long service ieave is measured at the present value of benefitsaccumulated up to the end of the reporting period. The liability isdiscounted usmg an appropriate discount rate. Management requiresJudgement to determine key assumptions used in the calculationincluding future increases in salaries and wages, future on-cost rates andfuture settiement dates of empioyees' departures.
(c) Legal case outcomes
Provisions for iegal cases are measured at the present value of theamount expected to settle the claim. Management is required to useJudgement when assessing the iikely outcome of legal cases, estimatingthe risked amount and whether a prOVision 0r contingent liability shouldbe recognised.

1. Impairment of non-current assets
Australian Accounting Standards require the Group to assess throughout thereporting period whether there is any indication that an asset may beimpaired. ii any indication exists, the Group must estimate the recoverableamount at the asset At year end. the Group has concluded, based on thisassessment, that there were no indicators oi impairment or reversal atprevious impairments for any oi its Cash Generating Units (CGUS), As aresult no impairment or reversal ofimpairment was recognised during theyear
The assessment of indicators of impairment and reversal of impairment iscomplex and highlyjudgmental, and includes modelling a range ofassumptions and estimates that are attected by expected futurepertormance and market conditions, Accordingly. this matter was consideredto be a key audit matter.
Key assumptions, judgements and estimates used in the Group‘sassessment of impairment and reversal ct impairment of non-current assetsare set out in the ﬁnancial report in notes B 3 and BA,
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We evaluated the assumptions methodologies and conclusions used by the Groupin assessing tor indicators oi impairment, in particulari those relating to thedetermination of CGUs, forecast cash llows and inputs used to formulate them.This included assessing‘ in conjunction with our valuation specialists the discountrates foreign exchange rates and commodity prices With relerence to marketprices (where available), market research, market practice, market indices‘ brokerconsensus and historical performance.
We used the work of the Group's internal experts with respect to the hydrocarbonreserve assumptions used in the cash ﬂow iorecastsi This included understandingthe reserve estimation processes carried out, the Group‘s intemal certiﬁcationprocess for technical and commercial experts who are responsible tor reserves thedesign of the Group’s Petroleum Resources Management procedures and itsalignment with the guidelines prepared by the Society of Petroleum Engineers. Weagreed the updated reserves and resources estimates to the assessment atimpairment indicators calculation oi depreciationi depletion and amortisation ariddecommissioning provisions. We also examined the competence arid ohyectivity oithe Group's experts, the scope and appropriateness of their work We assessedwhether key reserves economics assumptions were consistent With otheroperational information We agreed cost assumptions to the latest approvedbudgets and forecasts
We also iocused on the adequacy of the ﬁnancial report disclosures regarding theassumptions to which the Group‘s assessment of indicators of impairment andreversal oi impairment otnon-current assets are most sensitive These have beendisclosed in Note 8.4
2. Accounting for petroleum resources rent tax (PRRT) assets
The consolidated lihancial statements of the Group include deten'ed taxassets arising trom PRRT and associated F'RRT tax beneﬁts, Thedetermination oi the quantum likelihood and timing of the realisation ofdeterred tax assets arising from PRRT is highly judgemental and assessedon a basis consistent With the impairment assumptions set out above as wellas other factors such as the long term bond rate applied to the timing ofdeductible expenditure, As such, this matter was considered to be a keyaudit matter.
The Group's disclosures about PRRT are included in the summary oisigniﬁcant accounting policies in Note A5,
How our audit addressed the key audit matter
We considered the application at the judgements and methodologies used by theGroup to calculate the deferred tax assets arising from PRRT and estimate theirutilisation iii the future. In particularwe assessed thosejudgements andmethodologies relating to the estimation ottuture FRRT assessable proﬁts. theinterpretation of PRRT legislation and the consistency in application olforecastedperiormance with other lorecasts made, including modelling of impairmentindicators.

If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we arerequired to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities ofthe directors for the financial report
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives a true and fair view in accordancewith Australian Accounting Standards and the Corporations Act 2001 and for such internal control as the directors determine isnecessary to enable the preparation of the ﬁnancial report that gives a true and fair view and is free from material misstatement,whether due to fraud or error.

Auditor's responsibilities for the audit ofthe financial report
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial report as a whole is free from material misstatement,whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditot’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level ofassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards will always detect amaterial misstatement when it exists.

As pan of an audit in accordance with the Australian Auditing Standards, we exercise professionaljudgment and maintainprofessional scepticism throughout the audit. We also:
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial report, whether due to ﬁ'aud or error, design and perform auditprocedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting trorn fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud mayinvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
> Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate inthe circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
> Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relateddisclosures made by the directors.
> Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the auditevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt onthe Company‘s ability to continue as a going concern If we conclude that a material unceitainty exists, we are required todraw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial report or, it such disclosures are inadequate,to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor‘s report,However, future events or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.
> Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁnancial report, including the disclosures, and whether theﬁnancial report represents the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
> Obtain sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the business activities within the entity toexpress an opinion on the ﬁnancial report. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the audit.We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion,
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiﬁcant auditﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.

We describe these matters in our auditor's report unlesslaw or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a mattershould not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected tooutweigh the public interest beneﬁts of such communication.

Capital allocation
In 2017 we generated $832 million free cash flow, a $718 millionincrease from 2016. Strong operating cash flow of $2,400 millioncontributed to this result.
We continue to fund investment in line with our strategy, with$1,563 million invested in capital and exploration expenditure.Our capital expenditure of $1,268 million decreased by
$885 million relative to 2016, predominantly due to theSenegal oil and Scarborough gas interests acqunsitions in 2016.Approximately 70% of our 2017 capital expenditure was investedin the Wheatstone LNG project, the Greater Enfield oil pr01ectand the NWS subsea tieback proiects, which are underpinningtargeted production of apprOXimately 100 MMboe in 2020.‘Wheatstone Train1 commenced LNG production in Q4 2017,with Train 2 expected to commence in 02 2018.
We continue to invest in exploration, w1th $295 million invested andwells drilled in Myanmar, Senegal, Gabon and Australia during 2017,
In 2017, we declared $826 million of dividends. equivalent to
98 cents per share (cps). This represents a dividend payout ratioof 80% of underlying NPAT, Our dividends are fully frahked forAustralian taxation purposes, and our gross dividend yield for2017 was 5.4%.
Unit production cost, cash costs and marginsTotal unit production costs increased by 4% to $5.2 per boe.
Gas unit production costs increased by 14% to $40 per boe dueto the impact of a Pluto minor turnaround on production volumesand higher associated costs, higher than average unit productioncosts for Wheatstone as production commenced in Q4 and theimpact of NWS pipeline gas venture equity reduction.
Oil unit production costs improved by 21% to $18.4 per boe.This was predominantly due to the increase in Okha FPSOproduction volume, combined With lower maintenance costs,tollowmg the completion of the 2016 dry dock. Operationsdiscontinued in 2016 also contributed to the reduction.
Gross margin increased by 19% from $19.4 to $23.0 per bee, andour break-even cash cost ofsales remains very competitive at$100 per bee. Our high margin. low cost operations continue tosupport both strong cash flows and increased profit.
Balance sheet, liquidity and debt service
During 2017, we maintainec our strong balance sheet and endedthe year with gearing of 24%, well within our target range of10% to 30%.
Our strong investment grade credit ratings of Baa1 and BBB+ werere-affirmed in 2017 by both oody's and S&P Global respectively.
We continue to actively manage our debt portfolio, minimisingnear-term maturities and maintaining a low cost of debt. Theaverage term to maturity 0 our debt is 4.7 years. and ourportfolio cost of debt remains competitive at 3.7%.
We are well supported by both bank and debt capitalmarkets. During 2017, the ollowmg new and refinancedfatilities were executed:

The LNG market is In a period of rapid expansion of supply. Strong global economic growth and demand for cleanerfuels have also driven very rapid growth in LNG demand. Earlier expectations of an extended period of oversupplyare giving way to a recognition that an LNG suppiy shortfail could emerge by the early 2020s Meeting this shortfall
requires near-term commitment from both LNG suppiiers and buyers to develop new resources
China,1ndia, Pakistan,South Korea and SoutheEast Asia have aiishown recent signs of LNG demand upside, supported by GDPgrowth and strong policy support,
In China, poiicy moves to increase gas use in the recent FiveYear Plan are starting to take effect New Chinese energypoliCies targeting urban air poliution. coal power retirementsand reliabiiity for renewables are expected to create additionainatural gas and LNG demand upside. LNG imports have fiiiedover 50% of gas demand growth in China over the iast twoyears, and this is expected to continue until the pipeline fromRussia and domestic supply comes online in the early 2020s
The Chinese Government targets gas having a 15% share of theenergy mix by 2030, up from 6% in 2017. Much of this growthis iikely to come from LNG imports, with new contractingexpected to begin imminently.

The 20T7 exploration and appraisal driliing campaign wassuccesstuily compieted ahead of scheduie and under budget.The campaign tested multipie play types, heipihg to reﬁneportfolio understanding and inform future driliing priorities.
WoodSide‘s farmaih to Blocks AD71,AD76 ahd AD78 expands ourposition in Myanmar and provides further expioration prospectsto support our northern gas hub development concept close to
eXistihg infrastructure and major growing gas markets.
During 2017, Woodside reeehtered ThalineTA and drilied anadditional appraisai weil, Thalih72, in Biock AD77 to betterunderstand the 2016 Thaiih discovery,
The ThalinaTA reeehtry was spudded as ThaiineTB. Core andWireiine iogs were successtuily acquired over the objectivereservoir intervals Drill stem testing demonstrated strong flowrates and high reservoir deiiverabiiity.
The Thalih72 appraisal well was driiied to test the northeasternend of the Thalih Fieid and encountered Simiiar quaiity reservou’to ThaliheiB, although with a shaliower gas/water contactindicating the existence of ihtraafieid compiexity.
Information acquired from the two appraisai weiis iS beinganalysed and wiil be used to inform future activities.
In August, Woodside made the Pyi Thit gas discovery in BiockA76, adding to the Thalin ahd Shwe Yee Htuh discoveriesannounced in 2016. The discovery buiids our understanding ofthe potentiai resources in the region and further informs ourCOhSideratiori of development options.
The Pyi Thit-i weil intersected a gross gas column of approximately65 m, A het gas pay of apprOXimately 36 m is interpreted withinthe primary target sandstone reserVOirs. Core and wireiine logswere acquired over the target zone A driil stem test confirmedstrong ﬂow rates with strong reservoir pressure support.
Two other expioration weils were drilied in Myanmar. The PyiTharyarai weil in Block A76 intersected a thin gas coiumn which isuniikeiy to be commercialiy recoverabie. The Khayahg SwaH weilin Block AD-7 intersected water-wet sands in the target interval.
Our 20T8 Myanmar expioration drilling campaign is scheduledto commence in Q2 2018 With the dhilihg ota weii in Biock ADai.This Wili be followed by the drilling of a prospect in Biock A-7.Both are iarge volume prospects and are Simiiar piay types
as preyious discoveries. The driiiihg ofa further expioration/appraisal weli in Block A76 remains subiect to necessary jointventure and government approvals.

Scarborough Development
Woodside's Scarborough area interests include the Scarborough. Thebe andJupiter gas ﬁelds, which are estimated to contain gross (100%) contingentresources (2C) of 9.2 W of dry gas, The estimate is based on a reviseddevelopment scenario utilising existing Woodside-operated infrastructureon the Burrup Hub.
On 14 February 2018. Woodside announced it had entered into a bindingSale and Purchase Agreement to acquire ExxonMobii's 50% interest inWA-i-R, which contains the Scarborough gas fieid, Upon completion ofthetransaction, which is targeted by end Q12018,Woodside wili have a 75%interest in WA-1-R and a 50% interest in WA-61-R, WA-62-R and WA-63-R.‘
Completion of the transaction wiii increase Woodside’s net share of thecontingent resources (2C) in the Scarborough area assets from 2.8 W ofdry gas to 6.4 1d of dry gas.
By providing greater aiignment between Woodside’s upstream resourcesand downstream infrastructure and greater control over and certainty ofdevelopment, this acquisition supports Woodside’s strategy of unlockingshareholder value. This is expected to create a pathway to developmentof the material, unaliocated Scarborough gas ﬁeld through a iower—costbrownfield expansion ofour high-reiiability Pluto LNG faciiity.
In 2017, the Scarborough Joint Venture commenced engagement withthird-party infrastructure owners in Western Australia to explore options toprocess Scarborough gas and in December executed a Joint Technical StudyAgreement with the NWS Project to determine the technical viability ofprocessing gas through the NWS infrastructure.
Woodside is targeting a Scarborough concept seiect decision in 2018, withFEED targeted in 2019 and FID in 2020. First production from the developmentis expected in 2025 to meet the expected globai LNG supply gap.

Sustainability performance
Woodside’s corporate scorecard includes metrics reﬂectingour material sustainability issues. Woodside's sustainabilityperformance is also linked to remuneration for employeesand executives,
We respond to a range of enVironmental, social and governancespecific indices, inciuding the Dow Jones Sustainabiiity Index(DJSI). WoodSide received a Siiver Class distinction fromRobecoSAM‘ for its DJSI sustainabiiity performance, piecing usin the top 3% when ranked against our peers in the oil and gasupstream and integrated sector.
United Nations Sustainable Development GoalsThe United Nations Sustainable Deveiopment Goals (UNSDG)aim to address some of the world’s most pressing economic.environmentai and social chalienges. Whiie the response to
the UNSDG is led by national governments, business mustunderstand where opportunities exist to contribute to
UNSDG targets.

In December 2017, Woodside announced an agreement withABB Australia Pty Ltd to install a lithium-ion battery energystorage system on the GWA platform. The installation of
the 1 megawatt hour battery will reduce the need for back-
up capacity (known as spinning reserve) in GWA platform’spower generation system and is expected to reduce fuel gasconsumption by more than 2,000 tonnes per year. This isestimated to decrease the platform’s fuel gas emissions by 5%and positions Woodside as an early adopter of battery storagetechnology in oil and gas operations.
During 2017, we completed the installation of WiFi across all KGPLNG trains. In 2018, we will connect the remainder of the plant toWiFi, providing site-wide availability. WiFi provides employeeswith greater access to services and support in the field, improvingproductivity and plant availability. The KGP WiFi technologyprovides a fast and cost-effective way ofacquiring additionaldata to support operations and business decision making.
Woodside also continues to invest in FutureLab, ourcollaboration hubs based at Monash and Curtin Universities andthe University of Western Australia, that supports the deliveryof our Intelligent Enterprise, Plant of the Future and OffshoreTransformation work programs
GYBER-SEGURITY
A cyber incident presents a risk to the integrity and availability of Woodside’s operations and the confidentiality of corporateinformation Globally, cyberesecurity threats remain persistent and adversarial With an evereincreasing level of frequency,sophistication and severity. Woodside manages a range of risk controls to ensure adequate protection from, detection of

Climate change
Woodside has a Climate Change Policy and a defined climatechange approach focused on:
+ Ensuring the resilience of our portfolio
+ Improving the carbon performance ofour facilitiesand developments
+ Communicating the future role of gas.
Resilience of our portfolioAs part of Woodside’s business planning, we have modelledlongeterm energy outlook scenarios.
We use our standard business processes to manage the risksand opportunities associated with climate change. Our latestClimate Disclosure Project (CDP) response also details howthese processes apply to our approach to climate change.

(9 Refer to Woodside’s website for our CDP response(www.woodside.com.au).

Improving carbon performance
Woodside continues to invest in and promote technologies thatreduce emissions and promote energy efficiency in our currentand future facilities Woodside is evolving to meet the challengesof a low carbon economy, in which LNG will be a key resource.
As the lowest emissions fossil fuel, LNG can reduce emissions byreplacing oil or coal. In the long term, LNG has an important rolein the energy mix, including providing low—emissions, reliablepower as the rise of renewables increases intermittency inpower generation
Communicating the future role of gas
We acknowledge that our investors, regulators and otherstakeholders want us to be transparent about the impact ofclimate change on our business.
We continue to deliver natural gas as a key part ofthe Iong-termenergy mix. About 90% of the emissions from Woodside’s valueChain comes from our customers using our products. This meanshat the greatest opportunities to impact global emissions comerom how and where our customers use our products.

LNG FUELS
We are building a truck»loading facility at our Pluto LNG facility to support the switch to LNG from higher»emitting fuels such
as diesel in heavy transport and in remote power generation throughout the resourceirich Pilbara region. If even a third ofthe Pilbara’s diesel is replaced by LNG, it could reduce Australia's emissions by up to 2 million tCOge, or more than 50% ofWoodside’s direct emissions.

This year, we extended our process safety curriculum andcompetency assessment program to brownfieids contractors atthe Karratha Gas Plant This is part of a broader focus to makeprocess safety real and relevant to ali employees and contractors.To date, over 350 contractors have completed the training,
Perfect HSE Day
Woodside’s safety performance has continued to improveWith a 69% reduction in Totai Recordable injury Rate (TRIR)since 2012. To support ongoing improvement and to increasepersonal ownership of Health, Safety, Environment (HSE)performance. the Perfect HSE Day concept was launched acrossthe organisation in 2017. The concept makes a positive changeby creating a common language which consolidates existingHSE processes and tools under a global HSE banner. Theconcept was the focus of Woodside’s annual Stand Togetherfor Safety week. Since the launch of the Perfect HSE Day andin conjunction with other HSE act1v1t1es. Woodside’s heaith andpersonal safety performance has improved, achieving the bestTRIR performance to date.
Peer recognition
In May 2017, Woodside was awarded both the AustralianPetroleum Production & Expioration Association (APPEA)Safety Exceilence Award and the APPEA EnvironmentExceiience Award for our performance, leadership andcollaboration in safety and environmental management.

continuous improvement. in March 2017, the Watson for HSEQdata analytics and cognitive computing tooi was created toanaiyse large amounts of information and present it in anaccessible manner. The tool has already digested more than30 years of incident and operational data to heip anaiyseinformation to better manage risks. Watson for HSEQ is aisovaluabie in supporting incident investigations. improving thequality of our learning from incidents and supporting riskassessments and hazard studies.
Workplace health
To support Woodside‘s global growth, an integrated traveirisk management solution was implemented to manage healthexposure for business travellers and empioyees based in ourinternational ofﬁces. The new travel risk management soiutionconsolidated three systems, streamiined processes and aiignsWith leading practice in travei risk management.
Woodside is a supporter of mental health awareness, activelyparticipating in World Mentai Health Day and the R U OK?initiative as weil as contributing to committees promotingmental health across the community.
HSE Representatives Network
Our HSE Representatives Network inciudes140+frontiineWoodside employees and contractors from across ourproduction assets who have committed to promoting health.safety and environment in the workplace. Our representativesare important HSE leaders and change agents and have acriticai role in continumg to lift our HSE performance andculture. The 2017 HSE Representatives improvement projecthas delivered greater structure, role c1arity.ﬁt-for-purposeresources and improved support for this network. More than70 representatives attended two HSE forums held in late 2017to share success stories, create stronger networks and engagein HSE professional development activities.
Environment performance
Woodside HSEQ policy underpins our aim to minimise theimpact of our operations on the environment in which we
work. To support our goal of achieving 5% energy efficiencyimprovement by end 2020, fuei intensity metrics for WOOdSidEoperated production assets continued to be monitored in 2017.Whiist fuel intenSity performance slightly exceeded target. apathway to achieVing our goal has been established with anumber of additional energy efficiency broiects scheduled to beimpiemented in 2018 and 2019.
In 2017, Woodside implemented emissions savings projectstotalling approximateiy 61 kt COZe. Whiie 2017 performance wasslightly above target, Woodside has renewed our commitmentto achieving 5% energy efficiency improvement by imbiementing389 kt C02e of sustained emissions savings by end 2020.
Annual fiare performance was affected by unplanned outagesat our onshore gas plants, Maintenance activities involving theﬂare system at the KGP are expected to improve performancein the ﬁrst half of 2018.
Biodiversity
Robust science is core to WoodSide’s environmentalmanagement approach and processes. We rely on having thebest knowledge to support our understanding of the iocaienVironment and our potentiai impacts upon it. in 2017, wecontinued our coliabora’tion with our partners such as deLife,Fauna and Fiora International (FFi), Wiidiife ConservationSociety (WCS), Australian Institute of Marine Science (AIMS)and the Western Austraiian Museum.
The overali goai of our partnership with WCS in Myanmar is
to develop a deeper understanding of the ﬁshing communityand marine environment along some of Myanmar's westerncoastiine. In parallel, a collaboration with FFI and Myanmar'sPathein University aims to buiid the capacity of marine sciencestaff and students to understand and assess Myanmar‘s coastaiand marine habitats. Our current work with BirdLife is focusedon the East Asian Australian Flyway (EAAF),
Woodside continues to coinvest in marine environmentaiseience With research-based organisations and universities inAustralia and overseas.

RISK
Woodside maintains a robust and discipiinedfocus on operational excelience and effective riskmanagemeht‘ We do this so that we understandand manage risk to help achieve our objectives,
Our risk management process IS designed to recognise andmanage risks that have the potential to materiaily impactWoodside’s business obiectives. The process is aiigned toInternationai Standard iSOEiOOO for risk management andassesses potential risks in areas such as health and safety,enVironment, finance, reputation and brand, iegai andcompiiance, and sociai and cultural impacts

Refer to the Sustainabie Development Report 20i7 formore information on sustainabiiity issues of importanceto our stakeholders and our busmess.




® Refer to Woodside’s Corporate Governance Statementfor more information (www.woodside.c0m.au/Working-Sustainany/governance-and-combiiance).

An overview of our material risks is summarised below.

CONTEXT
Our future growthdepends on our abilityto identify, acquire,explore and developreserves.

RISK
Unsuccessfui exploration and renewal of upstream
resources may impede delivery of our strategy.

MITIGATION
Exposure to reserve depletion is addressed
by our comprehenSive expioration strategytogether with our capability in geosciencesand deep-water exploration Our disciplinedmanagement of opportunities and acquisitions,together with the application of newtechnologies and recovery processes, furtheraddresses this risk.

The commerciallyrecoverable quantity ofgas, oil and condensatewithin reserves
is estimated withreasonable certaintybased on anticipatedconditions.
Estimates of economicaily recoverabie reserves arebased upon a number of factors and assumptions,such as geological and engineering estimates andJudgements. the assumed effects of governmentregulation and estimates of future commodityprices and operating costs, ail of which may vary
conSiderabiy from actual resuits. Variation in reserve
quantities may resuit in iower future productionvolumes. impairment ofassets or decreasedearnings, cash flows and financiai performance.
Our framework of petroleum resources andreservoir management processes provideassurance for reserves estimation andreporting. These incorporate the WoodsideReserves Policy, the Petroleum ResourcesManagement Procedure and competency andtraining minimum requirements.
Our reserves are also reviewed throughexternal audits,

Efficient andcost-competitivecommercialisationof hydrocarbonsis a contributor toour success.
A failure to successtu Iy commerciaiise ourhydrocarbons by seiecting subiobtimaidevelopment options or failing to executeprojects the achieve cost, quality and scheduleexpectations may recuce the value we can securefrom future developments and negativeiy impactour financia performance
Central to the management of this i'iSk isour focus on creating effective commerciaiarrangements with a range of partitipants,stakeholders and contractors.
in addition, we continue to invest in robust andhighiquaiity opportunity deveiopment andproiect management systems

Safety, reliability andintegrity in productionand delivery ofhydrocarbon productsinfluence our licence tooperate and our abilityto achieve superiorshareholder returns.
Sustained. unpiannec interruption to productionmay impact our licence to operate and financial
performance. Our taciiities are subiect to operating
hazards. inc ement weather and disruption
to suppiy chain, whic can resuit in a loss ofhydrocarbon containment, diminished production,additionai costs. environmental damage or harmto our peop e. reputation or brand.
Our extenSive framework of controls enabiesthe management of these risks. This includesproduction processes, drilling and compietionsand weiI-integrity management processes.inspection and maintenance procedures andperformance standards. This framework issupported by the ongoing engagement wehave with regulators.

Our business relies ona variety of informationtechnology systems;

The integrity, availabi ity and reiiabiiity of datawithin Wooc5ide's information and operations
technoiogy systems may be subject to intentionai or

unintentiona disruption (e.g. cyber security attack),
Our exposure to cyber security risk ismanaged by a robust controi frameworkand the continumg focus on system controiimprovements, supported by an estabiishedand embedded security strategy across
the organisation.

‘Reserves’ are estimated quantities of petroieum that have beendemonstrated to be produmbie from known accumuiations in whichthe company has a materiai interest from a given date forward. atcommeraal rates. under presently antiapated production methods,operating conditions, prices and costs
Assessment of the economic vaiue ot a prOJect, in support of areserves booking, uses Woodside Porttoiio Economic Assumptions(PEAS), The PEAs are reviewed on an annuai basis or more often ifrequired. The reView is based on historicai data and forecast estimatesfor economic variables such as product prices and exchange rates.The PEAs are approved by the Woodside Board. Specific contractuaiarrangements for individuai projects are also taken into account.
Woodside uses both deterministic and probabiiistic methods forestimation of petroleum resources at the fieid and DVOJECI1SVE1S,UH1SSSotherWIse stated.a11 betroieum estimates reported at the company orregion level are aggregated by arithmetic summation by category. Notethat the aggregated Proved level may be a very conservative estimatedue to the portfolio effects of arithmetic summation,
Woodside reports reserves net of the fuel and ﬂare required forproduction, processing and transportation up to a reference point.For Offshore Oil proyects, the reference p0int is deﬁned as the outietof the ﬂoating production storage and offloading faciiity (FPSO).For onshore LNG proiects, the reference point is defined as theinlet to the downstream (onshore) brocessmg tacﬂity, For offshoreLNG proiects (ﬂoating 1iquefied natural gas (FLNGD. the referencepciht is defined as the outlet of the FLNG faCiIity. Downstream fueland ﬂare represents 9.5% of WoodSIde's Proved (Developed andUndeveloped) reserves, and 99% of Proved plus Probab1e(Deye10bedand Undeveloped) reserves.
Contingent resources' are those quantities or petroieum estimated,as of a given date, to be potentiaily recoverabie from knownaccumulations, but the applied project(s) are not yet consideredmature enough for commercial development due to one or morecontingencies. Contingent resources may include, for exampie,proiects for which there are currently no Viable markets. or wherecommercral recovery is dependent on technology under deveiopment.or where evaiuation of the accumulation is mSUTfiClent to clearlyassess commerCIaiity. WOOdSlde reports contingent resources
net of the fuel and ﬂare required for production, brocessmg andtransportation Up to a reference paint and non-hydrocarbons notpresent in sales products. Contingent resources estimates may notaiways mature to reserves and do not necessariiy represent futurereserves bookings. All contingent resource voiumes are reported atthe ‘Best Estimate (P50) confidence level.
'Dry gas' is defined as ‘C4 minus’ petroleum components includingnon-hydrocarbons. These volumes include LPG (propane and butane)resources. Dry gas reserves and contingent resources inciude ‘CArnihus‘ hydrocarbon components and non-hydrocarbon voiumes thatare present in sales product.
’Condensate' is defined as ‘CS bius' petroleum components.
’Bcf' means biliions (109) of cu biC feet of gas at standard Oilfieidconditions or14696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degrees Fahrenheit(15.56 degrees Ceisius).
'MMbbi' means miilions (105) of barrels of oil and condensate atstandard Olitield conditions of 14.696 psi (101.325 kPa) and 60 degreesFahrenheit (15.56 degrees Celsms).
'MMboe' means miilions (106) of barrels of 0|1 equivaient. ConSistentwrth internationai practice, dry gas volumes are converted to 011equivaient yoiumes Via a constant conversion factor, which forWoodside is 57 Ed of dry gas ber1 MMboe. Volumes of oii andcondensate are converted from MMbbi to MMboe on a 1:1 ratio.
'Proved reserves' are those reserves which anaiysis of geoibgicaiand engineering data suggests, to a high degree of certainty (90%confidence), are recoverable. There is relatively little risk assooatedWith these reserves.
'Probable reserves’ are those reserves which anainIs of geoicigi'cai andengineering data suggests are more likely than not to be recoverabie.Proved pius Probable reserves represent the best estimate ofrecoverable quantities. Where probabilistic methods are used. there
is at ieast a 50% probabiiity that the quantities actuaiiy recovered W111exceed the sum of estimated Proved plus Probabie reserves.

'Deveioped reserves' are those reserves that are produoble throughcurrehtiy eXisting compietions and instailed tacﬂities for treatment.compreSSion, transportation and delivery. usmg eXisting operatingmethods and standards.
‘Undeveioped reserves' are those reserves for which welis andfaciiities have not been installed or executed but are expected to berecovered through future investments.
The ‘reseryes replacement ratio’ is the reserves (Developed andUndeveioped) change during the year, before the deduction ofproduction, divided by production during the year. The 'three-year reserves rebiacement ratio’ is the reserves (Developed andUndeveioped) change over three years, before the deduction ofproduction for that period. diVided by production during thesame period.
The ‘organic annuai reserves replacement ratio’ is the reserves(Deveioped and Undeveioped) change during the year, beforethe deduction of production and adiustment for acquisition anddivestments, diVided by production during the year.
The ‘reserves iife’ is the reserves (Developed and Undeveloped)divided by production during the year.
‘Annual production’ is the volume of dry gas, condensate and
Oil produced during the year and converted to ‘MMboe’ for thespeCific purpose of reserves reconCiliation and the calculation ofreserves replacement ratios. The ‘Reserves and resources statement’annual production differs from production voiumes reported in
the company's annual and quarteriy reports due to differencesbetween the saies and reserves product definitions, reserves reportedgross of downstream fuei and ﬂare and the ‘MMboe' converSionfactors appiied.
‘ReVision of preVious estimates’ are changes in preyious estimates ofreserves or contingent resources, either up or down, resulting fromnew information normally obtained from deveiopment driiling andproduction history or resulting from a change in economic factors orreserVOir modeliing to estimate volumes reasonabiy expected to berecovered from weils in the relevant broyect.
‘Extehswns and discoveries‘ represent additions to reserves orcontingent resources that result from increased areal extensionsof preyiously discovered fields, discovery of reserves or contingentresources in new fields, or new reservoirs in old fields.
The ‘Greater Pluto’ region comprises the PlutoeXena, Larsen, Marteil,Martin, Noblige, Pyxis and Remy fields.
The ‘North West Shelf‘ (NW8) includes all oil and gas fieids within theNorth West Shelf Proyect Area. As the NWS con5ists of a portfolio ofTle1dS,pl’Obabl1IStiC aggregation is more appropriate than arithmeticsummation as Ihter-ﬂeld dependenCIes reﬂecting different reserVOircharacteristics between fields are incorporated. Probabiiisticaggregation of ihdIVIdual f'ieids in the NWS accounts for 17.5% of NWSProved (Developed and Undeveloped) dry gas reserves and 22.7% ofNWS Proved (Deveioped and Undeveloped) condensate reserves.
The ‘Greater Exmouth' region comprises the Vincent, Enfield, GreaterEnfield, Greater Laverda, Ragnar and Tom fields.
The ‘Wheatstone’ region comprises the Julimar arid Bruneilo fieids.
The ‘Canada' region comprises unconventionai resources in theLiard Basin,
The ‘Greater Browse’ region comprises the Brecknock. Calli'ance andTeresa fields.
The ‘Greater Scarborough' region comprises the Jupiter, Scarboroughand Thebe fields.
The ‘Greater Sunrise' region comprises the Sunrise and Troubadour fields‘The Myanmar‘ region comprises the Shwe Yee Htun and Thaiin fieidsThe ‘Senegai' region comprises the SNE field.
Material concentrations of undeveloped reserves in Greater Pluto andNorth West Shelf have remained undeveioped for ionger than ﬁveyears from the dates they were initiaily reported, as the incrementaireserves are expected to be recovered through future deveiopmentsto meet iong-term contractual commitments. The incrementaiproyects are inciuded in the company business bian, demonstratingthe intent to proceed With the developments.

Scorecard measures and outcomes
The Board assesses executive management performance on an ahhuai basis agaihst a balanced scorecard of measures that aim to drivebusiness performance and the creation of shareholder value.
The 2017 scorecard for executive KMP is based on four equaiiy weighted measures that have been chosen because they impact long andshort-term shareholder value, With a score of one for an outcome at target and a maXimum score of two on each measure. The Board setschallenging yet realistic targets for each measure with sufficient stretch to promote continuous improvement and superior performance.
In 2017, WOOdSide continued to deiiver across operationai assets With strong safety performance. A solid NPAT result was deiivered
despite a iowerthah expected production outcome. Woodsnde further capitaiised on its strong balance sheet to create ahd buiid near-term vaiue and growth opportunities. The majority of busmess piah priorities were met and we are weil positioned to deiiver across aiithree growth horizons. Accordingly, the Board determined a scorecard outcome of1.2 out of a maxnmum oitwo for executive KMP for
the 2017 performance year,‘

N PAT
Profit after tax performance is closeiy aligned With short-termshareholder value creation. NPAT IS underpinned by operationaiperformance, oii price and foreign exchange rates This measurefocuses management on driVing exceptional operatiohai performance,with the Board ensuring that shortrterm results are not achieved at theexpense of longer term performance. NPAT outcomes, and thereforethe short- term awards. are exposed to the upside and downside of oiiprice and foreign exchange fluctuations. as are returns to shareholders

+ in 2017, Woodside delivered NPAT of $1.024 miiiion.an 18% increase on 2016, This was due to higher reaiisedprices. iower depreciation expense primarily drivenby an increase In deveioped reserves; reieaseof Bainaves termination prowsion: and iowerexploration and evaluation expense. This wasoffset by lower revenue primarily from lower salesvoiumes and Pluto LNG sale prices. The Bainavesprovision release and lower depreciation expensewere not Included In the scorecard.
DELIVERY AGAINST BUSINESS PLAN
Woodside's annual business plan commitments aim to deliverIong—term shareholder value. The commitments are structured
under four categories; grow the portfolio (e.g. resource replacement,concept select decisions, commercialisation of international asses, tie-back opportu nities); grow the market (e.g. capture new markets, maturegas to power opportunities): operational excellence (e.g. operatingexpenditure, unit production costs, reliability); and capability (e.g.diversity, social licence to operate, disciplined opportu nity financing).

Non-executive Directors (NEDs)
Remuneration PolicyWoodside's Remuneration Policy for NEDs aims to attract. retain. mottvate and to remunerate fairly and responsibly having regard to:
+ the level of fees paid to NEDS relative to other major Austratian compames
+ the size and complexity of Woodstde’s operations
+ the responsibttities and work requirements of Board members
Fees paid to NEDs are recommended by the HR&C Committee based on benchmarking from external remuneration consuttants, and
determined by the Board. subject to an aggregate Hmt‘t ofA$3.75 millton per ﬁnanoat year, which was approved by sharehotders atthe 2014 AGM.
The Woodside minimum shareholding requirement for NEDs increased in 2016, with NEDs now required to have acqutred shares for atotat purchase price of at least 50% ottheir preetax annuat fee after four years on the Board, The NEDs may utilise the NoneExecuttveDtrectors‘ Share Ptan (NEDSP) to acquire the shares on market at market value. As the shares are acqutred with net fees the shares inthe NEDSP are not subject to any forfeiture conditions.
NEDs remuneration structure
NEDs remuneration consists of base Board fees and committee fees, plus statutory superannuation contributions or payments in Heu(currently 95%). Other payments may be made for additionat services outside the scope of Board and committee duties‘ NEDs donot earn retirement beneﬁts other than superannuation and are not entitled to any form of performance—Iinked remuneration.
For the third consecutive year, NEDs received no increase in their fees, Tabte 7 below shows the annual base Board and committeetees for NEDs.
In addition to these fees, NEDs are entttted to reimbursement of reasonable travet accommodation and other expenses incurredattending meetings of the Board, committees or sharehotders, or while engaged on Woodside business NEDS are not entttted tocompensation on termination of their directorshtps.
Board fees are not paid to the CEO. as the time spent on Board work and the responsibilities of Board membership are considered indetermining the remuneration package provided as part of the normal emptoyment condtttons.
The total remuneratton paid to, or in respect of, each NED in 2017 ‘8 set out in Tabte 12 on page 93.
