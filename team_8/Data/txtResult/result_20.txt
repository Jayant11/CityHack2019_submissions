For the year ended 31 December 2017, the Group has a tclx charge of £5m (2016: £10m) excluding the tax relating to ioint ventures andassociates. Together with the release of a total of £17m provision in relation to exposures in Singapore that were finalised In 2017, the Grouprecorded a tax credit of £12m.
The effective tax rate relating to the tax charge of 25m before the release of provision is 4.2% (2016: 12.2%). The effective tax rate has beenaffected by a number of factors which include the following items:
' Other income and expense of the Group;' Reduced tax rates applied to brought forward net deferred tax liabilities in the US; and' Tax odiustments in respect of previous years.
Excluding the impact of the items noted above. the Group's underlying effective tax rate is 9.2% (2016: 15.4%).
The US enacted a corporate tax reform in December 2017. The future reduction in the US corporate income tax rate has reduced thecarwing values of both deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting in an immaterial net impact to the current year results.

Adjustments in respect of settlement of prior years’ tax liab as
The Group's tax charge on ordinary activities is the sum of the total current and deferred tax charges. The calcutotion of the Group's total
tax charge necessarily involves a degree of estimation and Iudgement in respect of certain items whose tax treatment cannot be finaLly
determined Until resolution has been reached with the relevant tox authority or. as appropriate. through (:1 formal legal process. The finalresolution of some of these items may give rise to mateﬁal profit and loss und/or cash flow variances. The geographical complexity of theGroup's structure makes the degree of estimation and judgement more choltenging. The resolution of issues is not always within the controlof the Group and it is often dependent on the efficacy of the legal processes in the relevant tax iurisdictions in which the Group operates.

a Impairment
Property. plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment based on each cash generating Unit (“CGU”). The CGUs are individual hoteis.The carrying value of individual hotels was compared to the recoverable amount of the hotels. which was derived with the reference to fairvalue through creation of discount cash flow models. Under this methodology, the fair value measurement reflects current marketexpectations about the third party efficient operator is future cash flows, discounted to their present value. The underlying basis for theimpairment model involves each hotel's proiected cash flow for the financial year ending 31 December 2015. extrapolated to incorporateindividual assumptions in respect of revenue growth (principally factoring in room rate and occupancy growth) and maior expense lines.The future cash flows are based on assumptions about competitive growth rates for hotels in that area. as well as internal business plans.These plans and forecasts include management's most recent view of trading prospects for the hotel in the relevant market. Whereappropriate, the Directors sought guidance on value from a registered independent appraiser with an appropriately recognisedprofessional qualification and recent experience in the location and category of the hotel being valued.
On the basis of external valuations in 2017. the Group recorded an impairment charge of £34m consisting of £11m in New York. £13m in Restof Asia. £6m far Rest of US and £4m in Rest of Europe. For 2016, a total impairment charge of £28m (including the impairment of a REITproperty of £4m) was recognised in relation to £15m in New York, £5m in Rest of Europe, £2m in Rest of Asia and £2m for Regional USAFurther information is given in Note 12.
Circumstances and events that led to the impairment are disclosed in the Financial Performance review on page 11.
b Key assumptions used by the external appraisersThe key assumptions used were as follows:
Pre-tax discount rate — The discount rate is based on the counth/ in which the hotel is located and is adiusted for risks associated with thehotel. Discount rates ranged from 6% to 12% in the US. 6% to 12% in Europe and 10% in Asia.
Occupancy rate — The occupancy growth rates ranged from 2% to 13% in the US. 1% to 17% in Europe and 3% to 9% in Asia.Average room rate — The average room rate growth ranged from 2% to 6% in the US. 1% to 25% in Europe and 1% to 12% in Asia.Terminal rate — These rates ranged from 7% to 10% in the US, 6% to 9% in Europe and 4% to 8% in Asia,
The forecasts cover a five to ten year period, and cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using 0 growth rate ranging between 2%and 3%. which is based Upon the expected trading growth for each hotel and inflation in the country.
c Sensit ties
The Group's Impairment review is sensitive to changes in the key assumptions used, most notably the discount rates and revenue growthassumptions. Based on the Group's sensitivity analysis. a reasonably possible change in a single factor could result in impairment in certainhotels in London. Regional UK. Regional US. Asia and Australasia as theirfair value currently exceeds their carwing value only by a smallpercentage.
d Land and buildings
Land and buildings includes long leasehold building assets with a book value of £669m (2016: £645m). The net book value of land andbuildings held Under short leases was £105m (2016: £109m). in respect of which depreciation of £3m (2016: 22m) was charged during theyear.
No interest was capitalised within land and buildings during the year (2016: Enil). The cumulative capitalised interest within land andbuildings is 25m (2016: 25m).
e Pledged assetsAt year-end. the net book value of assets pledged as colioteral for secured loans was £456m (2016: £526m). The security for the loans is byway of charges on the properties of the Group companies concerned.

FINANCIAL PERFORMANCE
For the full year to 31 December 2017, total revenue increased by 6.9% to £1,008m (2016: £926m) mainly due to favourable foreigncurrency movements as a result of the weak pound against major currencies and higher hotel revenue. The Group’s reported revenuebeneﬁted from a positive foreign exchange impact of £46m during the year. Total revenue in constant currency was 3.7% higher as
compared to last year.

Reported proﬁt before tax increased
by 36.1% to £147m (2016: £108m), Duringthe year. a total of £29m (2016: £44m) ofnet revaluation and impairment losseswere charged to the income statement.The impairment losses are a resutt of theGroup's impairment testing whereby thecarrying amount of assets is comparedagainst the estimated recoverable amount.which is the greater of the fair value lesscosts to sell and value in use. In assessingthe value in Use, the estimated future cashﬂows are discounted to their present valueusing a discount rate that reﬂects currentmarket assessments of the time value ofmoney and the risks speciﬁc to each asset.
After removing the effects of theimpairment losses and revaluation
gains. the Group's reported proﬁt beforetax is £176m (2016: £152m). Proﬁt was
also impacted by the release of £3maccruals no longer required in relationto the Glyndebourne proiect which wascompleted in 2013. Finance cost was alsolower by £5m in 2017.
Basic earnings per share increased by56.6% to 36.1p (2016: 24.0p).
The Company publishes its Group ﬁnancialstatements in sterling, However. themaiority of the Company's subsidiaries.[oint ventures and associates report
their revenue, costs, assets and liabilities
in currencies other than sterling. TheCompany translates the revenue. costs,assets and liabilities of those subsidiaries.ioint ventures and associates into sterling

(b) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group's approach to managing
liquidity is to ensure. us far as possible, that it will always have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal andstressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damage to the Group's reputation.
The following are the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including estimated interest payments using the interest rates prevailing
as at the reporting date.

(c) Market riskMarket risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices wilt affect the Group'sincome or the value of its holdings of financiat instruments:
The primary obiectives of the treasury function are to provide secure and competitively priced funding for the activities of the Group and toidentify and manage financial risks. including exposure to movements in interest and foreign exchange rates arising from those activities. Ifappropriate, the Group uses financial instruments and derivatives to manage these risks. as set out below.
(1) Foreign currency risk
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on revenue. purchases, borrowings and cash deposits denominated in currencies other thanthe functional currencies of the respective Group entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily US dollars, Singapore dollars,New Zealand dollars, New Taiwan dollars. Korean won, Chinese renminbi. Japanese yen and Euro.
The Group's principal policy, wherever possible, is to maintain a natural hedge whereby liabilities are matched with assets denominated inthe same currency: Foreign currency investment exposure is also minimised by borrowing in the currency of the investment.
To mitigate foreign currency translation exposure. an appropriate proportion of net assets are designated as hedged againstcorresponding financial liabilities in the same currency.

Net investment hedging
The Group has US$163m (2016: US$162m) US dollar loans and overdrafts and €7m (2016: €61m) Euro loans and overdrafts designated ashedges of corresponding respective proportions of its net investment in foreign operations whose functional currencies are US dollars andEuros. The risk being hedged is the foreign currency exposure on the carwing amount of the net assets of the foreign operation uponconsolidation. The fair value of the hedging instruments as at 31 December 2017 was £128m (2016: £165m).
An analysis of borrowings by currency and theirfair values as at 31 December is given below:

Exchange differences arising on foreign currency loans during each accounting period are recognised as a component of equity. to theextent that the hedge is effective. The foreign exchange exposure arising on the Group's net investment in its subsidiaries is expected to behighly effective in offsetting the exposure arising on the Group’s foreign currency borrowings. However during the year there was animmateriai amount (2016: Enil) recognised in the consolidated income statement that arose from hedges of net investments in foreignoperations that were considered to be ineffective.
Foreign currency transaction exposure is primarily managed through funding of purchases from operating income streams arising in thesome currency.
Hedging of transaction exposure is undertaken with approved counterparties and within designated limits. using spot or short-term fonNardcontracts to buy or sell the currency concerned, once the timing and the underlying amount of exposure have been determined. Foreignexchange derivatives may also be used to hedge specific transaction exposure where appropriate. There are no foreign exchangederivatives in place at 31 December 2017.

Sensitivity analysis
With respect to the Group's foreign currency exposure. and assuming that all other variables. in particular interest rates. remain constant. itis estimated that a 10% strengthening of sterling against the following currencies at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 10%) would haveincreased/(decreased) equity and profit before tax by the amounts shown below:

US dollar 33 4 35 1Australian dollar (8) (1) (3) —Singapore dollar 5 (4) 5 1New Taiwan dollar - (1) - 1New Zealand dollar (1) (4) (6) 3Euro 3 9 -Chlnese renminbi (4) (2) (4) eHong Kong dollar - (1) - 1Japanese Yen 2 (2) 2 1Thai Baht - (1) — —
30 (12) 41 5

A 10% weakening of sterling against the above currencies at 31 December 2017 (31 December 2016: 10%) would have had the equal butopposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shown above. on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
(ii) Interest rate risk and interest rate swaps
The Group adopts a policy of ongoing review of its exposure to changes in interest rates on its borrowings, taking into account marketexpectations with regard to the perceived level of risk associated with each currency, the maturity profile and cash flows of the Underlyingdebt. and the extent to which debt may potentially be either prepaid prior to its maturity or refinanced at reduced cost.
The Group's policy is to maintain a mixture of its financial liabilities on a fixed and floating-rate basis with a greater emphasis on floatingrates presently as this flexibility is considered to be appropriate in the context of the Group's overall geographical diversity. investment andbusiness cycle and the stability of the income streams, cash balances and loan covenants.
Interest rate derivatives are used to manage interest rate risk, to the extent that the perceived cost is considered to outweigh the benefitfrom the flexibility of variable rate borrowings, and the Group actively monitors the need and timing for such derivatives. Where used,interest rate derivatives are classified as cash flow hedges and stated at fair value within the Group's consolidated statement of financialposition. Further details of interest rate derivatives in place at 31 December 2017 are provided hereafter.
Cash flow sensitivity analysis for variable rate instruments
Assuming that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant, a change of one percentage point in the averageinterest rates applicable to variable rate instruments for the year would have increased/(decreased) the Group's profit before tax for theyear as shown below:

Estimation of fair values
The following summarises the moior methods and assumptions used in estimating the fair values of financial instruments reflected in thetable.
DerivativesForward exchange contracts are either marked to market using listed market prices or by discounting the contractual forward price anddeducting the current spot rate. For interest rate swaps, bank valuations are used.
Interest-bearing loans and barrowingsFair value is calculated based on discounted expected future principal and interest cash ﬂows.
Finance lease liabilitiesThe fair value is estimated as the present value of future cash flows. discounted at market interest rates for similar lease agreements. Theestimated fair values reflect changes in interest rates.
Trade and other receivables/puyablesFor receivables/poyobles with a remaining life of less than one year, the notional amount is deemed to reflect the fair voiue. All otherreceivables/poyobles are discounted to determine the fair value.
Interest rates used for determining fair valuePrevailing market interest rates are Used to discount cash flows to determine the fair value of financial assets and liabilities.
Fair value hierarchyAs at 31 December 2017. the Group held certain financial instruments measured at fair value,
===================================================
126.hocr: 
Millennium a Copthorne Hotels plcStrategic Report Governance Financial statements Further information Annuat Report 51 Accounts 2017
The Group uses the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments by valuation technique:Level1: quoted (Unadiusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
Leve12: other techniques for which all inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value are observable. either directly orindirectly
Level 3: techniques that use inputs which have a significant effect on the recorded fair value that are not based on obsen/able market data
During the year ended 31 December 2017 there were no transfers between Level1 and Level 2 fair value measurements. and no transfersinto and out of Level 3 fair value measures.
Capital ma nagement
The Board's policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor. creditor and market confidence and to sustain futuredevelopment of the business. The Company's obiective for managing its capital is to ensure that Group entities will be able to continue as agoing concern while maximising the return to shareholders. as well as sustaining the future development of its business. In order to maintainor adjust the capital structure. the Group may alter the total amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issuenew shares, draw down additional debt or reduce debt.
The Group's capital structure consists of debt, which includes the loans and borrowings disclosed in Note 21, cash and cash equivalentsdisclosed in Note 20 and the equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings. as disclosed in theconsolidated statement of changes in equity. The Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possiblewith higher levels of borrowings and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
One of the Group's subsidiaries, CDLHT which is a stapled group comprising CDL Hospitality Real Estate Investment Trust (H-REIT) 0ndCDL Hospitality Business Trust (HBT). a business trust. is required to maintain certain minimum base capital and financial resources.
H-REIT is subiect to the aggregate leverage limit as defined in the Property Fund Appendix of the Code on Collective Investment Schemes(“C15 Code) issued by Monetan/ Authority of Singapore. The CIS Code stipulates that the total borrowings and deferred payments (togetherthe “Aggregate Leverage) of a property fund should not exceed 45.0% of its Deposited Property except that the Aggregate Leverage of aproperty fund may exceed 45.0% of its Deposited Property (Up to a maximum of 60.0%) if a credit rating of the property fund from Fitch Inc‘.Moody‘s or Standard and Poor's is obtained and disclosed to the public. The property fund should continue to maintain and disclose acredit rating 50 long as its Aggregate Leverage exceeds 45.0% of its Deposited Property
For this financial year‘ H-REIT has a credit rating of 835- from Fitch Inc. The Aggregate Leverage of H»REIT as at 31 December 2017 was32.6% (2016: 36.6%) of H-REIT's Deposited Property. This complied with the aggregate leverage limit as described above.
HBT. H-REIT and CDLHT have complied with the borrowing limit requirements imposed by the relevant Trust Deeds and all externaliyimposed capital requirements for the financial years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016.

Pension arrangementsThe Group operates various funded pension schemes which are established in accordance with local conditions and practices within the
countries concerned The most significant funds are described below.
United KingdomThe pension arrangements in the United Kingdom operate under the Millennium a Copthorne Pension Plan’, which was set up in 1993. The
plan operates a funded defined benefit arrangement together with a defined contribution plan. both with different categories ofmembership The defined benefit section of the plan was closed to new entrants in 2001 and at the some time rights to a guaranteedminimum pension (6MP) Under the defined contribution scheme also ceased. The plcln entitles a retired employee to receive an annualpension payment.
The contributions required are determined by a qualified actuary on the basis of triennial valuations using the proiected unit credit method.The last full actuarial valuation of this scheme was carried out by a qualified independent actuary as at 5 April 2017 and this has beenupdated on an approximate basis to 31 December 2017. The contributions of the Group during the year were 24% (2016: 24%) ofpensionable salary.
As the defined benefit section is closed to new entrants. the current service cost, as a percentage of pensionable payroll is likely to increaseas the membership ages. although it will be applied to a decreasing pensionable payroll. The assumptions which have the most significanteffect on the results of the valuation are those relating to the discount rate and the rates of increase in salaries and pensions.
South Korea
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in South Korea. The contributions required are determined by anexternal qualified actuary using the proiected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2017. Theassumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of the valuations are those relating to the discount rate and rate ofincrease in salaries.
Taiwan
The Group operates a defined benefit pension plan for its employees in Taiwan. The contributions required are determined by on externalqualified actuary using the projected unit credit method. The most recent valuation was carried out on 31 December 2017. The contributionsof the Group were 6% (2016: 6%) of the employees' earnings. The assumptions which have the most significant effect on the results of thevaluations are those relating to the discount rate and rate of increase in salaries.
The defined benefit plans are administered by pension funds that are legally separated from the Group. The boards of the pension fundsare required by law to act in the best interests of the plan participants.
These defined benefit pions expose the Group to actuarial risks, such as longevity risk. currency risk. interest rate risk and market investmentrisk.
The above plans are substantially funded by the Group's subsidiaries. The funding requirements are based on the pension funds' actuarialmeasurement framework set out in the funding policies of the plans.

The assets of each scheme have been taken at market value and the liabilities have been calculated using the following principalassumptions:

The assumptions used by the actuaries are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions, which due to thetimescale covered, may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The present values of the schemes' liabilities are derived from cash flowproiections over long periods and are inherently uncertain.
Reasonably possible changes at the reporting date to one of the relevant actuarial assumptions. holding other assumptions consistent.would have altered the defined benefit obligation by the amounts shown below:
Discount rate (1% movement) (14) 14 m) 11Rate of salary increase (1% movement) 2 (2) 2 (2)

Although the analysis does not take account of the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plans, it does provide anapproximation of the sensitivity of the assumptions shown.

In the reporting period, absolute emissionsincreased by 15% compared to last yeardue to an increase in the number of wasteemission sources on which we now report.Previously reported emissions data werelimited to waste sent to landﬁll, however
in line with GHG protocol reportingrecommendations made this year, we
have reported all emissions from wastemanagement processes including recyclingand compost waste, together with emissionlosses from T&D and WTT (emissionsassociated with the extraction, generationand transport of fuels used). As a result ofthis, emissions per room has increased by17% to 11.13 tonnes of COQe/room.
If we were to exclude WTT and T&Demission losses, our absolute emissionstotal would have decreased by 4%compared to last year.
Waste and resource use
Increasing waste diverted from landﬁllremains a key focus of our sustainability[ourney. By sharing best practice andinnovative ideas among our hotels, wastereduction and recycling initiatives have

been spread to a large extent across ourportfolio.
Our London hotels continue to workclosely with our UK waste contractor toimprove the recycle facilities in the back
of house areas and conference rooms.
For example, glass bottles for drinkingwater are provided in the guest rooms andfunction rooms. thereby eliminating the useof their plastic counterparts. By introducingthis system. we signiﬁcantly reduce theamount of plastic waste that would begenerated as well as reducing the carbonemissions associated with the production,transportation and recycling of plasticwater bottles.
Waste data
For 2017 the reported volume of wasteincreased by 39.97% on an absolute basisand by 44% on a per room basis comparedto last year largely due to a change in
how we report our waste. This year wheredata on recycling is unavailable, we haveassumed that all such waste is landﬁlled.so that we account for the highest possibleimpact on our emissions. This has resultedin an increase in the amount of wastedeﬁned as landﬁlled but also gives us
the opportunity to work on improving thequality of this data for future reporting.

Therelevant period over which the Board is toassess the viability of the Company must belonger than 12 months. and in this case theBoard has selected a three year period‘
A three year assessment period wasconsidered by the Directors to beappropriate for several reasons:
' First. the three-yeor period is in linewith the Group's rolling ﬁnancialand capital expenditure planning.particularly as many of the Group'sﬁnancing facilities have three-yeormaturities.

. In accordance with provision (:22 of the UK Corporate Governance Code, the Directors have carried out a robust assessmentof the principal risks facing the Group, including combinations of those that would threaten its business model, futureperformance, solvency or liquidity. This assessment involved a review of the prospects of the Group over the three year periodto 31 December 2020 taking into account the Group's assets, strategy and the Group‘s principal risks and how these aremanaged over this time period, as detailed above.
- The Directors believe the three year period to be appropriate for the reasons stated above. The annual budget and plan andthree yearf'inancial and capital expenditure proiections are supported by regular Board brieﬁngs provided by managementand the discussion of any new initiatives Undertaken by the Board in its normal course of business.

would be difﬁcult to form a reasonable iudgment of how the online marketplace will evolve beyond a period of three years.0 Finally, market data, used to develop rate and other proiections, beyond three years is thought to be less reliable.
Viability assessment
In order to assess the viability of the Group over the three year period. the Directors evaluated both the 2016 budget and plan, which isreviewed and approved by the Board, and three year ﬁnancial and capitalexpenditure proiections. The budget and these proiectionswere prepared taking into account the Group's strategy and the current market conditions They also took into account the principalrisks. and the controls in place to mitigate those risks, and the proiections included a sensitivity analysis based on Cl signiﬁcant declinein hotel proﬁt due to a combination of those risks. such as the failure of the Group to renew its ﬁnancing facilities, materialising for asustained period.
Having assessed the principal risks. the Directors have determined that they have a reasonable expectation that the Company will beable to continue in operation and meets its liabilities as they fall due for a period of three years to 31 December 2020.

Consistent delivery of service and product quaiity is vitallyimportant to creating and maintaining brand loyalty andvciue perception and inﬂuencing consumer preference. Thisis enhanced by the growing inﬂuence of customer ratings,reviews and the power of social media. Luck of investmentin the Group's assets or the removal of a signiﬁcant numberof rooms from inventory in order to compiete neededrefurbishment programmes could have a signiﬁcant impacton those factors and therefore on the revenues that hotels areable to achieve As supply increases. particularly in our keygateway cities, business may be lost to newer hotets und/orrates may have to be reduced to remain competitive.
in addition, management of third-party owned hotels undermanagement agreements, particularly in the Middle East andChina regions, and the use of tointventures in certain marketsgives rise to the risk of non-performance on the part of thehotel owners and ioint venture partners, affecting the abitityof the relevant hoteis to deliver service and product qualityconsistent with the Group brand and operating standards,especially when the strategic obiectives of those parties arenot aiways aiigned with those of the Group.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE STATEM ENT
Dear Shareholders.
As | remarked in last year's CorporateGovernance Statement. an effectivegovernance regime must be practical andtailored to the needs of each business. Itcannot exist in a vacuum. but instead mustevolve and help support the growth ofthe business. That is why over the courseof 2017 we implemented changes to thecomposition of our Board to help refresh.and enhance the skills and experience of,our Directors.
This was a year of change an the BoardWith Aloysius Lee, Alexander Waugh andNicholas George stepping down from theBoard during the ﬁrst half of the year, wewere pleased to welcome Martin Leitchto the Board in May 2017 and Christian deCharnacé in August 2017. Both Christianand Martin have a proven track recordof delivering results and bring a wealthof experience to the Board. As previouslyreported, Howard Wu, who ioined theBoard in February 2017. stepped down inAugust 2017 to lead our US. operationsand our global information technologydepartment as part of our executivemanagement team.
These retirements and appointmentscreated an opportunity for us to examineand adiust the membership of our Boardcommittees, Susan Farr and Martin Leitchwere appointed to chair the RemunerationCommittee and Audit Committee,respectively. taking over from AlexanderWaugh and Gervase MacGregor. MrMacGregor took on the chair of the RiskCommittee in place of Mr Kwek Leng Peck,and His Excellency Shaukat Aziz assumedthe role of Senior Independent Directorafter Nicholas George stepped down.Christian de Charnacé was appointed asa member of the Audit Committee effective23 March 2016.
In 2018 I will work with the Directorsto ensure that we continue to focus onthe challenges we face. both internally
and externally. and that the Board andGroup have the proper mix of talent andresources to allow the Company to executeits strategy and develop the business
over the coming years, New Directorappointments may be considered as partof this proposal.
This year we conducted an internal Boardevaluation which supported the ﬁndingsof the external Board evaluation whichwas conducted in 2016 and we found thatthe Board is collegiate, transparent andeffective. A summary of the key ﬁndingsfrom the internal board evaluation is
set out on page 46 of the CorporateGovernance Statement.
Given the geopolitical events we areexperiencing around the world. such
as the tensions in Korea and proposedwithdrawal of the UK. from the EuropeanUnion in 2019. and other challenges facingthe Group, including the performance ofour New York hotels and increasing marketshare of ontine travel agencies, the Boardand management team have spent aconsiderable amount of time consideringthe possible effects these will have on ourbusiness and will continue to keep thesematters under review and assess ways
in which their impacts can be mitigated.lbelieve that our entrepreneurial andinnovative culture will help the Companybecome more resilient and tackle thesechallenges in 2018 and beyond.
On 9th October 2017 an announcementwas made in respect of a possible offer byAgapier Investments Limited. a companyindirectly and wholly-owned by CityDevelopments Limited (CDL). fortheentire issued and to be issued ordinaryshare capital of the Company not alreadyheld by CDL and its subsidiaries (andpersons acting in concert with them)
(the Possible Offer). it was disclosedthat prior to this announcement anIndependent Committee comprising of all
the Independent Non-Executive Directorshad been set up to assess the merits ofthe approach from CDL After the PossibleOffer was announced. the IndependentCommittee received a wide range offeedback from minority shareholders,
held constructive dialogue with CDL andcontinued to carefully consider the meritsof the transaction. Following continuedengagement between the parties, on 6December 2017. a further announcementwas made indicating that CDL and theIndependent Committee had reachedagreement on the terms of an increasedrecommended ﬁnal offer of 600 pence pershare, in cash. together with an increasedspecial dividend of 20 pence per share.The process concluded on 26 January 2015,when CDL conﬁrmed that the possible offerhad lapsed.
The Board therefore has recommencedexamining its strategic priorities whilsttaking into consideration the detailedshareholder feedback that was receivedduring and afterthe offer period. TheBoard has determined that the followingare some of the key areas of focus for theGroup. among others:
' Succession planning for the Board andCommittee membership, the GroupChief Executive Ofﬁcer and seniormanagement
0 The dedication of more time toreviewing and setting the high-levelstrategy and priorities for the Group
- Increased capital investment totransform and reposition the Group'shotel estate
0 Further investment into andenhancement of the Company'swebsite, e-commerce capabilities,loyalty programmes and its digitalstrategy overall, with a particular focuson business»to»business initiatives

' Strengthening the senior managementteam in the US and elsewhere
' Development of a more comprehensivestrategy to deal with the possibleeffects of the UK leaving the EuropeanUnion
. The restructuring of key functions, suchas the Group's global sales team, tohelp drive the business forward
Over the coming year, the Board will seekto devise a more detailed strategy for theCompany's short and long-term priorities.
Board and senior management successionare key considerations for the Board.Succession planning is essential to helpminimise or avoid instability and ensurean appropriate level of quality within theBoard and management team. Followingthe retirement of Aloysius Lee at the
end of February 2017. the NominationsCommittee, together with the Board,identified that Mr Tan Kian Seng, who ﬁrst[oined the Group as Chief of Staff andinterim President of Asia in October 2016.would be an ideal successor to Mr Lee.
Mr Tan was appointed to the role of interimGroup Chief Executive Ofﬁcer with effectfrom March 2017 and with the support ofthe Board set to task in reshaping andstrengthening the senior managementteam. A number of key appointments weremade in order to address some of the
skill gaps within the team and challengesfacing the Group. More information onthe key appointments made to date isavailable on page 67 of the NominationsCommittee Report.
With Mr Tan serving as the interim GroupChief Executive Ofﬁcer since March
2017, the Board has been mindfulof theneed to appoint a permanent successorbalanced against the need to ﬁnd theright candidate, with the best skills andexperience to take the Company forward.The search continued through the ﬁrst

half of the year and was put on holdpending the outcome of the offer by CDL.With the offer having lapsed in January2018. the Board has determined thatﬁlling the role on a permanent basis willbe a key consideration in 2016, althoughthe Directors remain conﬁdent that themanagement of the Group is in safehands with Mr Tan in his interim role in themeantime
The Board believes that it is important tohave an appropriate balance of skills,experience, knowledge and backgroundson the Board and at the seniormanagement level. This is vital to enabledifferent perspectives to be brought toBoard and committee discussions. Weare mindful of the recommendationsmade by Lord Davies and his Women
on Boards Report, which initially statedthat there should be at least 25% femalerepresentation on the Boards of FTSE 350listed companies, but which subsequentlyhas been revised to recommend that one-third of the members of boards of FTSE350 companies be comprised of femalesby 2020. The Nominations Committeeacknowledges that there is further workto be done in respect of increasinggender diversity on the Board and thisremains an on-gaing priority for theNominations Committee and the Board.Further information on the Group's diversityefforts is contained on page 70 of theNominations Committee Reports
In 2016 the Group established a dedicatedRisk Committee to carry out a robustassessment of the principal risks facing
the Company. including those that
would threaten its business model, futureperformance and solvency. In 2017 themain obiectives of the Risk Committee wereto build on the work completed in 2016 andalso to continue developing a more robustGroup risk management framework. Thisincluded a comprehensive review and
Millennium a Copthorne Hotels plcAnnual Report 51 Accounts 2017
assessment of the Group's principal risksand the development of a risk frameworkbelow those risks. at the regional.functional and hotel levels. This work isfurther described in the ”Our risks sectionon page 23.
Despite all of the Change and activityduring the year, I am pleased to say
that the Board has determined that theCompany has complied with the provisionsof the UK Corporate Governance Code in2017, as further detailed in this CorporateGovernance Statement.
I would like to thank the Directors fortheir diligent efforts over the course ofthe year. particularly as they had to takeon additional responsibilities and timecommitments in connection with thetakeover offers As we get ready to headinto the second half of 2015, we remainfocused and ready to make difﬁcultdecisions in order to turn around theGroup's US. and Singapore regions andpush the performance of our global hotelportfolio.

Foreign exchange gains relating tohotel revenue totalled £39m arising fromweaker sterling, which is our reportingcurrency, against currencies in theregions where we operate. The increasein 2017 hotel revenue was attributablemainly to a full year of trading at twa ofour hotels: Millennium Hilton New YorkOne UN Plaza, which re-opened post-refurbishment in September 2016, andGrand Millennium Auckland, which joinedthe Group in September 2016.

DIRECTORS' REIVIUNERATION REPORT
Annual chairman’s statement
Dear Shareholders.
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee) did not considerany signiﬁcant remuneration issues for Directors in 2017. as theCompany had no Executive Directors during the year apart
from Aloysius Lee, who retired from the Board and as GroupChief Executive Ofﬁcer on 26 February 2017. Consideration of
the executive elements of the Remuneration Policy thereforerelated to the structure within which any new Executive Directorappointments would be made rather than to their application toexisting Executive Directors.
As set out in the 2016 Annual Report 8 Accounts, the Committeeconducted a detailed review of its Directors' Remuneration Policyin 2016 and modiﬁed and enhanced the policy in line with manybest practice guidelines. lam pleased to report that the revisedRemuneration Policy was approved by shareholders at the AnnualGeneral Meeting held on 5 May 2017 (and will expire at theAnnual General Meeting to be held in 2020). with 94.6% of votesfor the resolution and 5.4% against. No further changes weremade to the policy in 2017 nor are any being proposed.
It is the Committee's intention to develop within the Company agreater culture of performance related reward. The Committeerecognises the importance of reward differential as a tool thatcan be used to help improve business performance and ensurethat the appraisal and rating of employees takes place acrossall regions and levels. This in turn will have beneﬁts on, amongstotherthings. employee retention and motivation.
The primary matters considered by the Committee in respect otthe 2017 ﬁnancial year were, in summary:
Retirement of the Group Chief Executive Officer
In coniunction with the retirement of Aloysius Lee at the end ofFebruary 2017, the Committee determined the bonus to be paid toMr Lee in respect of his 2016 performance. as reported in the 2016Annual Report 8 Accounts. To recap his leaving arrangements,he received his salary, allowances and cash pension contributionthrough the end ofJanuary 2017, and no bonus was or will be paidin relation to 2017. With regard to Mr Lee's Long Term IncentivePlan awards over134.406 shares (awarded in 2015) and 165.643shares (awarded in 2016), the Committee determined that theseawards would vest on their normal vesting dates subject to therelevant agreed performance conditions, time pro-rating and therules of the scheme.
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)No awards were made Underthe LTIP in 2017. The only
outstanding awards Underthe LTIP are those made in 2015 and2016.
With regard to the 2015 LTIP awards. the Committee reviewedthe Company's achievement against the performance measures.including total shareholder return (assessed against the FTSE250, excluding investment companies, and a hospitality peergroup), growth of the Company's net asset value and dividends,and cumulative earnings per share for the three-year periodended 31 December 2017, The Committee determined that theCompany did not meet the required minimum thresholds and thataccordingly the awards will lapse in full in August 2016.
Review of the External Adviser to the Committee
During 2017 the Committee conducted through a tender
process a review of its remuneration adviser and selectedPricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as its next adviser. Further details ofthat review are set out on page 63 of this report.
Offer
During the year. an offer was made by Agapier InvestmentsLimited, a company indirectly and wholly-owned by CityDevelopments Limited (“CDL”), forthe entire issued and to beissued ordinary share capital of the Company not already heldby CDL and its subsidiaries (and persons acting in concert withthem). A ﬁnal offer was announced on 8 December 2017. TheCommittee as part of an assessment of the ﬁnal offer consideredcarefully how existing share awards should be treated in the eventthat the offer were to proceed though the offer subsequentlylapsed on 26 January 2016. The offer obviously createdconsiderable uncertainty during the year and not a climate, inrelation to remuneration. for new developments.
In closing, I would like to thank my predecessor as Chair of theRemuneration Committee, Alexander Waugh, for his outstandingcontribution to the work of the Committee as a member since 2010and as its Chair since 2011. I also would like to thank His ExcellencyShaukat Aziz. Daniel Desbaillets. Gervase MacGregor andNicholas George for their contributions to the Committee's workoverthe past year.
The remainder of this Directors Remuneration Report has beenprepared in compliance with applicable reporting requirementsand I hope you ﬁnd it useful. The Committee welcomes anyfeedback from our shareholders.
Yours faithfully.

The 2016 Annual Report and Accounts described the annual performance bonus criteria for Aloysius Lee, the only Executive Directorwho served in 2016. It was divided into two components, ﬁnancial performance measures, which represented 60% of the bonusOpportunity. and personal key performance indicators, which represented 40% of the bonus opportunity. The 2016 Annual Report
8 Accounts reported that, in relation to the ﬁnancial performance measures, one target was based on Group Revenue (with a 10%weighting), and the other Group Proﬁt Before Tax (with a 50% weighting). However. the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts did not showthe speciﬁc ﬁnancial targets for Aloysius Lee's ﬁnancial performance measures due to their commercial sensitivity. The Committee hasnow determined that the speciﬁc ﬁnancial targets are no longer commercially sensitive, and as such the ﬁnancial performance targetsand achievements for Mr Lee's annual bonus for the year ended 31 December 2016 are set out below.

This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement the Remuneration Policy in 2010.
Remuneration of Any Executive Directors to be appointed in 2018
The Committee expects that any recruitment beneﬁts or compensation and the salary, bonus and share scheme arrangements. andpension and other beneﬁts to be provided to any new Executive Director appointed during 2018 will be in line with the Directors'Remuneration Policy last approved by the Company's shareholders. as disclosed in the 2016 Annual Report and Accounts.
As disclosed in the Nominations Committee report, the recruitment of a permanent Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer was put on hold inAugust 2017 pending the results of the possible offer, and subsequent ﬁnal offer, from CDL. As discussed earlier in the report the offerlapsed on 26January 2018.
In the event a new Executive Director is to be appointed in 2016. the Committee will be mindful of the guidance set out in the InvestmentAssociation Principles of Remuneration that the use of additional holding periods for performance share awards is now commonlyexpected by investors, so that in totalthe performance and holding period should cover a period of at least ﬁve years. In addition, theCommittee anticipates working with its remuneration advisor to develop a more tailored and ﬁt-for»purpose remuneration package forany permanent Group Chief Executive Ofﬁcer or other Executive Director to be appointed, which may include the use of a post-vestingholding period in the LTIP. and the deferral of a portion of any cash payments Under the Company's short-term incentive bonus plan.The Committee believes that these measures could assist in further aligning the interests of Executive Directors with the interests of theCompany‘s shareholders, and therefore help drive continued long-term value creation.
Non-Executive Director fees
Payments to Non-Executive Directors will be in accordance with the current Directors' Remuneration Policy. Non-Executive Directorstherefore will continue to receive a basic fee for Board membership and separate annual fees for their service as a member and, to theextent applicable. the Chair of a Board committee. The Senior Independent Director will be paid an additional fee, currently of £10,000per year. to serve in such capacity. Details of the current additional committee and chair fees are set out in the table below and noChanges are being proposed for 2018:
Audit Committee £5,000 £10,000Remuneration Committee £5,000 £10,000Nominations Committee £2,000 -Risk Committee 123.000 25.000

The Chairman of the Board will receive a set fee determined by the Committee from time to time. The current annual fee is £250,000and will remain the same in 2016. The Chairman also may continue to receive additional fees for serving as a director of certainsubsidiary companies.

* includes discretionary votes
The Company understands that a small number of shareholders would have preferred a mandatory post-vesting holding period to beincluded in the LTIP. As a result. and as noted earlier in this report. the Committee will consider including this feature in the packageoffered to new Executive Directors.
Consideration by the Committee members of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
The Committee is authorised by the Board to appoint external advisers if it considers such an appointment to be beneﬁcial. TheCommittee decided in December 2016 that it should carry out a tender process for the appointment of the Committee's remunerationadviser as a matter of good practice given that the incumbent. Mercer Kepler. had been in role for ﬁve years.
The Committee conducted a comprehensive tender and selection process during which the Committee invited ﬁve ﬁrms (including theincumbent) to submit written proposals. Four of those ﬁrms were then shortlisted and made presentations to the Committee. At the endof that process, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PWC) were selected as the Committee's new remuneration adviser, with effect from 1December 2017. Consultants from PwC then commenced Cl transition exercise and attended the Remuneration Committee meeting of 14December 2017: before then consultants from Mercer Kepler attended most of the Committee's other meetings in 2017.

DIRECTORS’ REIVIUNERATION REPORT
The D53 is the deferred element of the Group's annual bonus plan, Awards of conditional shares are made to senior employees. but notto those who participate in the ESP, and are calculated based on a percentage of a participant's bonus earned for the previous year.Awards also are subiect to malus and clawback provisions under the rules of the DSB.
In June 2017 awards were made to 59 employees over 55.750 shares and vest as to 25% after one year, 25% after two years and the ﬁnal50% after three years. subject to continued employment and the rules of the scheme.
Satisfaction of performance share awards

NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE REPORT
Chairman’s StatementDear Shareholders.
I am pleased to present the Company'sNominations Committee Report for2017. This report provides a summary ofthe Committee's responsibilities and itsactivities throughout the year.
During the year the focus of the Committeewas on Board and committee composition.the role of the Group Chief ExecutiveOfﬁcer. which currently is ﬁlled by Mr TanKian Seng as the Company's interim GroupChief Executive Ofﬁcer. and the successionof senior individuals within the business.
The progress made in these areas isoutlined below and it is worth notingthat the Committee also is committed toembedding inclusion and diversity at theBoard and executive levels and generallythroughout the Group. These efforts willcontinue to be a focus of the Committeeand Board going forward.
This was a signiﬁcant year of change onthe Board. With Aloysius Lee. AlexanderWaugh and Nicholas George steppingdown from the Board during the ﬁrst halfof the year, those retirements created anopportunity to refresh the composition ofthe Board and its committees. The ﬁrst newappointment during the year was HowardWu. in February 2017. Given Howard'sbackground and experience, it becameclear that he could best support the Groupin an executive capacity. On 5 May 2017 weannounced that he would be leading theGroup's information technology functionand he has since taken on leadership ofthe Company's North American operations
as its President. He stepped down from theBoard on 3 August 2017.
In addition to Howard‘s appointment. theCommittee identiﬁed and recommendedtwo additional appointments to the Board.Martin Leitch and Christian de Charnacé,who ioined the Board in May 2017 and
August 2017. respectively. Martin hasvaluable corporate ﬁnance experiencein the UK. whilst Christian brings deepinternationalﬁnancial and investmentbanking experience to the Board.Biographies of these new directors areavailable on page 33.
As a result of these retirements and newappointments. the Committee consideredsuccession planning within, and changesto. the Board's committees. First. HisExcellency Shaukat Aziz succeededNicholas George as the Company's SeniorIndependent Director as from 5 May 2017.Given his experience and knowledge ofthe Company, his appointment helped
to bring continuity to the role. Second.Susan Farr was appointed as Chair of theRemuneration Committee and GervaseMacGregor was appointed Chair of theRisk Committee. also with effect from 5May 2017. Both Directors had served onand meaningfully participated in eachrespective committee prior to taking ontheir new chair responsibilities. MartinLeitch assumed the role of Chair of theAudit Committee on 4 August 2017. FinallyChristian de Charnacé was appointed asa member of the Audit Committee effective23 March 2016.
Additional changes were made asannounced throughout the year and theCommittee will continue to keep Underreview the composition of the Board andits committees and may consider newappointments as and when appropriate.
Following the retirement of Aloysius Lee atthe end of February 2017, the Committee.together with the wider Board. took timeto consider the role of the Group ChiefExecutive Ofﬁcer. Mr Tan Kian Seng, whoﬁrst ioined the Group as Chief of Staffand interim President of Asia in October2016. was elevated to serve as the interimGroup CEO from March 2017. and hasproven to be competent and a safe pair
of hands as we work to ﬁll the skills gapsin our regional and functional leadershipteams.
Whilst the Board believes that theappointment of a permanent ChiefExecutive Ofﬁcer is vitally important
for the Group. given the need and
time required to ﬁnd an appropriatecandidate. it was critical to address theoperational and other issues impactingour operations in the US... New York inparticular. Singapore and elsewhere asa matter of priority. However. recruitmentfor the role was put on hold in August2017 following the approach by AgapierInvestments Limited, a wholly ownedsubsidiary of City Developments Limited(“CDL”), with regard to a possible cashofferto acquire all of the remaining sharesin the Company not then held by CDL orparties acting in concert with it. With thelapse of the ﬁnal offer in January 2016,the Committee has once again picked upthis baton and recommenced the searchprocess.
As described above. one of the obiectivesassigned to Kian Seng, with the supportof the Committee and the Board, was toreview the senior leadership team andmanagement structure and engageappropriate talent where necessary. tohelp put in place the foundation thatwould allow the Group to tackle thevarious challenges it faces and drive thebusiness to the next level. This reviewhas resulted in. among otherthings, theappointments of a new President of theU.S., a new President of UK/Europe. anew Chief Technology and SolutionsOfﬁcer. a new Chief Marketing Ofﬁcerand a new GlobalSenior Vice Presidentof Human Resources. The former head ofoperations for Europe, who had been withthe Company for many years, took on anewly created role of Chief CommercialOfﬁcer and has been busy reorganisingthe Group's global sales function.

It is along these lines thatthe Committee will be rigorously assessingMr Aziz's appointment around his ninthanniversary.
None of the other Independent Non»Executive Directors will reach nine years intenure in 20162

The risk
Subiective valuation
The Gmup’s hotel assets are subiect to an annual review to assess
whether or notthey may be impaired,
The Group ﬁrst identiﬁes the hotet assets where there is anindication of impairment. These assets, are then subiected todetailed impairment review with reference to either currentexternat valuations or internal trading updates from the mostrecentty available external valuation,
Certain hotel assets were considered at risk of impairment due tobeing subiect to impairment in previous years (and therefore anydecline in performance may result in a further impairment beingrecorded) or because the Group has experienced a difﬁcuittrading environment in 2017, particulariy in the US and Asia.
External valuations are generalty performed on a third partyoperator basis. This assesses the value of the hotel on the samebasis that an 'efﬁcient operator' market participant would andtherefore assesses the net cash ﬂows that an efﬁcient operatorbelieves it could achieve.
This analysis is subiective due to the inherent uncertainty invoivedin determining appropriate assumptions such as expected freecash ﬂows and future market growth, terminal rate and discountrates. Therefore, the review and chalienge ofthese assumptionsis one ofthe key iudgmental areas that ouraudit is concentratedon.
Our respon se
Assessing values’ credentials: we assessed the independence.professional qualiﬁcations, competence and experience of theexternal Valuers used by the Group,
Test of details: we challenged the Group's assessment of

Materiality for the Group ﬁnancialstatements as a whole was set at £7.0m(2016: £7.0m)‘ determined with referenceto a benchmark of group proﬁt before
tax normalised to exclude impairment onhotel assets and revaluation adiustmentson investment properties as disclosed innote 12 and14, of which it represents 40%(2016: 45%). These items are excluded dueto their volatility.
Materiality for the parent com panyﬁnancial statements as a whole was set
at £6.7m (2016: 7.0m). This is lower than
the materiality we would otherwise havedetermined by reference to net assets, andrepresents 0.46% of the Company’s netassets (2016: 0.52%).
We agreed to report to the AuditCommittee any corrected or uncorrectedidentiﬁed misstatements exceeding£0.35m. in addition to other identiﬁedmisstatements that warranted reporting onqualitative grounds.

The consolidatedfinancial statements of the Group forthe year ended 31 December 2017 were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of theDirectors on 25 March 2015.
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for investment properties and, from 1 January 2005,derivative financial instruments, financial instruments held for trading and financial instruments classified as available-for-sale which arestated at theirfair values. Hotel properties are stated at cost or deemed cost. Deemed cost is calculated based on the hotel's frozenvaluation as at 1 January 2004. Non-current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.The Group's income statement and segmental analysis separately identifies operating proﬁt and other operating income and expense. Thisis in accordance with IASi ‘Presentation of Financial Statements and is consistent with the way that financial performance is measured bymanagement and assists in providing a meaningful analysis of the trading results of the Group. The financial statements are presented inthe Company's functional currency of sterling, rounded to the nearest million.
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with Financial Reporting Standard 10]'Reduced Disclosure Fromework'.
Basis of accountingThese consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as required by EU law (IAS RegulationEC1606/2002). Details of the Group's accounting policies, including changes during the year, are included below.
Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to. or has rights to, variable returns fromits involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial statements ofsubsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences Until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Interests in equity-accounted investeesThe Group's interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in ioint ventures and associates.
An associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence but not control or joint control, over the financial and operatingpolicies. A ioint venture is an arrangement in which the Group has [oint control, and where the Group has rights to the net assets of thearrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obligations for its liabilities,
Interests in ioint ventures and associates are accounted for using the equity method. They are initially recognised at cost. which includestransaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the consolidated fina ncial statements include the Grou p's share of the profit or loss andother comprehensive income of equity-accounted investees, Until the date on which significant influence or ioint control ceases.
(iii) Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated.Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equity—occounted investees are eliminated against the investment to the extent of theGroup's interest in the investee. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains. but only to the extent that there is noevidence of impairment.
Going concern
The Group's business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development. performance and position are set out in theStrategic Report on pages 4 to 30. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows. liquidity position and borrowing facilities aredescribed in the Strategic Report — Financial performance on pages 10 to 11 and in the key performance indicators on page 9‘ In addition,

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Note 22 of the financial statements includes the Group's obiectives, policies and processes for managing its capital: its financial riskmanagement obiectives: details of its financial instruments and hedging activities: and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk. TheGroup has considerable financial resources and plans for refinancing maturing facilities are under way.
Cash flow forecasts for the Group have been prepared for a period in excess of twelve months from the date of approval of theseconsolidated financial statements. These forecasts reflect an assessment of current market conditions. The forecasts completed on this basisshow that the Group will be able to operate within the current committed debt facilities and show continued compliance with the financialcovenants. In addition, management has considered various mitigating actions that could be taken in the event that market conditions areworse than their current assessment. Such measures include further reduction in costs and in capital expenditure. On the basis of theexercise as described above and the available committed debt facilities, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group andCompany have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least12 months from the signing of this annual report.Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements of the Group and the Company.
In assessing whether the Group is a going concern, the Directors failow a review process which is consistent with the principles set out in the“Guidance on Risk Management, Internal Controland Related Financial and Business Reporting 2014 published by the Financial ReportingCouncil.
The Group has consistently applied the following accounting policies to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.
A Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost of an acquisition is measured as the aggregate of theconsideration transferred, measured at acquisition date fairvalue and the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree. For eachbusiness combination. the acquirer measures the non-Controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair vaiue or at the proportionate share ofthe acquiree's identifiable net assets. Acquisition costs incurred are expensed and identifiable net assets acquired are measured at theacquisition date fair value.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financiat assets and liabilities assumed for appropriate classification and designationin accordance with the contractual terms. economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes theseparation of embedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquires.
If the business combination is achieved in stages. the acquisition date fair value of the acquirer's previously held equity interest in theacquiree is remeasured to fair value as at that date through the income statement.
Any contingent consideration is measured at fairvalue at the date of acquisition. If an obligation to pay contingent consideration thatmeets the definition of a financial instrument is classified as equity, then it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity.Otherwise, other contingent consideration is remeasured at fair value at each reporting date and subsequent changes in the fair value ofthe contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the consideration transferred over the fair value of the Group‘s net identifiableassets acquired and liabilities assumed. and is allocated to each of the Group's hotels that are expected to benefit from the combination. Ifthe consideration is lower than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired. the difference is recognised in the incomestatement
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. For the purpose of impairment testing,goodwill acquired in a business combination is. from the acquisition date. allocated to each of the Group's cash-generating units that areexpected to benefit from the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash»generating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of. the goodwillassociated with the disposed operation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal.

Goodwitl disposed in these circumstances is measured based on the relative vaiues of the disposed operation and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
B Foreign currencyThe financial statements of each of the Group's businesses are prepared in the functional currency applicable to that business.
(i) Foreign currency translationTransactions in foreign currencies other than the functional currency are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of thetransaction.
Monetaw assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated into sterling at the foreignexchange rate at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetaryassets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated at the date of the transaction.Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated into sterling at foreignexchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined
(ii) Financial statements of foreign operations
On consolidation. the assets and Liabilities of foreign operations, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation. are translated tosterting at foreign exchange rates ruiing at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated tosteriing at rates approximating to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions.

C Derivative ﬁnancial instrumentsThe Group holds derivative financial instruments to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate risk exposures. Embedded derivatives areseparated from the host contract and accounted for separately if certain criteria are met.
Derivatives are initially measured at fair value; any directly attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred.Subsequent to initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value, and changes therein are generally recognised in profit or loss.
D Hedges
(i) Cash flow hedges
When a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highlyprobable transaction. the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in equity. When theforecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non—financial asset or non-financial liability. the associated cumulative gainor loss is removed from equity and included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial asset or liability. If a hedge of aforecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, then the associated gains and lossesthat were recognised directly in equity are reclassified to the income statement in the same period or periods during which the assetacquired or liability assumed affects the income statement (i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised).
For cash flow hedges. other than those covered by the above policy. the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from equity andrecognised in profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffectivepart of any gain or loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but thehedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in

(iii) Hedge of net investment in foreign operations
The portion of the gain or loss on an instrument used to hedge a net investment in a foreign operation that is determined to be an effectivehedge is recognised directty in equity within the translation reserve. The ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the incomestatement
E Property, plant and equipment and depreciation
(i) Recognition and measurement
Land and buildings (other than investment properties) are stated at cost, except as allowed under IFRS 1 transition rules, less depreciationand any provision for impairment. All other property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less depreciation and any provision forimpairment. Any impairment of such properties below depreciated historical cost is Charged to the income statement.
Under the transition provisions of IFRS 1. land and buildings which were previously revalued Under UK GAAP were measured on the basis oftheir deemed cost, being their UK GAAP carrying value. inctuding revaluations, as at] January 2004 being the effective date of the Group'sconversion to IFRS.
(ii) DepreciationFreehold land is not depreciated. All other assets are depreciated to their residual values on c: straight-line basis over their estimated usefullives as follows:

F Leases
(i) Leased assetsLeases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. The leased asset is
initially recorded at the lower of fair value and the present value of minimum lease payments.
The equivalent liability, categorised as appropriate. is included within current or non-current liabilities, Assets are depreciated over theshorter of the lease term and their useful economic lives. Finance charges are allocated to accounting periods over the period of the leaseto produce constant rates of return on the outstanding balance.
Rentals payable by the Group Under operating leases are Charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease termeven if payments are not made on the same basis. In cases where rents comprise a fixed and a variable element, the fixed element only ischarged to the income statement on a straight—line basis with the variable amounts being charged as they become due Lease incentivesreceived are recognised as an integral part of the total lease expense
Rentals receivable by the Group as lessor Under operating leases, including the sub—let‘ting of retail outlets within hotel properties, arecredited to the income statement on a strcight-line basis over the lease term even if the receipts are not made on such a basis. Costs.including depreciation incurred in earning the lease income. are recognised as an expense.
(ii) Lease premium
The Group makes and receives initial payments on entering into both long and short leases of land and buildings. Where payment forleased land is equivalent to the purchase of the freehold interest. the lease is classified as a finance lease. All other payments for leases ofland are classified as operating leases.
On the statement of financial position. finance tease payment attributable to the land is recorded as property, plant and equipment and foroperating leases. the land is recorded CIS a lease premium prepayment. Both lease types are charged to the income statement on astraight-line basis over the term of the lease. Interest attributable to funds to finance the purchase or lease of land is capitalised gross of taxrelief and added to the cost of lease.
In the case of lease premiums received, these are reflected on the statement of financial position as deferred income. appropriatelyclassified between current and non-current Liabilities and are credited to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of thelease.
G Impairment
The carwing amounts of the Group's assets, other than investment properties, inventories, employee benefit assets and deferred tax assetsare reviewed at each reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists. the asset'srecoverable amount is estimated,
The recoverable amount of assets is the greater of their net selling price and value in use. In assessing value in use. the estimated futurecash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Impairment is recognised in the income statement whenever the carwing amount of an asset or its cash-generating Unit exceeds itsrecoverable amount. Impairment losses are reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverableamount. Where permissible under IFRS, an impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assets carrying amount does not exceedthe carrying amount that would have been determined. net of depreciation or amortisation. if no impairment had been recognised.
In the case of equity investments classified as available-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in fair value of the asset below its cost isconsidered in determining whether the asset is impaired. If any such evidence exists for available-for-sale financial assets. the cumuiativeloss — measured as the difference between acquisition cost and the current fair value. less any impairment loss on that financial assetpreviously recognised in the income statement — is removed from equity and recognised in the income statement

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
H Investment properties
Investment properties held by the Group are properties which are held either to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or both.Investment properties are stated at fair value. Any increase or decrease in the fair value on annual revaluation is recognised in the incomestatement in accordance with IAS 40 Investment Property. In limited circumstances, the determination of fair value is uncertain, and theseproperties are carried at cost. Impairment analysis over these properties is carried out annually.
An external independent valuer, having an appropriate recognised professional qualification and recent experience in the location andcategory of the property being valued, values the portfolio annually. The fair valves are based on market values, being the estimatedamount forwhich a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willing buyer and a willing seller in an arm's lengthtransaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion.
| InventoriesInventories are recorded at the lower of cost and net realisa ble value, Net realisa ble value is the estimated selling price in the ordinarycourse of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses.
] Development properties
Development properties are stated at the lower of cost and net reolisclble value. They are held for sale in the shortterm and are thereforeclassified as current assets. The cost of development properties includes interest and other related expenditure incurred in order to get theasset ready for its intended use, Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised. on a specificidentification basis. as part of the cost of the development property Until the completion of development. Payments received frompurchasers arising from pre-sales of the property units prior to the completion are included as deferred income Under other financialliabilities in the statement of financial position.
K Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group‘s cash management are included as a componentof cash and cash equivalents
L Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost:any difference between proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the periodof the borrowings using the effective interest method.
M Income taxIncome tax on profit or loss comprises current and deferred tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that itrelates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.

Deferred tax is provided for using the balance sheet method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assetsand liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes The following temporary differences are notprovided for: (i) the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit: and (ii) differences relating toinvestments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will proba bly not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided isbased on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, Using tax rates enacted orsubstantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is proba ble that future taxa ble profits will be availa ble against which the assetcan be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the benefit will be realised.
===================================================
94.hocr:

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset only to the extent that: (i) the Group has a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assetsagainst current tax liabilities: (ii) the Group intends to settle net: and (iii) the deferred tax assets and the deferred tax liabilities relate toincome taxes levied by the same taxation authority.
N Employee beneﬁts
(i) Deﬁned contribution plansObligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are recognised as an expense in the income statement.
(ii) Deﬁned beneﬁt plans
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension plans. As set out in Note 23. the calculation of the present value of the Group'sdefined benefit obligations at each period end is subiect to significant estimation. An appropriately qualified. independent actuary is usedto undertake this calculation. The assumptions made by the octuah/ are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarialassumptions, which due to the timescale covered may not necessarily be borne out in practice. The valuation of scheme assets is based ontheir fair value at the balance sheet date. As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short term. their values may be subiect tosignificant change before they are realised. In reviewing the work of the independent actuary. management is required to exerciseiudgement to satisfy themselves that appropriate weight has been afforded to macroeconomic factors. Details of the assumptions used areset out in Note 23.
The Group's net obligation in respect of defined benefit post-employment plans, including pension pians. is calculated separately for eachplan by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. Thatbenefit is discounted to determine its present value. and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted. The calculation is performed by aqualified actuary using the proiected Unit credit method.
When the benefits of a plan are improved, the portion of the increased benefit relating to past sewice by employees is recognisedimmediately as an expense in the income statement.
The Group recognises remeasurement gains and losses within the consolidated statement of comprehensive income in the period in whichthey occur
The Group determines the net interest expense (income) on the net defined benefit liabilities (asset) for the period by applying the discountrate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability (asset). takinginto account any changes in the net defined benefit liability (asset) during the period as a result of contributions and benefit payments. Netinterest expense and other expenses related to defined benefit plans are recognised in the income statement.
(iii) Long-term service benefits
The Group's net obligation in respect of long-term service beneﬁts, other than post-employment plans. is the amount of future benefit thatemployees have earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods. The obligation is calculated using the projected unitcredit method and is discounted to its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted.
(iv) Share-based payment transactionsThe share»based incentive schemes allow the Group's employees to acquire shares of Millennium 8 Copthorne Hotels pic,
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees for awards granted after 7 November 2002 is measured by reference to the fairvalue at the date on which they are granted. The fair value is determined by using an appropriate pricing model. further details of whichare given in Note 23.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period in which theperformance ond/or service conditions are fulfilled. The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settled transactions at each reportingdate Until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equityinstruments that will Ultimately vest. The income statement expense or credit for a period represents the movement in cumulative expenserecognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
===================================================

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
No expense is recognised for awards that do not Ultimately vest. except for equity—settled transactions where vesting is conditionat Upon amarket or non-vesting condition. which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied.provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity-settled transaction award are modified, the minimum expense recognised is the expense as if the terms hadnot been modified, if the original terms of the award are met. An additional expense is recognised for any modification that increases thetotal fair value of the share—based payment transaction, or is otherwise beneficialto the employee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled. it is treated as if it vested on the date of cancellation. and any expense not yet recognised forthe award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vesting conditions within the control of either the entity or theemployee are not met. However. if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award. and designated as a replacement award on thedate that it is granted. the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award. as described in theprevious paragraph. All cancellations of equity-settled transaction awards are treated equally.
The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additionat share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings per share (furtherdetails are given in Note 11)
0 Provisions
A provision is recognised an the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event.and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. If the effect is material. provisions aredetermined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and, when appropriate. the risks specific to the liability. Further details on provisions are given in Note 24.
P Revenue and its recognitionRevenue comprises:
- Income from the ownership and operation of hotels — recognised at the point at which the accommodation and related services areprovided:

Disclosure of segmental information is principally presented in respect of the Group‘s geographical segments. The segments reportedreflect the operating information included in internal reports that the Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM'), which is the Board,regularly reviews. Further detaiis are given in Note 5.
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incurexpenses. including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group's other components. Discrete financial

information is reported to and is reviewed by the CODM on a geographical basis, Operating segments have Chief Operating Officers(“COOS) or equivalent who are directly accountable for the functioning of their segments and maintain regular contact with the GroupChief Executive Officer and Chairman of the CODM to discuss the operational and financial performance. The CODM makes decisionsabout allocation of resources to the regions managed by the C005. No operating segments have been aggregated to form the reportableoperating segments.
Segment results that are reported to the CODM include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on areasonable basis. Unallocated items principally comprise interest-bearing loans. borrowings. cash and cash equivalents. net financeexpense. taxation balances and corporate expenses
S Non-current assets held-for-sule
Non-current assets (or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities) that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale ratherthan through continuing use are classified as held-for-sale, Generally the assets (or disposal group) are measured at the lower of theircarrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to property. plant and equipmentand lease premium prepayment, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on a pro rata basis. except that no loss is allocated toinventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, employee benefit assets and investment property, which continue to be measured inaccordance with the Group's accounting policiesv Impairment losses on initial classification as held-for-sale and subsequent gains or losseson remeasurement are recognised in the income statement. Gains are not recognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss
T Other ﬁnancial assets and lid bilitiesTrade investments are classified as available-for-sale assets and are included under non-current assets within ‘other financial assets't Theyare recorded at market value with movements in value taken to equity. Any impairment to value is recorded in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables are stated at their nominal amount (discounted if material) Less any impairment. Trade and other payablesare stated at their nominal amount (discounted if material).
U Related parties
For the purpose of these financial statements. parties are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability. directly orindirectly, to control the party or exercise signiﬁcant influence over the party making financial and operating decisions. or vice versa, orwhere the Group and the party are subiect to common control or common significant influence. Related parties may be individuals orother entities.
Management has discussed with the Audit Et Risk Committee the selection and disclosure of the Group's critical accounting policies andestimates and the application of these policies and estimates.
The preparation of financial statements Under IFRS requires the Group to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amountsof assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingencies and the reported amount of revenue and expenses during the year. The Groupevaluates its estimates and assumptions on an ongoing basis Such estimates and iudgements are based Upon historical experience andother factors it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances, which form the basis for making [Udgements about the carrying value ofassets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.
Certain critical accounting policies. among others, affect the Group's more significant estimates and assumptions used in preparing theconsolidated financial statements. Actual results could differ from the Group's estimates and assumptions.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATEDFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The key iudgements are:
Classiﬁcation of investment propertiesThe Group holds a number of investment properties and accounts for such properties in accordance with the accounting policy set out InNote 2,2H. The Group owns assets which are [eased to external third parties with lease rentals and related charges varying according to
the agreement involved. The Group accounts for such assets in its financioI statements in accordance with the accounting policy set out inNote 2.2H.
Where the indicators are such that on balance the Group is shown to be a passive investor, the relevant property is accounted for inaccordance with IAS 40 and the Group accounts for the fair value change through the income statement as other operating income orexpense Indicators considered include (I) party that has the power to make the significant operating and financing decisions regarding theoperations of the property in a management contract. (2) calculation of the lessor's return. (3) lessor's power of intervention Under themanagement contract. and (4) duration of the contract.
Consolidation of entities in which the Group holds less than a majority of voting rights (de facto control)
In 2014. the new consolidation accounting standard, IFRS 10 Introduced a new control model that focuses on whether the Group has powerover on investee. exposure or rights to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and ability to use its power to affect thosereturns.
This required the Group to consider whether it has de facto control over its investees. particularly when it owned less than 50% of the votingrights. In 2014. in accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 10. the Group reassessed the control conclusion for its investees andchanged its control conclusion in respect of its investment in CDL Hospitality Trusts (“CDLHT”), which was previously accounted for as anassociate using the equity method. Although the Group owns less than half of the voting power of the investee, management determinedthat, underlFRS10, the Group has had control over the investee since its inception, This is because a 100% owned subsidiary of the Group,M&C REIT Management Limited acts as REIT Manager with its fees having a performance-based element and therefore the Group hasexposure to variable returns from its involvement with the investee. Accordingly. in 2014. the Group applied acquisition accounting to theinvestment from the year it was first established in 2006, and restated the relevant amounts as if the investee had been consolidated fromthat year. This iudgement was reconsidered this year and continues to be appropriate.
Business combination
For each acquisition. the Group has to make a iudgement whether to account the transaction as an asset purchase or Cl businesscombination. which results in a different accounting treatment In particuIar. Under business combination accounting, goodwill andadditional intangible assets may arise and the valuation of acquired assets is complex. In addition. transaction costs can be capitalised inan asset acquisition, but have to be charged through the income statement for a business combination. The classification of eachacquisition and related accounting is highly iudgementol. Details of acquisitions Undertaken by the Group during the year. including thespecific iudgements. are set out in Notes 12 and 14.
Land leases classiﬁcation
The Group holds a number of hotels with leases of land that are determined to have an indefinite economic life. These are classified as afinance lease, even if at the end of the lease term title does not pass to the lessee. In determining whether the lease of land should beaccounted for as a finance or an operating lease. the following factors were considered:
- transfer of ownership0 purchase options0 present value of minimum lease payments in comparison to fair value of land.

The key estimates are:
Impairment of tangible assets
The Group determines whether tangible fixed assets are impaired when indicators of impairments exist or based on the annual impairmentassessment. The annual assessment requires an estimate of the recoverable value of the cash generating Units to which the tangible fixedassets are allocated, which is predominantly at the individual hotel site level. Where appropriate. external valuations are also Undertaken.Estimation of the recoverable value of the hotel assets is done with the reference to fair value less cost to sell, using income approach.which requires estimation of future cash flows of a third party efficient operator, the time period over which they will occur, an appropriatediscount rates, terminal capitalization rates and growth rates. The Directors consider that the assumptions made represent their bestestimate. and that the discount rate and terminal capitalisation rate used are appropriate given the risks associated with the specific cashflows. A sensitivity analysis has been performed over the estimates (see Note 12).
Taxation
In determining the income tax assets and liabilities recognised in the consolidated Statement of Financial Position. the Group is required toestimate the outcome of multiple tax years remaining open to tax authority audit in each of the iurisdictions in which the Group hascompanies. As such provisions for tax accruals require estimates to be made on the interpretation of tax legislation, developments in taxcase law and the potential outcomes of tax audits and appeals. The final resolution of certain of these items may give rise to materialincome statement and/or cash flow variances. In making estimates for tax provisioning purposes management makes use of in-house taxexpertise, comparable third party studies prepared by professional advisors and any other information available. In the event of an auditthe Group may liaise with the relevant taxation authorities to agree an outcome.
The tax liability provided for each tax year and [Urisdiction is reassessed in each period to reflect our best estimate of the probable outcomein light of all the information available. A final position agreed with a tax authority or through expiry of a tax audit period could differ fromthe estimates made by us which would impact the current tax liability of £23m (2016: £35m) recognised in the consolidated Statement ofFinancial Position.
The following standards and interpretations. which have been issued by the IASB. become effective after the current year end and have notbeen early adopted by the Group:
' In January 2016. the IASB issued 'IFRS 16 Leases'. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or af‘ter1januaw 2019 and wasendorsed by the European Union in November 2017‘ |FRS1b results in lessees accounting for most leases within the scope of the standardin a manner similar to the way in which finance leases are currently accounted for under IAS 17 Leases. Lessees will recognise a ‘right ofuse‘ asset and a corresponding financial liability on the balance sheet. The asset will be amortised over the period of the lease and thefinancial liability measured at amortised costs Lessor accounting remains substantially the same as in IAS 17. The Group is currentlyassessing the impact of this standard but it is not practicable to quantify the effect as at the date of the publication of these financialstatements.
- In May 2014. the IASB issued ‘IFR’S 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers'. The standard is effective for annual periods beginning on orafterl Januaw 2018 with early application permitted. The standard was endorsed by the European Union in September 2016. IFRS 15provides a principles-based approach for revenue recognition and introduces the concept of recognising revenue \‘or obligations as theyare satisfied. The standard should be applied retrospectively, with certain practical expedients available. The Group has started to assessthe requirements of the standard and preliminary findings suggest that there will be no material impact to revenue.
' On 24July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued 'IFR'S 9 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement whichis effective for periods starting on or after1January 2016A IFRS 9 addresses the classification, measurement and derecognition of financialassets and financial liabilities, introduces new rules for hedge accounting and a new impairment model for financial assets. Debtinstruments currently classified as held-to maturity and measured at amortised cost will meet the conditions for classification at amortisedcost under IFRS 9. The Company believes that its current hedge relationships will qualify as continuing hedges. upon the adoption of IFRS9. The impact of this accounting standard on the Group's accounts is considered immaterial
