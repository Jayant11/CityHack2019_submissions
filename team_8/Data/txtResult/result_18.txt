Many ofourcustomers, who are manufacturers of these products, are expanding their production bases beyondJapan, Europe, and the Americas. This expansion has been directed particularly toward China and otherparts ofAsia, which explains why sales in China (including Hong Kong), accounted for 32.5% ofnetsales in the year under review, were the highest. Our second-largest geographic market is the UnitedStates, which accounted for 27.4% ofnet sales. The third largest, Japan, accounted for 14.6% of netsales, and remaining net sales coming from Europe, Thailand, and other countries.


Outline of Strategy We will thoroughly review productivity to boost the proﬁtability of our existing lines. We will alsoexpand our EMS (Electro Mechanics Solutions) business which is driven by MITSUMI ELECTRICC0,, LTD. and our group’s combined technological strengths in electronic devices and components aswell as machined components. We will leverage the combined wealth of experience we have gained inmanufacturing, sales, engineering and development to provide ﬂexible prices and meet the needs of ourcustomers. We will actively work on improving our proﬁtability and increasing corporate value ViaM&As and alliances. At the same time, we will focus on establishing large-scale overseas mass pro-duction facilities as well as global R&D capabilities in light ofregional risk assessment ﬁndings, whileaiming to achieve either net sales of¥1 trillion or operating income of¥100 billion by the ﬁscal yearending March 2021.
We have developed the following policy to guide us in concrete terms as we move ahead with the
aforementioned initiatives:
1. We will work to restructure our business portfolio by categorizing products and businesses intocore, sub—core and non—core businesses.
(i) Our core businesses are deﬁned as businesses and products which have absolute permanence,much like the “rice” of industry, in which our group can particularly demonstrate its competi‘tiveness and secure competitive advantage, and these are positioned as the key pillars of ourfuture growth strategy. More speciﬁcally, bearings, motors, sensors, connectors/switches,power supply components, wireless/communications/soﬁware, and analog semi—conductorsare positioned as MinebeaMitsumi’s “Seven Spears”, We will actively invest managementresources such as people, money and goods into these core businesses.
(ii) Our sub-core businesses are businesses and products which are not permanent but from whichsigniﬁcant proﬁts can be anticipated, such as smartphones, games, and HDD products, In thesebusiness areas, we will work to thoroughly improve productivity and develop new componentsin order to enhance our competitiveness, while taking measures to prepare for the eventualshrinking of the market.
(iii) Non-core businesses will be targets for bold choice and selection.
2. In addition to existing businesses, we will accelerate the development and commercialization ofthe“+IOT business” as high value-added solutions that combine products and technologies held byMITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD.
More speciﬁcally, we will develop and provide new solutions such as Smart Cities, bed sensors,and sensory devices (haptics) by combining input equipment (such as strain gages, MEMS sensors,camera modules, antennas, etc.) with conversion and control equipment (such as wireless, switch-ing power supply components, battery protection ICs, power supply ICs, driver circuits, invertercircuits, etc.), and our output equipment (such as bearings, lighting equipment, LED backlights,sensory devices, actuators, motors, etc.).

Net SalesDuring the ﬁscal year under review, although the Japanese economy showed a gradualrecovery in consumer spending backed by an improvement in employment and incomeconditions and increasing signs of a recovery in corporate production and exports, therewas a growing sense of uncertainty about the future in the second half of the ﬁscal yeardue to concerns about the direction ofpolicy taken by the new U.S. administration. TheUS. economy continued to grow moderately amid a recovery in domestic and foreigndemand and heightened expectations concerning ﬁscal spending and tax cuts put forwardby the new administration. The European economy remained robust across the board cen-tered on internal demand, although Brexit has cast a shadow ofuncertainty. Meanwhile,the sense of uncertainty in Asia cannot be cast aside despite the expectation that theChinese economy will recover from its slowdown with the support ofpublic investments.
Working against this backdrop, the MinebeaMitsumi Group has been concentrating oncutting costs, creating high-value-added products, developing new technologies, andenhancing its marketing approach to boost proﬁtability further.
As a result, net sales increased by ¥29,1 13 million (4.8%) year on year to reach¥638,927 million, a record high in net sales since the Company was founded.
Cost of Sales
Cost of sales was up by ¥26,407 million (5.4%) from the previous ﬁscal year to total¥513,078 million in the year under review, due mainly to the consolidation of MITSUMIELECTRIC C0,, LTD. Cost of sales as a percentage ofnet sales increased by 0.5percentage points year on year to reach 803%.
SGA Expenses
SGA expenses increased by ¥5,129 million (7.2%) from the previous ﬁscal year to total¥76,834 million in the year under review, due mainly to the effect of consolidatingMITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD, and the increase in costs related to the businessintegration with MITSUMI ELECTRIC CO, LTD. SGA expenses as a percentage ofnetsales increased by 0.2 percentage points from the previous year to hit 12.0% in the yearunder review,

The main items recorded were a gain on bargainpurchase amounting ¥14,620 million due to the share exchange with MITSUMIELECTRIC C0,, LTD., 3 loss 0f¥6,196 million due to redemption Ofconvertible bondsrepurchased in June 2016 and impairment losses of ¥3,922 million mainly related to LEDbacklights for LCDs,

This decline was due to the reduction of the cor-porate, inhabitant, and business taxes as a result of lower taxable income led by the redemp-tion Ofconvertible bonds. The effective income tax rate dropped to 14.4% from 22.1% inthe previous ﬁscal year. This drop was due mainly to recognition of gain on bargain purchase.

We have entered into various currency exchange contracts and other derivatives trans-actions to hedge these risks, but fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates may affectour operating results and/or ﬁnancial position over the long term.
3. R&D risk
While we focus on R&D to introduce a constant stream ofnew, high-quality products, wemay not reap a ﬁnancial reward from our R&D investments. There are no guarantees thatour R&D efforts will come to fruition.
4. Legal risk
The Legal Department is responsible for managing risk related to lawsuits and other legalactions brought in relation to MinebeaMitsumi Group operations in Japan and/or overseas.We are subject to the risk that lawsuits or other actions with the potential to affect ouroperating results and/or ﬁnancial position may be brought against us in the future.
5. Risk related to price negotiations
We continue to face intense competition from lower-priced products made overseas. We aresubject to the risk that we will be unable to maintain or increase our market share shouldmarket needs shift to low-priced products.
6. Risk related to raw materials and logistics costs
We purchase a variety ofmaterials from external suppliers. While we work with an eye tomaintaining optimal inventory volumes along with access to a steady supply of materials atstable prices, rising material prices could affect our operating results and/or ﬁnancialposmon.
7. Latent risk related to operations overseas
The MinebeaMitsumi Group’s manufacturing activities are conducted primarily inThailand, China, Philippines and Cambodia. While we have been operating in thesecountries for quite some time, overseas operations are always subject to the following risks(any of which could have a negative impact on our operating results and/or ﬁnancialposition):
(a) Unexpected changes to laws or regulations
(b) Difﬁculty in attracting and securing qualiﬁed human resources
(0) Acts of terrorism or war, or other occurrences that could disrupt social order.
8. Risk related to natural and other disasters
If an eaithquake, ﬂood, or other natural disaster, as well as nuclear plant accident, oroutbreak of a new type of infectious disease were to affect the operational bases of theMinebeaMitsumi Group or its suppliers, it could have a signiﬁcant impact on ourproduction and sales activities.

Message to Our Shareholders
During the period ended March 2017, the world economyoverall trended firmly despite high levels of uncertaintyabout the future economy due to concern about thedirection of the UK’s Brexit negotiations to leave theEuropean Union and about the policy trends of the newUS administration.
On Jan. 27, 2017, Minebea 00.. Ltd. and MITSUMIELECTRIC 00., LTD. conducted a business integration ofthe two companies, with Minebea 00., Ltd. allocating itsshares to MITSUMI ELECTRIC 00., LTD. shareholders ata ratio of 1:059 and MITSUMI ELECTRIC 00., LTD.becoming its fulIy-owned subsidiary. We changed ourcompany name to MINEBEA MITSUMI Inc. and embarkedon a new start.
In this economic environment. the group focused onthoroughgoing cost reductions, the development of highvalue-added products and new technologies, and activi-ties to expand sales in order to realize the furtherimprovement of our earning power. As a result, net salesfor the period finished at a record high of 638.9 billionyen. Operating income was lower this term at 49.0 bil-lion yen, but due to the effects of the business integra-tion with MITSUMI ELECTRIC (20., LTD., net income wasa new record for profits at 41.1 billion yen.
Key Strategies in the Fiscal Year Ended March 2017
During the period ended March 2017, demand for ball bearingswas very strong, with our monthly external sales volumereaching up to 180 million units per month. In accordance withthis, we also achieved our highest ever ﬁgures on a monthlyproduction volume base, recording up to 264 million units permonth. Meanwhile, in motors, expansion of sales for the auto-motive business has progressed and is driving the second col-umn of growth. In LED backlights, while sales volume to ourmain customers has reduced, we are seeking to improve ourshare in China and progress in acceleration depreciation ofequipment is also contributing to proﬁtability.
In the machined components area, we reviewed the entireprocess at each plant for ball bearings and rod end bearings andbegan activities to signiﬁcantly improve productivity per per-son, which are already producing positive effects. Even as themarket is shrinking in pivot assemblies for hard disk driveunits (HDD), we raised our world share to over 80% andincreased our sales volume.
In the area of parts for electronics devices, we are proceed-ing steadily with development of narrow frame LCD displaysable to contend with organic EL. In LED backlights, we plan toshift signiﬁcantly from the conventional smartphone markettoward the automotive market, which still has room for furtherexpansion. Operation of our new plant in Slovakia is plannedfor January 2018. This plant will be our production base forautomotive motors for the European market, but in response tostrong customer requests for LED backlights too, we intend to

produce them in Slovakia at some point. SALIOT LED lightingequipment has obtained US safety certiﬁcation and will now goon sale in the US. We have established a SALIOT showroomclose to our Tokyo head ofﬁce building and are proceedingwith preparations for its opening in August 2017. Customerresponse has been positive and we are actively conducting salespromotion activities. In Smart Cities, we are currently engag-ing in efforts for the world-top class Smart City project inCambodia’s Phnom Penh which should take form during thisterm and trying to gain the involvement of various Japanesecompanies. In bed sensors, the sales launch is planned soonand we recently concluded a joint business development con-tract with Ricoh Co., Ltd. We plan to use this as a platform forour group’s healthcare business.
In the MITSUMI business segment, in addition to a newgames console contributing to proﬁtability, increasing demandfor 015 for smartphone cameras is expected to continue andwith improvements in productivity, signiﬁcant increases insales and proﬁts are planned.
Looking Back on the Fiscal Year Ended March 2017
In the Japanese economy, moderate recovery of personal con-sumption is evident in light of improvements in employmentand income situation, and signs of recovery in corporate pro-duction and exports have increased but due to concern aboutthe policy trends of the new US administration, uncertainty has

9. Risk related to compliance and internal controls
We engage in a wide range ofbusinesses all around the world and are subject to the lawsand regulations that are in effect in each region. We have established and operate appropri-ate internal control systems needed to achieve our objectives. While these systems providereasonable assurance that the methods used to prepare our ﬁnancial statements are appropri-ate and in compliance with relevant laws, they cannot provide an absolute guarantee that allour objectives will be met. They are also not a guarantee that all potential risks we may facein the future, including legal Violations, will be avoided. Changes in laws and regulations7including the interpretation or enforcement thereof, may make compliance more complexand could even incur higher costs related to compliance.
10. Losses related to competition laws
As previously disclosed, certain consolidated subsidiaries have been investigated bycompetition authorities for the alleged infringement of competition laws related to thetrading of small-sized ball bearing products, etc.
The investigations have been completed, however, a class action suit was ﬁled in Canadaagainst MinebeaMitsumi and its subsidiaries in relation to these investigations.
Depending on the outcome of the above-mentioned lawsuit, we may incur losses fromcompensation for damages, However, we can neither reasonably project the amount of saidlosses at this time nor predict whether they will affect our operating performance orﬁnancial position.
11. Risk related to accrued post-retirement benefit and pension costs
Although the MinebeaMitsumi Group maintains multiple deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans, thefair value of pension assets may decrease due to a low rate of return on a pension fund, orpension costs may increase due to an increase in the pension obligation and a decline in theﬁinded status following a change in preconditions such as the discount rate.
12. Environmental risk
Our business is subject to various environmental laws and regulations that are in effect inthe regions where we operate, Although we pay due attention to ensuring compliance withall such laws and regulations, we could be subject to losses in the event that an incidentinvolving environmental contamination were to occur or in the event that the possibility ofsuch an incident were to arise,


13. Risk related to M&As and alliances
While we are continually seeking M&A and alliance opportunities, M&As and alliancesmay not produce the results initially expected or an alliance may not be maintained due to aconﬂict of interest with respect to strategies, etc. We may provide an alliance partner withﬁnancial support if its ﬁnancial health deteriorates or for other reasons which in turn couldadversely affect our business performance and ﬁnancial condition.
14. Quality risk
Our products are used across a wide range of industries, especially for applications thatrequire a high degree ofprecision (including end products that could affect human healthand safety such as automobiles, aircraft, medical devices, etc.). We recognize the socialresponsibility we bear and have a system in place to ensure our products are of the highestquality. However, if any of our products were found to be defective and resulted in a seriousaccident, the suspension ofour customers’ manufacturing operations, or a product recall,we could incur signiﬁcant expenses, or lose public conﬁdence, any of which could result ina material adverse effect on our operating results and ﬁnancial status.
15. Information management risk
Through the course of our business operations, we obtain large amounts of important infor-mation, including personal information. While we maintain information security policiesthat prevent the undesired disclosure as well as unintended use of information, a securitybreach could occur due to unforeseen circumstances. Addressing such an incident couldincur huge losses and expose us to the risk of losing public conﬁdence.

However, to ensure an evenproper disclosure of consolidated ﬁnancial statements the ﬁscal year end have been changedto March 31.

Inventories
Millianx qucn2017 2016
Merchandise and ﬁnished goods ¥ 43,745 ¥ 49,399Work in process 32,962 29,874Raw materials 36,167 18,799Supplies 7,567 4,939¥120,441 ¥103,011
The amount of losses on devaluation and disposal of inventories included in cost ofsales for the years ended March 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 were ¥6,663 million, ¥172million, and ¥614 million, respectively
f) Tangible fixed assetsTangible ﬁxed assets are stated at acquisition cost. Depreciation of the Company and itsconsolidated subsidiaries is computed primarily by the straight-line method based upon theestimated useful lives of the assets‘ The declining balance method is adopted for certainmachinery and equipment used for the manufacture of LED backlights for LCDS. Theestimated useful lives of ﬁxed assets are predominantly 5 to 50 years for buildings andstructures, 2 to 15 years for machinery and transportation equipment and 2 to 20 years fortools, furniture and ﬁxtures.
Maintenance and normal repair expenses are charged against income when incurred,while signiﬁcant renewals and improvements are capitalized.
(Change in accounting policy which is difﬁcult to distinguish from the change inaccounting estimates)The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have previously adoptedthe declining-balance method for the depreciation method Oftangible ﬁxed assets otherthan buildings; however, the straithine method is adopted from the year endedMarch 31, 20171
The Group plans to make investments in Japan and Thailand for the aircraft compo-nents business, In the wake of the decision on the investment project, the Group reviewedthe depreciation method of tangible ﬁxed assets.

The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries adopted the declining balancemethod primarily for the depreciation method of buildings; however, the straight-linemethod is adopted from the year ended March 31, 2016.
Having reviewed the depreciation method on recent occasions such as acquisition of theHeadquarters building, and construction of the Matsuida Plant as well as the KashiwazakiPlant, the Company concluded that such buildings are to be used stably for a long—period oftime, irrespective of the proﬁtability and operational situation of the facilities so that thebeneﬁts ofutilization shall be realized in proportion to the lapse 0ftime, therefore thestraight—line method better reﬂects the current economic situation of the Company.
Due to the change, depreciation expense decreased, while operating income andincome before income taxes increased by ¥353 million, respectively, in the year endedMarch 31, 2016.
Losses 0n disposals of ﬁxed assets incurred from buildings and structures, machineryand transportation equipments and other ﬁxed assets, amounting to ¥365 million, ¥981million and ¥579 million, respectively, for the year ended March 31, 2017.

h) Accounting for retirement benefitsTo provide for the payment of retirement beneﬁt to employees, the Company and itsconsolidated domestic subsidiaries sponsor funded and unfunded deﬁned beneﬁt pensionplans and deﬁned contribution pension plans,Deﬁned beneﬁt pension plans (funded) provide lump-sum payments or annuity basedon salary and length ofservice,Certain consolidated foreign subsidiaries sponsor funded and unfunded deﬁned beneﬁtpension plans or deﬁned contribution pension plans.The beneﬁt formula basis is used to attribute expected retirement beneﬁts to each period.Past service costs are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of 10 years.Actuarial gains and losses are amortized using the straight-line method over a period of5 years, from the period subsequent to the period in which they are incurred.Unrecognized actuarial gains and losses and unrecognized past service costs arerecognized as remeasurements of deﬁned beneﬁt plans in total accumulated othercomprehensive income within the net assets, after adjusting for tax effects.
(Change ofaccounting policy)
From the year ended March 31, 2015, the Company adopted the provisions set forth inparagraph 35 0f the “Accounting Standard for Retirement Beneﬁts” (ASBJ StatementN0. 26, issued on May 17, 2012) and paragraph 67 ofthe “Guidance on AccountingStandard for Retirement Beneﬁts” (ASBJ Guidance N0. 25, revised on March 26, 2015).Accordingly, the method used to calculate retirement beneﬁt obligations and service costshas been revised, and the method to attribute expected retirement beneﬁts to each periodhas been changed from the straight-line basis to the beneﬁt formula basis. Additionally themethod for determining the discount rate has been changed from a single discount ratebased on the average number of years approximating the residual terms of all employees,to multiple discount rates based on the expected beneﬁt payments attributed to periods ofservice ofrelevant employees,
In accordance with the transitional accounting as stipulated in paragraph 37 of the“Accounting Standard for Retirement Beneﬁts”, the effect of the changes in accountingpolicies arising from the revision of liabilities for retirement beneﬁts and service costs isrecognized as retained earnings at the beginning of the year ended March 31, 2015.
As a result of these adjustments, net deﬁned beneﬁt liability increased by ¥369 million,and retained earnings decreased by ¥237 million at the beginning of the year endedMarch 31, 2015. The effect ofthese adjustments on operating income and income beforeincome taxes for the year ended March 31, 2015 is immaterial,
Net assets per share declined by ¥0,64, Impact on net income per share and diluted netincome per share is immaterial.

been high in the second half of the term‘ The US economy hascontinued to show moderate economic expansion amid increas-ing expectations for ﬁscal stimulus and tax cuts advocated bythe new administration, in addition to recovery of domesticand overseas demand. In the European economy, Europe over-all has trended ﬁrmly centered on domestic demand, despitethe overhanging uncertainty about the direction of the UK‘sBrexit negotiations to leave the EU. Meanwhile, with regard tothe Asian economy, recovery from economic slowdown isexpected for the Chinese economy, underpinned by publicinvestment, but uncertainty about the future still cannot bedispelled.
In this economic environment, the group focused on thor-oughgoing cost reductions, the development of high Value-added products and new technologies, and activities to expandsales in order to realize the further improvement of our earningpower.
Moreover, on Jan. 27, 2017, the group conducted a businessintegration by share exchange with MITSUMI ELECTRICCO., LTD., incorporating it into our group’s consolidated tar-gets from that date.
Presenting results by segment gives the following It shouldbe noted that from this ﬁscal year, in accordance with our busi-ness integration with MITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD., wenewly disclose MITSUMI’s business in our reportable segments.In the machined components segment, apart from ball bear-ings, which are the group’s main products, there were mainlymechanical parts such as rod end bearings for use in aircraftand pivot assemblies for HDDs, as well as screws for use inautomobiles and aircraft. Due to increased demand for ballbearings, our main products, based on expanded needs forenergy—saving and safety devices for the automotive market,we recorded a new highest record for external sales volume butsales fell due to the effects of exchange rates, etc. Meanwhile,sales fell for rod end bearings due to the effects of exchangerates and the fall in production of large aircraft in the com-mercial aircraft market. Although pivot assemblies wereaffected by the contraction of the HDD market, the salesquantity still increased, but sales fell due to the impact ofexchange rates.
In the electronics devices segment, electronics devices (LCDbacklights and sensing devices (measuring components), etc.),HDD spindle motors, stepping motors, DC motors, air movers(fan motors), precision motors and special components are themain products. As for LCD backlights, demand remainedstrong for our group’s products with superior thin technologyfor the smartphone market. Motors performed well, centeredon products for automobiles such as stepping motors. However,sales fell due to the impact of exchange rates.
The MITSUMI business segment primarily makes productssuch as semi-conduc’tors, optical devices, mechanical parts,high-frequency components, power source parts. Productssuch as camera actuators, switches, and battery protection ICsfor smartphones have shown steady consumption in NorthAmerica and China. In addition, sales have grown in automo-tive products such as antennas, communication modules andconnectors.
In the other segment, company—made machinery is the mainproducts and revenue increased.
Outlook for Fiscal Year Ending March 2018(as of May 2017)
The Japanese economy during the period ending March 2018,moderate recovery is evident due to robust domestic and over-seas demand and improvements in corporate proﬁts, etc., butconcern remains about exchange rates due to heightened globalgeopolitical risk. The US economy is expected to remain steadyas the employment and income environment are steadilyimproving, despite growing concerns about the new adminis-tration’s policy implementation capabilities. The Europeaneconomy is expected to continue its internal demand-led ﬁrmeconomic growth despite the existence of major factors ofuncertainty such as the UK’s Brexit negotiations to leave theEU and political trends after the elections in France andGermany, etc. The Chinese economy is anticipated to remainsteady due to expansion of infrastructure investment, etc.,despite concerns about the direction of future trade negotia-tions with the US.
In such circumstances, the group is forecasting full—yearconsolidated results with net sales of 750 billion yen, operat-ing income of 56 billion yen, ordinary income of 55 billionyen and net income attributable to owners of the parent of41.5 billion yen.
In the machined components segment, in accordance withincreases in global demand, we will further raise results forball bearings, our main products, by continuing to advancepositive sales expansion in the automobile industry and infor-mation communication deVice-related industries, etc., andmaking further signiﬁcant improvements in production. Withregard to rod end bearings, we are improving production efﬁ-ciency by reviewing production methods from the fundamen-tals, and we are seeking to expand sales in the small andmedium-sized aircraft markets where further growth isanticipated.
As for LCD backlights in the electronics devices segment,we will continue to supply high value-added products such asultrathin light guide plates for high-end smartphones, andadvance sales for automotive products where future expansionis expected. We will further improve the quality of motors suchas stepping motors and reduce their costs and advance salesexpansion of high value-added products for automobiles andservers, etc., to further improve results.
In the MITSUMI business segment’s smartphone-relatedproducts such as camera actuators and switches, we are seek-ing to further expand sales by improving productivity andmaintaining quality, as increasingly high-functioning modelsemerge. In automotive products such as antennas, communica-tion modules and connectors, we are seeking to improve resultsby establishing a global production and supply regime, as wellas expanding our line-up. In addition, we are enhancing ourcompetitiveness by creating signiﬁcant synergy effects usingthe scale of our entire group to expand sales, reduce costs ofmaterials and physical distribution costs, and for new productdevelopment.
In other segment, we will aim for the improvement of pro-duction efﬁciency in ﬁnished product divisions and for furtherincreases in quality by focusing on increasing the precision ofcompany-made machinery parts

In addition, we have presented to all our employees the Mine-beaMitsumi “Seven Spears. These Seven Spears are productswhich were selected based on the following three criteria, whenwe were considering business areas to focus on for growth in themid— to long-term from among all the Various businesses in ourportfolio. The ﬁrst criterion is that the market scale is large. Thesecond criterion is that within this large market scale there is aniche area where we can use our core competency in ultra-pre-cision machining technology to realize our presence. The thirdcriterion is that the corresponding product has pennanence andwill not easily disappear. For example, bearings are a staple prod-uct with a large market, much like the “rice” of industry, whichare not likely to easily disappear even as technology progresses.In addition, in the overall bearings market, we compete particu-larly in miniature and small-diameter size ball bearings with anoutside diameter of 22mm or less. We believe that we should ap-proach other products in a similar way in the future, such as sen-
{Billion yen)
sors, connectors/switches, power sources, wireless, and analogsemi—conductors. This is our vision for our group, based on ourthinking about how to use our group’s various technologies andbusiness management resources in the future to demonstrate ourcompetitiveness. However, producing ample proﬁt from invest-ment in all these areas will not be something that happens todayor tomorrow, but will be a matter for the long stretch.

Theseefforts have enabled us to move ahead with laying a solid foun-dation for MinebeaMitsumi’s 100th year of operations andachieve our best performance ever in the ﬁscal year ended March20171 We forecast an even better performance of 750 billion tenin net sales this ﬁscal year, while we anticipate net sales of 720billion next ﬁscal year, in light of the anticipated fall in LEDbacklights.
The signiﬁcant proﬁtability of MITSUMI’s business isexpected to signiﬁcantly contribute to proﬁts and we aim to real-ize net sales of 800 billion yen and operating proﬁt of 80 billionyen in the third year.
We continue to enjoy the huge market share we have gar-nered for our anchor product line, miniature and small—sizedball bearings, as well as HDD pivot assemblies, rod-end bear-ings for aircraft, LED backlights for high-end thin smart-phones, etc. All of us at MinebeaMitsumi will continue to workwith passion as we steadily build on these products to ensurethat when we reach our 100th anniversary, we will still be anindispensable parts manufacturer.

Hansen’s major product line includes permanent magnet synchronous motorsprimarily used in residential air conditioning system, etc. Even though a constantdemand for synchronous motors going forward is anticipated, due to the fact that thedemand for synchronous motors has shifted from the US to Europe in recent yearsand that the motor itself is a motor of an old structure so that the Company do notexpect desirable synergetic effects to be generated with its product lines. As such, theCompany have decided to transfer the business to ElectroCraft, Inc,, one of the globalleaders in the manufacture of fractional»horsepower motors for use in motion controlsolutions, with its head ofﬁce located in the US. as well.

23. Segment Information, etc.
3) Segment information
Outline of reponable segments
The Company’s reportable segments are components for which separate ﬁnancial infor-mation is available and subject to periodic reviews in order for the Company’s Board ofDirectors to determine the distribution of management resources and evaluate performance.
The Company established business divisions by product in key business centers, thereinMachined Component Manufacturing Headquarters supervises the production of machinedcomponents, Electronic Device and Component Manufacturing Headquarters oversees themanufacture of small-sized motors, electronic devices and components, and optical prod-ucts, etc. and Mitsumi Business Headquarters is responsible for the production of semicon-ductor devices, optical devices, mechanical components, etc. and formulates comprehensivebusiness strategies to be implemented for both domestic and foreign operations. Therefore,the Company identiﬁes three reportable segments consisting of “Machined components,”“Electronic devices and components” and “MITSUMI business.”
The core products in the “Machined components” are mechanical pans, such as ballbearings, rod-end bearings, pivot assemblies of HDDs, fastener for automobiles and aircraft,etc. The “Electronic devices and components includes electronic devices (LED backlightsfor LCDs, sensing devices (measuring components), etc.), HDD spindle motors, steppingmotors, DC motors, air movers (fan motors), precision motors, and special devices. Thestaple products of “MITSUMI business” include semiconductor devices, optical devices,mechanical parts, high frequency components, power supply components, etc.
“MITSUMI business” is disclosed as a new reportable segment from the year endedMarch 31, 2017, following the acquisition of MITSUMI ELECTRIC CO., LTD.
From the year ended March 31, 2016, the Company has made some organizationalchanges, including incorporating its in-house manufacturing division into the Electronicdevices and components manufacturing headquarters. Due to these changes, the segmentinfomation has also been changed, Segment information for the year ended March 31,2015 is based on the reportable segments subsequent to the organizational changes.
Basis of calculation for amounts of net sales, profit or loss, assets, liabilities and other items byreportable segmentThe accounting method for the reportable segments is basically the same as those in note“2. Summary of Signiﬁcant Accounting Policies.”
Income of each reportable segment is based on operating income (before amortizationof goodwill). Internal sales are calculated based on distribution prices determined bycomprehensive judgment considering market prices, manufacturing costs and other factors


(Change in accounting policy which is difﬁcult to distinguish from the change inaccounting estimates)
The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries have previously adopted
the declining-balance method for the depreciation method of tangible ﬁxed assets otherthan buildings; however, the straithine method is adopted from the year endedMarch 31, 2017.
The Group plans to make investments in Japan and Thailand for the aircraft compo-nents business, In the wake of the decision on the investment project, the Group reviewedthe depreciation method oftangible ﬁxed assets. As a result, the Group decided to changethe depreciation method of tangible ﬁxed assets to the straight-line method, since adoptingsuch method will more accurately and adequately reﬂect the actual state of economic con-ditions, given the stable operating situations of facilities and equipment throughout theirperiod of use
Due to this change, depreciation expense for the year ended March 31, 2017 decreased,while the segment income for “Machined components,” “Electronic devices and compo-nents,” “Other” and “Adjustment (cotporate)” segments increased by ¥123 million, ¥174million, ¥111 million, and ¥50 million, respectively.
The Company and its consolidated domestic subsidiaries adopted the declining balancemethod primarily for the depreciation method of buildings; however, the Company hasadopted the straight-line method from the year ended March 31, 2016.
Having reviewed the depreciation method on recent occasions such as acquisition of theHeadquaners building, and construction of the Matsuida Plant as well as the KashiwazakiPlant the Company concluded that such buildings are to be used stably for a long-period oftime, irrespective of the proﬁtability and operational situation of the facilities so that thebeneﬁts of utilization shall be realized in proportion to the lapse 0ftime, therefore thestraight-line method better reﬂects the current economic situation of the Company,
Due to this change, depreciation and amonization costs for the year ended March 31,2016 decreased, while the segment income for “Machined components,” “Electronicdevices and components” and “Adjustment (corporate)” segments increased by ¥29million, ¥101 million, and ¥222 million, respectively.

The scope of management‘s assessment of ICOFR in this annual report is different from the scope required by the Assessment Standards. Managementassessment ofICOFR for this annual report covers the ICOFR with respect to the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements only. In addition, as explainedin Note 1 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements are reclassiﬁed and additional information are providedfrom the consolidated ﬁnancial statements prepared for the purpose ofthe Act. The process of making reclassiﬁcations and the addition of certain infomationis for the convenience ofreaders outside Japan. Management voluntarily includes the process in its assessment oflCOFR, even though it is outside the scopeofthe Assessment Standards.
Scope of AssessmentThe reference date for the assessment of ICOFR was March 31, 2017, the end of the current ﬁscal year, and the assessment of the MINEBEA MITSUMI Inc.
and its consolidated subsidiaries was carried out based on the Assessment Standards.
In evaluating internal controls, management assessed internal controls that had a material impact on overall consolidated ﬁnancial reporting (entity levelinternal controls) and, based on such results, management identiﬁed business processes to be included within the scope 0fthe assessment, In order to assessthe effectiveness ofthe processelevel internal control described above, the details ofthe processes subject to assessment were initially analyzed. Key controlsthat were considered to have signiﬁcantly inﬂuence to the reliability ofﬁnancial reporting were then identiﬁed and the design and operation statuses ofthosekey controls were assessed accordingly.
For the scope of assessment for ICOFR, assessment was carried cut on entity-level internal control which had a signiﬁcant effect on the consolidatedﬁnancial reporting ofMINEBEA MITSUMI Inc. and its consolidated subsidiaries. This assessment was carried out at all ofour business locations excludingconsolidated subsidiaries which were determined quantitatively and qualitatively insigniﬁcant,

Then, processes which affected sales, accountsreceivables and inventories, which are the accounts closely associated with the company’s business objectives, were assessed for these business locations
In addition, by considering the impact to the consolidated ﬁnancial reporting, other signiﬁcant processes were also included in the assessment.
