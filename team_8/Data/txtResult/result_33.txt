The ﬁnancial instruments traded on a regulated market are assessed at the opening price on the daybefore the calculation date of the net asset value. When these financial instruments are traded onseveral regulated markets at the same time, the chosen opening price is the one of the regulatedmarket in which they are primarily traded,
However, in the absence of signiﬁcant transactions on a regulated market, the following financialinstruments are assessed using the following specific methods:
- Negotiable debt securities (“NDS”) having a residual life upon acquisition that is less than orequal to 3 months are assessed with a straight-line extension over the residual lifespan of thedifference between the acquisit‘on value and the redemption value, The management companynevertheless reserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the actual value in case ofparticular sensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalent securityissues allocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
» NDS, of which the residual lifespan at acquisition is greater than 3 months but of which theresidual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is equal to or less than 3 months, are assessedby means of a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of the difference between the lastadopted current value and the reimbursement value, The management company neverthelessreserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the actual value in case of particularsensitivity to market risks (rates, etc) The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
- NDS, of which the residual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is greater than 3 months,are assessed at their current value. The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer.
Firm future ﬁnancial instruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the clearing price onthe day before the net asset value calculation date. Conditional future financial instruments tradedon organised markets are assessed at the market value on the day before the net asset valuecalculation date, Over-the—counter ﬁrm or conditional future financial instruments are assessed atthe price given by the ﬁnancial instrument’s eounterparty. The management companyindependently carries out a veriﬁcation of this valuation.

Launched in 1957 at the initiative of the Commodities Research Bureau, the calculation method of the BenchmarkIndicator has been adjusted over time such as to keep pace with the successive evolutions 0f the commodities market.
The Benchmark Indicator beneﬁts from the expertise of both Reuters and CoreCommodin and is part of the benchmarkindicators on the evolution of the commodities market The Benchmark Indicator is intended to be a “global” index, inthat it takes in the evolution of the three main categories of commodities, namely energy, metals and agriculturalproducts (softs).
On 25 November 2005, 19 commodities selected according to their importance in the economic environment wererepresented within the Benchmark Indicator. The evolution of each of these commodities is reﬂected in [he BenchmarkIndicator with reference to the price of the futures contracts for these same commodities
These commodities futures contracts are listed on the New York (NYMEX, COMEX, NYBOT), Chicago (CBOT,CME) and London (LME) stock exchanges.
The weight of the performances of each constituent is predetermined by the calculating agent of the BenchmarkIndicator in order to account for the speciﬁc importance of each commodity in the economic environment, and whilemaintaining diversification.
Each constituent’s weight is readjusted each month so as to maintain a uniform exposure relative to each constituent,and thus to maintain the original diversiﬁcation level.
An exhaustive description and the complete methodology for the construction of the Benchmark Indicator as well asinformation on the composition and relative weights of the Benchmark Indicator's components will be available on thefollowing website: http://0n1ine.th0msonreutersicom/indices,
The monitored performance is that of the index closing prices
Benchmark Indicator performance calculation
The Benchmark Indicator’s performance at a ‘t date’ depends on the arithmetic mean of the prices of the futurescontracts underlying the Benchmark Indicator, weighted by the target weight attributed to each, plus the interest paid (atthe 91-day Treasury Bill rate) on a fully collateralised investment in the Benchmark Indicator.
It is understood that:
A ‘t date‘ is 21 Banking Day on the New York Mercantile Exchange calendar.
An ‘r date’ is the sixth Banking Day of a given month on the New York Mercantile Exchange calendar.
On each r date, the weights of each Benchmark Indicator constituent are rebalanced, i.ei adjusted to their target level,
For each t date there is a corresponding r date, which is the last rebalancing date. If a t date is a rebalancing date, thecorresponding r date is the previous rebalancing date.
W(i)r, is the target weight of the Benchmark Indicator futures contract i on the r date, such that:wmﬂn 5: mm, _:1
L
[\0
‘u{i),=1
Ev01(i) t, is the change in the price of futures contract i on the t date since the corresponding r date.F(i)t, the price of the futures contract i at a date t.
‘ FmE\'0H7i,~= ”i %[1)Jt;‘|
dud
Ind t, is the value of the Thomson Reuters/Corecommodity CRB Total Return Benchmark Indicator on the t date,Accordingly,
n9Ind: : Zwm, x Ind, x Eml(l!_.A-i
The index value Ind r is thus recalculated every t date that is a Banking Day following an r rebalancing date, Therefore,for a given t date that is the first Banking Day after an r rebalancing date, the value of Ind 1' is equal to the value of Ind t-1.
The futures contracts used to calculate the change are those with the nearest maturity date.
When a futures contract matures, it is replaced, or “rolled over, with the futures contract on the same underlying thathas the nearest maturity date. Contracts are rolled over monthly, on the first 4 Banking Days of the New YorkMercantile Exchange.
The interest paid (at the 91 day Treasury Bill rate) on a fully collateralised investment in the Benchmark Indicator iscalculated as shown below:

ETB — I 11’ 91— “l——><TBR,.361] *-
and‘TBRt-l’ being the 91-day Treasury Bill rate date t-1.
Since the calculation of the Benchmark Indicator is not based on direct investment in commodities but on indirectinvestment in futures contracts, the UCITS performance may be affected by the cost of renewing, or ‘rolling over' thesefutures contracts on a monthly basis. This phenomenon could negatively and progressively impact, in a significantmanner, the gap between the UCITS performance and the gross performance of the underlyings of the aforesaid futures,notably in case of long-term investment in the MF’s units.
Benchmark Indicator revision and comgositionThe composition of the Benchmark Indicator is revised monthly‘
The exact composition of the Benchmark Indicator and NYSE»Eur0next’s rules for index composition revision areavailable on the Internet at https://indices.nyx.c0m/
The frequency of the rebalancing indicated above will have an impact on the costs borne by the MF and may thereforeaffect the MF's performance.

Benchmark Indicator publicationThe Benchmark Indicator is available through Reuters and Bloomberg. On Reuters: TRJCRBTR
0n Bloomberg: CRYTRThe closing price of the Benchmark Indicator is available on the Internet,
Investment strategy:
1. Strategy employedThe MF will comply with the investment rules dictated by the European Directive no. 2009/65/EC dated 13 July 2009.
In pursuit of the greatest possible correlation with the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, the MF will reach itsmanagement objective using the indirect replication method which means that it will enter into one or more OTC swapcontracts enabling it to reach its investment objective. The objective of these swap contracts will be to exchange (i) thevalue of the MF's assets, which will consist of cash and/or balance sheet assets (excluding any securities received asguarantees), for (ii) the value of the securities that underlie the Benchmark Indicator.
The securities held as assets by the MF may notably be securities that make up the Benchmark Indicator, as well asother international equities, from all economic sectors, listed on all markets, including the small caps markets.
The basket of assets held may be adjusted daily such that its value will generally be at least 100% of the net assets.When necessary, this adjustment will be made to ensure that the counterparty risk arising from the aforementioned swapcontract will be entirely neutralized.
Information relative to the (i) updated composition of the basket of the balance sheet assets held in the MF’s portfolioand (ii) the market value of the future exchange operation entered into by the MF, are available on the page dedicated tothe MP on the site www.lyxoretf.com. The update frequency and/or the update date of the aforesaid information is alsoindicated on the same page of the aforesaid Internet site.
As part of the management of its exposure, the MF may be exposed on a component of the Benchmark Indicator, for upto 20% of its assets. This 20% limit will be verified at each rebalancing date of the Benchmark Indicator, in compliancewith the method of calculation of the Benchmark Indicator, that limits to 20% the exposure of each component andwhose calculation is carried out by the sponsor or the calculation agent of the Benchmark Indicator. This 20% limit canbe increased to 35% for a single component when this proves to be justified by exceptional conditions within themarket, notably when certain securities are heavily dominant and/or in case of high volatility of the price of futurescontracts on a component represented in the Benchmark Indicator. It could be the case after an unfavourable evolutionof climatic or economic conditions that have a negative impact on the quantities available of a component representedin the Benchmark Indicator or of any other event affecting the liquidities of one of the futures contracts comprising theBenchmark Indicator.
As the Benchmark Indicator‘s calculation methodology is not based on a direct investment in commodities, but ratheron an indirect investment via futures contracts, the MF’s performance will be impacted by the cost related to therenewal (“Roll”) of the aforesaid futures on a monthly basis.
This phenomenon could negatively and progressively impact, potentially in a signiﬁcant manner, the gap between theMF’s performance and the gross performance of the underlyings of the aforesaid futures, notably in case of long-terminvestment in the MF’s units.
2. Balance sheet assets {excluding integrated derivatives!
In compliance with the ratios included in the regulations, the MF can hold international equities (from all economicsectors, listed on all markets), including within the small cap markets,
The aforementioned equities will be chosen on the basis of criteria: of eligibility, in particular:
0 Subordination t0 the main market indices
0 Liquidity (minimal thresholds applied to mean daily volumes of transactions and to the equity market capitalisation)- Rating of the country of the issuer’s head office (requirement of a minimal threshold in S&P rating or equivalent)
- Of diversification, in particular:
0 Issuer (application of ratios applicable to the eligible assets of an UCITS, as speciﬁed in Art. R214-21 of the[French] Monetary and Financial Code)
0 Geographical area0 Sector
For more information on the abovementioned eligibility and diversiﬁcation criteria, in particular the list of the eligibleindices, investors can Visit the following Internet site: www.lyxoretf.com.
For up to 10% of its net assets, the MF can invest in the assets of the undertakings for collective investment intransferable securities (“UCITS) that comply with Directive 2009/65/EC, As part of these investments, the MF cansubscribe to units or equities 0f UCITS managed by the management company, or a company with which it is linked,The manager will not invest in units or equities of AIF or other investment funds established on the basis of foreignlaws as indicated in article R214-l3 0f the Monetary and Financial Code,

When the MF receives securities as guarantee under the conditions and limits of this section’s paragraph 8 below, theywill also constitute balance sheet assets received in full ownership by the MF, given that they are received by the MF infull ownership.
As part of the future optimisation of the MF’s management, the manager reserves the right to use other instrumentswithin the limits of the regulations in order to achieve the management objective
3. Off—balance sheet assets gderivative instruments!
The MP will use IndeX-linked swaps traded over the counter, thereby swapping the value of the MF's assets against thevalue of the Benchmark Indicator (in compliance with the description contained in this section's paragraph 1 above)
- Maximum proportion of assets under management which may be the object of a Total Return Swap (TRS): 100% ofthe assets under management
— Expected proportion of assets under management which may be the object of a Total Return Swap (TRS): up to 100%of the assets under management
As part of a future optimisation of the MF management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments withinthe limits of the regulations, such as to reach the management objective, for example including future ﬁnancialinstruments other than index-linked swaps
In compliance with its best execution policy, the management company considers that the Société Generale is thecounterparty that generally makes it possible to obtain the best possible result with these future ﬁnancial instruments,These future financial instruments (including index-linked swaps) can therefore be negotiated with the SociétéGénérale, without prior open competition involving several counterparties,
The counterparty 0f the aforesaid future ﬁnancial instruments (the “‘Counterparty”) will have no discretionary powerregarding the composition of the MF’s investment portfolio, nor regarding the underlying assets of the future financialinstruments,
4. Securities with integrated derivativesNone.
5. DepositsUp to 20% of its net assets, the MF can have recourse to deposits with lending institutions belonging to the same groupas the depositary in order to optimise its cash management.
6. Cash borrowingUp to 10% of its net assets, the MF may temporarily have recourse to borrowings.
7. Temporag securities acquisition and sale operationsNone. The manager will not have recourse to temporary securities acquisition and/or sale operations.
8. Financial guarantees
In all cases in which the MF is subject to a counterparty risk as a result of the deployed investment strategy, notably inthe event of the MF’s use of forward swap contracts traded over the counter, the MF can receive securities that areconsidered as guarantees in order to reduce the counterparty risk related to these operations. The portfolio of receivedguarantees can be adjusted each day in order for its value to be greater than 01' equal to the level of the counterparty riskborne by the MF in most cases, The objective of this adjustment will be to ensure that the level of counterparty riskborne by the MF is totally neutralized,
Any financial guarantee received by the MF will be provided to the MF in full ownership and listed in the MF’s accountopened in the books of its depositary. As such, the received ﬁnancial guarantees will be listed amongst the MF’s assets.
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF within this framework must comply with the criteria deﬁned by theprevailing laws and regulations, notably in terms of liquidity, valuation, credit quality of the issuers, correlation, risksrelated to the management of securities, and applicability. The received guarantees must, in particular, comply with thefollowing conditions:
(a) Any received guarantee must be of high quality, very liquid and traded on a regulated market or in a multilateraltrading system with transparent pricing, in order to be sold quickly at a price close to the prior valuation;(b) They must be valued at the mark-to-market price at least on a daily basis and assets showing strong price volatilitymust not be accepted as a guarantee except in case of the application of a sufficiently cautious discount;
(c) They must be issued by an entity that is independent of the counterparty and must not be highly correlated with thecounterparty’ s performances;
(d) They must be sufficiently diversified in terms of countries, markets and issuers, with a maximum exposure perissuer of 20% of the MF’s net asset value;
(e) The MF’s Management Company must be able to fully realise them at any time, without consultation with thecounterparty nor approval of the latter.

Policy related to discountsThe MF’s management company will apply a margin to the financial guarantees received by the MP. The appliedmargins will notably depend on the following criteria:
— Nature of the asset received as guarantee;
— Maturity of the asset received as guarantee (if applicable);
— Rating of the issuer of the asset received as guarantee (if applicable).
Reinvestment of received guarantees
Financial guarantees received in a non-cash form shall not be sold, reinvested 0r pledged,Guarantees received in cash shall, at the discretion of the manager, be either:

(iv) invested in short—term money mutual funds, as they are deﬁned in the guidelines for a common definition ofEuropean money mutual funds,
Reinvested cash financial guarantees must be diversified, in compliance with the applicable requirements for non—cashﬁnancial guarantees.
Risk proﬁle
The bearer’s money will primarily be invested in financial instruments selected by the management company. Theseinstruments will be subject to the vagaries ofthe markets.
Through the MF, the bearer is primarily exposed to the following risks:- Risk linked to the investment in commodities
The commodity markets are decorrelated from the traditional markets, As the underlying index is calculated on thebasis of commodity futures contracts, the investor is exposed to a liquidity risk involving these instruments. An indexcalculated on the basis of futures contracts can notably be affected by the rollover cost when these futures contractscome to maturity. The price variation of a commodity futures contract and its rollover costs notably reﬂect (but withoutbeing limited to): price changes of the underlying commodity, its current and estimated production, the estimated levelof essential reserves, the climatic and geopolitical environment, its storage and transportation cost.
- Capital loss risk
The invested capital is not guaranteed The investor consequently runs the risk of capital loss. The entire or part of theinvested amount may not be recovered, notably should the performance of the Benchmark Indicator be negative overthe investment periodi

===================================================
8.hocr: 
LYXOR COMMODITIES THOMSON REUTERS/CORECOMMODITY CRB TR UCITS ETF

- Liquidity risk (primary market)
If, when the MF (or one of its counterparties for Future Financial Instrument (“FFI”)) adjust its exposure, the marketsrelated to this exposure are then limited, closed or subject to significant purchase / sale price discrepancies, the valueand/or liquidity of the MF could be negatively affected. Should low volumes of exchanges result in an inability to carryout transactions linked to the replication of the Benchmark Indicator, this can also have consequences on the processesrelated to the subscription, conversion or redemption of units.
- Liquidity risk on a place of listing
The MF’s equity price can deviate from its indicative net asset value. The liquidity of the MF’s units or equities on aplace of listing can be affected by any suspension that could notably be due to:
i) suspension or stoppage 0f the calculation of the Benchmark Indicator, and/or
ii) suspension of the market(s) 0f the underlyings used of the Benchmark Indicator, and/or
iii) the impossibility for a given place of listing to obtain or calculate the MF's indicative net asset value, and/oriv) a market maker’s Violation of the rules applicable to this marketplace, and/or
V) a failure of this marketplace's IT or electronic systems.
- Counterparty risk
The MP is exposed to the risk of bankruptcy, payment default or any other type of default of any counterparty withwhich it has entered into a contract or transaction. It is particularly exposed to the counterparty risk resulting from itsuse of Future Financial Instruments (“FFI) traded over-the-counter with Societe Générale or with any othercounterparty. In compliance with the UCITS regulations, the counterparty risk (whether this counterparty is the SociétéGénérale or any other entity) cannot exceed 10% 0f the total value of the MF’s assets by counterparty.
In case of a Counterparty’s default, the contract relating to FFIs can be terminated early. The MF will then make everyeffort to achieve its management objective by signing, if relevant, another contract relating to FFIs with a third partycounterparty, under the market conditions prevailing at the time of the occurrence of this event.
The realisation of this risk can notably have impacts on the MF’s ability to achieve its management objective, inparticular the replication of the Benchmark Indicator.
When Société Générale is involved as a counterparty 0f the FFIs, conﬂicts of interest can arise between the MF’sManagement Company and the FFI’s counterparty. The Management Company manages these conﬂict of interest risksby setting up procedures intended to identify and limit them, and to ensure their equitable resolution, if relevant,
- Roll risk on futures
As the Benchmark Indicator is made up of “future” type contracts on commodities, a monthly “Roll” of the futurespositions is necessary in order to maintain the exposure: rolling futures contracts involves transferring a position withfutures maturing in the near future (in any event, before the expiry of the futures contracts) to futures with a longermaturity,
The investor is exposed to a risk of loss or gain when futures are rolled over. In certain market configurations, thisphenomenon could result in a systematic loss at the time of the monthly rollovers, and thus negatively and progressivelyimpact, potentially in a significant manner, the gap between the MF’s performance and the gross performance of theshort positions on the underlyings 0f the aforesaid futures, notably in case of long-term investment in the MF’s units.
- Risk that the management objective may only be partially reached
Nothing guarantees that the management objective will be reached. Indeed, [to asset or financial instrument will allowan automatic and continuous replication of the Benchmark Indicator, notably should one or more of the following risksarise:
- Risk related to the use of derivative instruments
In order to reach its investment objective, the MF uses “FFI traded over-the-counter, that can notably take the form ofswap contracts that will allow it to obtain the performance of the Benchmark Indicator. These FFIs can result in a seriesof risks on the level of the FFIs that notably include: counterparty risk, event affecting the hedging, event affecting theBenchmark Indicator, risk related to the tax regime, risk related to the regulations, operational risk and liquidity risk.These risks can directly affect a FFI and can result in the adjustment and/or early termination of the FFI transaction,which could affect the MF’s net asset value
- Legal risk
The mutual fund may bear a legal risk related to the conclusion of any Total Return Swap contract (TRS) as laid downin Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.
- Risk related to a change of the tax regime
Any change to the tax legislation in any country in which the MP is established, authorised for marketing or listed canaffect the tax treatment of the investors In this case, the MF’s manager assumes no liability relative to investors withregard to the payments having to be made to any competent tax authorityi

- Risk related to a change of the tax regime affecting the underlyings
Any change of the tax legislation applicable to the MF’s underlyings can affect the MF‘s tax treatment. Consequently,in case of divergence between the anticipated tax treatment and the one actually applied to the MF (and/or to itscounterparty in the FFI), the MF’s net asset value may be affected.
- Risk related to regulations
In case of change of the regulations in any country in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing or listed,the processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units may be affected.
- Risk related to regulations applicable to the underlyings
In ease of change of the regulations applicable to the MF's underlyings, the MF's net asset value can be affected, as canthe processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units,
- Risk related to events affecting the Benchmark Indicator
In case of events affecting the Benchmark Indicator, the manager may, under the conditions and limits of the applicablelegislation, have to suspend the subscription and redemption of MF units. The calculation of the MF’s net asset valuecan also be affected.
If the event persists, the MF’s manager will decide on measures having to be adopted, which can have an impact on theMF’s net asset value. “Events affecting the Benchmark Indicator” are understood to mean the following situations:
1) the Benchmark Indicator is considered to be incorrect or not reﬂective of the market‘s actual evolution,ii) the Benchmark Indicator is deﬁnitively discontinued by its supplier,iii) the supplier of the index is incapable of providing the level or value of the said Benchmark Indicator,
iv) the supplier of the index makes a signiﬁcant change to its formula or calculation method (other than a minormodiﬁcation such as the adjustment of the underlyings used with this Benchmark Indicator or of the respectiveweightings between its various components), that cannot be effectively replicated by the MF at a reasonable cost,
V) One or more components of the Benchmark Indicator becomes n0n»liquid, with the listing being suspended on anorganised market, or components traded over-the-counter (such as bonds, for example) become n0n»liquid,
vi) The Benchmark Indicator‘s components are impacted by transaction costs relative to the execution, delivery versuspayment or specific ﬁscal constraints, without these costs being reﬂected in the Benchmark Indicator’s performance.
- Securities transaction risk
Should the issuer of a security underlying the Benchmark Indicator undertake an unanticipated review of a securitiestransaction (“ST), that contradicts a prior and official announcement that had resulted in a valuation of the ST by theMF (and/or in a valuation of the ST by the MF’s counterparty in a future ﬁnancial instrument), the MF’s net asset valuemay be affected, notably should the actual treatment of the ST by the MF differ from the ST’s treatment in themethodology used by the Benchmark Indicator.
- Exchange risk linked to the class of units C-EUR (EUR/USD)The abovementioned Class of units is exposed to an exchange risk to the extent that it is listed in a currency other than
that of the Benchmark Indicator. The net asset value of the abovementioned class of units can therefore decrease due toﬂuctuating exchange rates even though the value of the Benchmark Indicator has increased,
Eligible subscribers and typical investor profileThe MF is open to any subscriber.
An investor subscribing to this MF wishes to obtain an exposure to the commodities market and, more specifically, tothe performance of the main commodities markets, namely: energy, metals and agricultural products (softs).
The amount that it is reasonable to invest in this MF depends on the personal situation of each investor.
