10. Earnings per share
(a)
Basic earnings ger share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit attributable to equity holders of theCompany by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial year.
The Groug2017 2016Net profit attributable to equity holders of the Company ($000) 153,745 28,962Weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding forbasic earnings per share (’000) 578,661 576,936Basic earnings per share (cents per share) 26.57 502

Diluted earnings Ber share
For the purpose of calculating diluted earnings per share, profit attributable to equity holders of theCompany and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding are adjusted for the effects ofall dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Company has one category of dilutive potential ordinary sharesunder a share award plan described in Note 26.
The assumed issue price of the shares under the share grant is the fair value of the shares at grant datefor non»cash consideration in the form of services rendered by the grantees (mainly employees) to theGroup over the vesting periods of one, two and three years in three equal trenches. It is assumed thatthe Group receives this consideration progressively from the grant date to the vesting date, over whichit builds up a share-based payment reserve while recognising the additional employee compensationexpense through an amortisation process At 31 December 2017, the unamortised amount whichrepresents the services yet to be received is assumed to be the remaining proceeds to be received for thenumber of shares granted, As the number of shares to be issued under the share grant is greater than thenumber of shares which would have been issued at fair value (the average market price for the financialyear) for the remaining proceeds, the difference is the number of shares issued for no considerationwhich dilutes the earnings per share. The number of shares issued for no consideration is added to theweighted average number of shares outstanding during the financial year to arrive at a larger number ofshares to calculate the diluted earnings per share, with the same net profit.

There was no change to the valuation technique used to determine the fair value of each investment property.The main Level 8 valuation techniques and inputs used are as follows:Adjusted sales comparison approach
The key unobsen/able input used is the transacted prices per square metre of comparable properties in closeproximity based on recent market transactions. These recent transacted prices are subsequently adjusted toconsider the size of the Group‘s and Company's property, the age of the building, the remaining tenure ofthe property and/or the plot ratio of the land relative to those of the comparable properties sold to derive thefair value of the Group’s and Company’s property. An increase in transacted prices per square metre wouldincrease the valuation.
Income capitalisation approach
Under this approach, the estimated net income on a fully leased property is capitalised over the remainingterm of the lease from the valuation date at an appropriate capitalisation rate. The key unobservable inputsare the estimated market rental rate per square metre and capitalisation rate. Market rental rate is estimatedconsidering the estimated rental value of the property under existing market conditions and if any, existing leaseagreements on the property. The market rental rate is adjusted to reflect anticipated operating costs to derive atthe estimated net income. The Group‘s properties which have existing lease agreements and are valued underthis approach have a weighted average rental per annum of $67 (2016: $111) per square metre. Capitalisationrate, estimated at 3.0% to 90% (2016: 30% to 90%), is the rate of return on the property considering marketconditions on the valuation date and the profile of the property. An increase in estimated market rental rate persquare metre would increase the valuation while an increase in capitalisation rate would lower the valuation
Depreciated replacement cost method
The key unobservable inputs of this method are construction cost per square metre and where applicable,estimated cost to complete per square metre. Construction cost and estimated cost to complete are estimatedby the valuer based on market construction rates for similar properties as at the date of valuation A depreciationfactor is then applied to the total estimated construction costs to reflect the remaining economic life of theproperty in deriving its fair value. An increase in construction cost or estimated cost to complete per squaremetre would increase the valuation.

The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concernand to maintain an optimal capital structure so as to maximise shareholders’ value. In order to maintainor achieve an optimal capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividend payment, returncapital to shareholders, issue new shares, buy back issued shares, obtain new borrowings or sell assetsto reduce borrowings.
Management monitors capital based on a gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net debt divided bytotal capital employed. Net debt is calculated as borrowings plus trade and other payables less cashand cash equivalents. Where cash holding exceeds net debt, net debt is considered zero and henceno gearing. Total capital employed is calculated as equity plus net debt. There were no changes in theGroup’s approach to capital management during the year.

(i) Cumulative translation differences
The Group plans to elect to set the cumulative foreign currency translation differences for all foreignoperations to be zero as at the date of transition to SFRSG) on 1 January 2017. As a result, foreigncurrency translation reserve and retained profits as at 1 January 2017 and 31 December 2017 willbe reduced/increased by $51,629,000 respectively.
(b) Adoption of SFRSlI) equivalent of IFRS 9

Applicable to 2019 ﬁnancial statementsSFRS(I) 16 Leases
SFRSU) 16 eliminates the lessee’s classification of leases as either operating leases or finance leases andintroduces a single lessee accounting model. Applying the new model, a lessee is required to recognise right-of-use (“ROU”) assets and lease liabilities for all leases with a term of more than 12 months, unless the underlyingasset is of low value.
SFRSU) 16 substantially carries forward the lessor accounting requirements in FRS 17 Leases. Accordingly,a lessor continues to classify its leases as operating leases or finance leases. and to account for these twotypes of leases using the FRS 17 operating lease and finance lease accounting models respectively. However,SFRSU) 16 requires more extensive disclosures to be provided by a lessor.
When effective, SFRSU) 16 replaces existing lease accounting guidance, including FRS 17, INT FRS 104Determining whether an Arrangement contains a Lease; INT FRS 15 Operating Leases-Incentives; and INT
FRS 27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Involving the Legal Form of a Lease.
Potential impact on the financial statements

The standard will affect primarily the accounting for the Group’s operating leases, As at the reporting date. theGroup has non-cancellable operating lease commitments of $9,583,000 (Note 30(a)). However. the Group isin the process of evaluating to what extent these commitments will result in the recognition of an asset and aliability for future payments and how this will affect the Group’s profit or loss and classification of cash flows.Some of the commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and Iow-value leases and somecommitments may relate to arrangements that will not qualify as leases under SFRS(|) 16.
The Group plans to adopt the standard when it becomes effective in 2019. The Group will perform a detailedanalysis of the standard, including the transition options and practical expedients in 2018.37. Authorisation of financial statements
These financial statements were authorised for issue in accordance with a resolution of the Board of Directorsof Yeo Hiap Seng Limited on 23 February 2018.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
A description of the background of each Director is provided in the “Profile of the Board of Directors & Managementsection of the Annual Report.
Number of independent Directors on the Board
The Chairman of the Board, Mr. Koh Boon Hwee, is a non-independent and non—executive Director‘ The Boardcomprises a majority of independent Directors, which satisfies the Code’s requirement that independent Directorsshould make up at least half of the Board where the Chairman of the Board is not an independent Director.
Independence of Directors
The Board has adopted the definition in the Code of what constitutes an independent Director in its review of theindependence of each Director and reviews annually (and as and when circumstances require) the independence ofthe independent Directors.
Annually, the independent Directors submit declarations on their independence to the NC for assessment. The NC, in itsdeliberation as to the independence of a Director and taking into account examples of relationships as stipulated in theCode, considers whether a Director has or had any relationships with the Group, and if so, whether such relationshipscould interfere, or be reasonably perceived to interfere, with the exercise of the Director’s independent judgement. TheNC noted that no material relationships (including familial relationships) exist between each independent Director andthe other Board members, the Company or its 10% shareholders (as defined in the Code).
For the financial year under review, the NC, having reviewed the independence of the relevant Directors in accordancewith the preceding paragraph, is satisfied that there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affectthe following independent Directors’ objective and independent judgement:
i. Dato’ Mohamed Nizam bin Abdul Razakz;
iii Dato’ N. Sadasivan a/I N.N. Pillayz; and
iii. Ms. Luo Dang.
Accordingly, the Board has, upon the NOS recommendation, affirmed that the abovenamed Directors, each of whomhas served less than nine years as independent Directors, remains independent as contemplated by the Code.
Independence of Directors who have served on the Board beyond nine yearsThe provisions of the Code require the Board to review with particular rigor whether an independent Director who hasserved for a period of more than nine years as a Director continues to be independent.
The following Directors have each served as an independent Director for more than nine years from the date of theirfirst appointment to the Board:
i, Mr, S. Chandra Dasz;ii. Mr. Chin Yoke Choongz; and
iii. Dr. Tan Chin Namz.
2 Independent Director since date of appointment to the Board.
===================================================
21.hocr: 
VEO HIAP SENG LIMITED
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The Board is of the view that an individual’s independence cannot be determined arbitrarily on the basis of a set periodof time. The NC and Board, having rigorously reviewed whether there are relationships or circumstances which areikely to affect, or could appear to affect the judgement and the independence of the above Directors, noted the aboveDirectors‘ active participation in debating, questioning and evaluating proposals by management and/or actions taken.Accordingly, the Board has determined that Mr. Das, Mr. Chin and Dr. Tan are independent as they have continued0 demonstrate independence in character and judgement in the discharge of their responsibilities as Directors andhere are no relationships or circumstances which affect or are likely to affect their judgement and ability to dischargetheir responsibilities as independent Directors.
Size, composition and competencies of the Board and Board committees
he size and composition of the Board and Board committees and the skills and core competencies of its membersare reviewed annually by the NC, which seeks to ensure that the size and composition of the Board is conducive foreffective discussion and decision making, and that the Board has an appropriate number of independent Directors.
“aking into account the size and geographical spread of the Group’s businesses, the Board considers the currentBoard size as appropriate for meaningful individual participation by Directors with diverse professional perspectives,so as to facilitate efficient and effective decision making with a strong independent element.

“he current Board comprises members who as a group provide core competencies necessary to meet the Group’sneeds. These competencies include accounting and finance, banking, business acumen, industry knowledge andmanagement experience.
Annually, the NC reviews the diversity of skills, qualities and experiences that the Board requires to function competentlyand efficiently, based on an established competency matrix of the Board and the curriculum vitae submitted by theindividual Directors. As each Director brings valuable insights from various professional fields that are vital to thestrategic interests of the Company, the Board considers that the Directors possess the necessary competenciesto provide management with diverse and objective perspectives on issues so as to lead and govern the Companyefficaciously.
The Board also recognises the importance of gender diversity and endeavours to include female candidates in its searchpool for new appointments. Ms. Luo Dan was appointed as a Board member on 1 January 2017 and as a member ofthe RC on 27 April 2017. The incumbent Board comprises eight male Directors and one female Director.
Role of non-executive Directors
The non-executive Directors (inclusive of independent Directors) engaged with management in the annual budgetplanning process. They also constructively challenged management and helped to develop proposals on strategy. Ona quarterly basis, the non-executive Directors reviewed the performance of management in meeting agreed goals andobjectives and monitored the reporting of performance against budget, peer performance and a balanced scorecardcomprising key financial and non-financial performance indicators.
Meeting of Directors without executive Director and managementAs and when warranted, the Board sets aside time to meet without the presence of the executive Director andmanagement The Board is hence of the view that it is not necessary to prearrange formal sessions.
Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
Principle 3 There should be a clear division of responsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executivesresponsible for managing the company’s business. No one individual should represent a considerableconcentration of power.
Separation of the role of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The offices of Chairman of the Board and CEO are held by separate individuals to maintain effective oversight andaccountability at Board and management levels. As Chairman of the Board, Mr. Koh Boon Hwee bears responsibilityfor the workings of the Board. Mr‘ Melvin Teo Tzai Win, as Group CEO, bears responsibility for overall running of theGroup's businesses.
There is no familial relationship between the Chairman, Mr. Koh and the Group CEO, Mr. Teo.

Taking cognisance that the Chairman of the Board is not an independent Director, the Board has appointed Mr. S.Chandra Das as lead independent Director on 1 November 2005 to serve as a sounding board for the Chairman ofthe Board and also act as an intermediary between the non-executive Directors and the Chairman‘
Shareholders with concerns may contact the lead independent Director, Mr. Das, directly, when contact through thenormal channels via the Chairman or other management personnel has failed to provide satisfactory resolution, orwhen such contact is inappropriate.
Periodic meetings of independent Directors
The lead independent Director proposes and leads meetings of the independent Directors without the presence of theChairman and non-independent Directors as and when warranted. The lead independent Director will provide feedbackto the Chairman after the conclusion of such meetings.
Board MembershipPrinciple 4 There should be a formal and transparent process for the appointment and re-appointment of directorsto the Board.
NC composition and role
The NC comprises three Directors, namely, Mr. S. Chandra Das (Chairman of NC and lead independent Director),Mr. Chin Yoke Choong (NC member since 27 April 2017) and Dr. Tan Chin Nam (NC member since 27 April 2017). Allthree members are independent Directors.

iv. training and professional development programmes for the Board; and
v. nominations of candidates for the appointment or re-appointment of members of the Board of Directors and themembers of the various Board committees.
During the financial year under review, the NC held one scheduled meeting.
Progressive renewal of the Board
Periodic reviews of the Board composition, including the selection of candidates for new appointments to the Board,are made by the NC in consultation with the Chairman as part of the Board's renewal process. Candidates will beconsidered against objective criteria, having due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, including gender.The selection of candidates is evaluated taking into account various factors including the current and mid»term needsand objectives of the Group, as well as the relevant expertise of the candidates and their potential contributions.Candidates may be put forward or sought through contacts and recommendations. In support of the renewal of theBoard composition, three non-exeoutive Directors stepped down from the Board and two new non-executive Directorsjoined the Board during the financial year under review.
At each AGM. one third of the Directors, including the Group CEO who also serves on the Board (or, if their numberis not a multiple of three, the number nearest to but not less than one-third), shall retire from office by rotation inaccordance with the Constitution, and may stand for re-election. Directors appointed by the Board during the financialyear, without shareholders‘ approval at the AGM. shall only hold office until the next AGM, and thereafter be eligiblefor re—election at the AGM. They are not counted in the number of Directors to retire by rotation at the AGM. The NCconsiders the present guidelines adequate and does not recommend any change.
The NC takes into consideration for the re-nomination of Directors for the ensuing term of office factors such asattendance, preparedness, participation and candour at meetings of the Board and Board committees All Directorsare required to submit themselves for re»nomination at regular intervals and at least once every three years.
NC to determine Directors’ independence
The NC deliberates annually to determine the independence of a Director bearing in mind the guidelines set out in theCode as well as all other relevant circumstances. No member of the NC participated in the deliberation process inrespect of his own status as an independent Director.
Directors’ time commitments
The responsibilities of the NC also include assessing annually whether Directors who hold multiple directorshipsadequately carry out their duties as Directors of the Company The N03 assessments are based on Directors’declarations made annually and from time to time.
The Code recommends that the Board consider providing guidance on the maximum number of listed company boardrepresentations which each Director of the Company may hold in order to address competing time commitments facedby Directors serving on multiple boards.
The Board considers an assessment of the individual Director’s contribution at meetings to be more effective thanprescribing a numerical limit on the number of listed company board seats which a Director may hold. In this respect,the Board has accordingly not set a maximum number of other company directorships which a Director may concurrentlyhold, taking into consideration that multiple representations can benefit the Group as these Directors bring to the Boardgreater depth and diversity of experience, knowledge and perspectives.
For the financial year under review, the NC is satisfied that all Directors on the Board have extensive management,financial, accounting, banking, investment and commercial backgrounds, who are capable of acting responsibly and areable to properly serve on the Board and any of the Board committees to which such Directors are appointed despitecompeting commitments and demands on their time.

Board PerformancePrinciple 5 There should be a formal annual assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and its boardcommittees and the contribution by each director to the effectiveness of the Board.
Board evaluation process
While the Code recommends the assessment of the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and also the individualcontribution by each Director to the effectiveness of the Board, the NC is of the view that it is more appropriate andeffective for the Board to be evaluated as a whole, bearing in mind that each member of the Board contributes invarious ways to the success of the Company and Board decisions are made collectivelyt
The NC has put in place a formal Board evaluation process to evaluate the performance of the Board as a whole and itsability to discharge its responsibilities in providing stewardship, corporate governance and overseeing of management'sperformance. To facilitate the evaluation process, Directors are requested to complete evaluation questionnaires annuallywhich assess the effectiveness of the Board and the Chairman of the Board, To ensure confidentiality, the evaluationquestionnaires completed by the Directors are submitted to the Company Secretary for collation, and the consolidatedresponses are presented to the NC for review. The results of the performance evaluation are then presented first to theChairman and then to the Board for consideration. The Board will then act on the results where appropriate.
Following the evaluation for the financial year under review, the Board is of the view that the Board operates effectivelyand each Director has contributed to the overall effectiveness of the Board in meeting performance objectives.

Board evaluation criteria
To assess the Board’s performance, the NC has established a set of assessment criteria such as the size of theBoard, the degree of independence of the Board, information flow from management, and adequacy of the Board andcommittees’ meetings held to enable proper consideration of issues. This set of assessment criteria is the same asthat used during the financial year ended 31 December 2016.
Annually, members of the Board are required to assess the Board by completing a Board Evaluation Questionnairecomprising the following performance criteria as recommended by the NC and approved by the Board:
(a) Board Composition;(b) Board Information;(0) Board Process; and(d) Board Accountability.
The above performance criteria will be reviewed by the NC and the Board from time to time, where appropriate.The Board is of the opinion that a criterion such as share price performance is not appropriate for assessment ofnon-executive Directors’ and the Board’s performance as a whole.
Evaluation of individual DirectorsAlthough the Directors are not evaluated individually, factors such as Directors’ contribution, participation in discussionsand commitment of their time to their role have been considered during the Board renewal process.
Other factors taken into consideration by the NC also include the value of contribution to the development of strategy,availability at Board meetings (as well as informal contribution via electronic mail and telephone), degree of preparedness,industry and business knowledge and experience each director possesses which are crucial to the Group’s business.
For the year under review, the Board is of the view that the members of the Board have performed efficiently andeffectively for the Board to function collectively as a whole.

Any material variancebetween budgets, projections and actual results are disclosed and explained. All relevant information on material eventsand transactions are circulated to Directors as and when they arise.
Provision of information to the Board

With this process, the Company steers itself towards sustaininga green and environmentally-friendly work culture.
Company Secretary
Board members have separate and independent access to the Company’s senior management and the CompanySecretary, and vice versa. Such access comes in the form of electronic mail, telephone and face-to-face meetings.The Company Secretary attends all meetings of the Board and Board committees and assists the Chairman to ensurethat Board procedures are followed and that there is good information flow within the Board and the Board committeesand between management and non-executive Directors.

PROTECTING OUR ENVIRONME T
Our management philosophy is to adopt a precautionaryapproach to environmental challenges by addressingmaterial environmental risks and impacts on ouroperations. We recognise that we cannot do this alone,and will leverage the strength of partnerships andcollaborations with key agencies in tackling this issue.
WATER MANAGEMENT
According to the UN Sustainable Development GoalsReport 2017, more than 2 billion people across the worldlive in water stressed levels of over 60%. With a growingglobal population and if water consen/ation is ignored, theissue of water scarcity is very likely to impact our local andregional operations.
In Singapore where it has always been reliant onimported water, plans have been laid down to ensurethat the country can be seIf-reliant in water by 2061.The country has also been increasing its size of localwater catchment area and building up supply fromnon-conventional sources. To control excessive waterusage, the government has also announced water taxhikes.
Malaysia is located in a humid tropical area rich in waterresources. Nonetheless, seasonal rainfall and unevenrainfall between areas in the country affect the consistencyof supply in different areas while decreasing quality ofriver water is also becoming a concern. As such, it isnot uncommon for certain Malaysian states to, at times,implement water»rationing measures when they facesevere water shortages.
Clean potable water is a vital ingredient in our productionprocess and it is imperative that we do our part in pursinga more efficient use of water and innovating in ways ofrecycling. By implementing water saving technologies, westrive to be able to lead the industry in evolving the wayfood and beverages can be produced.
CONSERVATION AND RECYCLING
Water usage is the highest in the production function inour business and the aggregate production capacity ofSingapore and Malaysia factories forms more than 90% ofthe Group’s.
We currently reduce our water footprint by puttingrecycled water to alternative uses.
To further reduce our water usage in Singapore, we aresetting up a water recycling plant at our Senoko facton/in Singapore. This is done in collaboration with thenation's Public Utilities Board and Nanyang TechnologicalUniversity (“NTU”) as its research partner.
The research phase of the project has been completedwith technical designs from NTU. The project is currentlyon track for completion in 2018/2019.
The proposed water recycling plant in Singapore isexpected to recycle a substantial portion of the wastewatercollected from the production process which can be usedfor cooling, steam generation, washing and other industrialnon-production processes. As a result, we believe thatthe project will help to considerably lower our waterfootprint and environmental impact, and underscoresour continuous investment in implementing water savingtechnologies.

Linked to our goal of water conservation is that ofreducing and managing waste, as improper disposal couldalso lead to pollution of clean water sources, amongstother environmental damages.
In our operations, waste management efforts are focusedon the by-products generated by the manufacturingprocess in our factories.
OUR APPROACH
Soya pulp residue, also known as okara, is a byproductfrom our soy milk production. Traditionally disposed inthe landfills, okara can also be used as animal feed or asnatural fertilisers.
Currently, our okara waste from the Malaysia factories aresold off as animal feed to the farms in the vicinity. In theSingapore factory, we dispose it to an offtaker who usesthe by-product as fertilisers while maintaining dialogueswith agencies to explore alternative usage for okara.

AND OPERATIONS REVIEW
DEAR SHAREHOLDERS
FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our business and financial performance in 2017 reflectedthe weak consumer sentiments in our core markets. TheGroup's revenue decreased 16.9% to $340.7 million,mainly due to dampened market sentiments, competitivepricing and sales disruption in Cambodia Our net profitreceived a one-time $138.4 million boost from the sale ofinvestment in Super Group Limited, bringing the Group’snet profit to $153.7 million.
To better extract value, we focused our marketingefforts on promoting our new range of food andbeverage products, and through continuous corporateimprovements and cost management, we reduced ouroperating expenses by $28.2 million.
The Group‘s balance sheet remained healthy withcash and cash equivalents of $2948 million and noborrowings as at 31 December 2017. The proceedsfrom the disposal of Super Group Limited will provide theGroup with stronger capability to grow through strategiccollaborations or acquisitions when the opportunitiesarise. As a start, we invested in Nissin Foods CompanyLimited during its Hong Kong initial public offering inDecember 2017 as a cornerstone investor and starteddiscussions on collaboration opportunities.
PAVING FOR GROWTH
As we execute our three-pronged strategy to rejuvenateour brand; grow our food business; and develop ouragency business, the Group continues to launch newproducts from both Yeo’s and those of agency brands.This momentum for new offerings is required to maintainan attractive portfolio and to stay relevant to the evolvingand rapidly changing consumer tastes.
During the year, we launched the Snow ChwsanthemumTea as a premium addition to our Asian Drinks portfolio.
In order to cater to the premium water segment, welaunched our Pureté branded natural mineral water whichis sourced from Fonte Tavina in the Italian Alps‘ Breakinginto the Ready-To-Drink (RTD) tea and coffee categories,we launched our Justea and Juscoffee range We alsoexpanded our Fun series with the addition of Fun ZestyCitrus Drink and Fun Lemon Lime Twist Drink.
In the food segment, we launched our Yeo’s ChickenRendang, Yeo‘s Chilli Sauce and Yeo‘s Tomato Sauce.These new products will enhance the growth traction ofour food business strategy.
We will build on our extensive sales and distributionworkforce to take on more agency partners and products.In 2017, we began distributing products from well-knownbrands like Allswell, Red Bull, Budweiser, Corona andBeck’s. We are also distributing Yami fruit drinks inMalaysia, which are developed together with our jointventure partner, Hui Yuan.
As a pioneer in offering products in ‘less sweet'alternatives, we have been mindful of the consumers’increasing focus on health and wellness as well as anincreasing preference for lower sugar products‘ Currently,60% of our product volume are endorsed with theHealthier Choice Symbol (H08) and less than 1% ofour range are above the 12% sugar level. We havecollaborated with the Singapore Health Promotion Boardto develop products with lower sugar content and arealso in the midst of reformulating products that are above12% sugar level to bring their sugar content down. We areconstantly innovating to ensure that lower sugar productsstill taste great so that our consumers continue to havean enjoyable experience with our drinks.

TO THE MEMBERS OF YEO HIAP SENG LIMITED
Report on the Audit of the Financial StatementsOpinion
We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Yeo Hiap Seng Limited (the “Company) and its subsidiaries (the“Group) which comprise the consolidated balance sheet of the Group and the balance sheet of the Company as at31 December 2017, the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equityand consolidated statement of cash flows of the Group for the financial year then ended, and notes to the financialstatements, including a summary of significant accounting policies, as set out on pages 71 to 148.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the balance sheet of the Companyare properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Singapore Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the “Act) andFinancial Reporting Standards in Singapore (“FRSS”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidated financialposition of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and of the consolidatedfinancial performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group for the financial yearended on that date.
Basis for opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under thosestandards are further described in the ”Auditors' responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements section ofour report. We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatow AuthorityCode of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code) together withthe ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilledour other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the auditevidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key audit mattersKey audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the
financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financialstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.

Valuation of Investment PropertiesRefer to note 2.5 and note 20 to the financial statements
The key audit matter
The Group’s investment properties are accounted for atfair value and amounted to $54.1 million, which represents7.3% of the Group’s total assets as at 31 December 2017.The net fair value gains on investment properties amountedto $9.9 million for the year ended 31 December 2017.
The Group engaged external valuers to value its propertieslocated in Malaysia, China and the United States ofAmerica. In determining the fair value, the external valuersmake a number of key estimates and assumptions,in particular assumptions in relation to forecastedrental rates, real estate sales prices and capitalisationrates, Some of these estimates and assumptions aresubject to market forces and will change over time.
The valuation models applied to determine the value ofinvestment properties are sensitive to the assumptions made.
ANNUAL REPORT 2017 67
INDEPENDENTAUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF YEO HIAF’ SENG LIMITED
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We evaluated the qualifications and competence ofthe external valuers. We considered the valuationmethodologies used against those applied byother valuers for similar property types. We testedthe integrity of inputs of the forecasted rental rateand price per square metre used in the valuations.
We challenged the capitalisation rate and price persquare metre used in the valuations by comparingthem against available industry data, taking intoconsideration the comparability and market factors.
We also considered the adequacy of the disclosures inthe financial statements, in describing the inherent degreeof subjectivity and key assumptions in the estimates.
Our findings:
The valuers are members of professional bodies forvaluerst The valuation methodologies used are in linewith generally accepted market practices and the keyassumptions used are within the range of market data. Thedisclosures in the financial statements are appropriate.

Valuation of InventoriesRefer to note 2.18 and note 13 to the financial statements
The key audit matter
Inventories represent 7.2% of the Group's total assetsas at 31 December 2017. Cost of inventories may not berecoverable if those inventories are damaged, expired orobsolete; or if their selling prices have declined significantlysuch that net realisable value is below their carrying amount.
The write-down of inventories to net realisablevalue is based on the age of these inventories,prevailing market conditions in the consumer foodand beverage industry and historical provisioningexperience which require management judgement.
Other information
How the matter was addressed in our audit
We assessed management’s basis of write-down andperformed the following audit procedures, amongstothers:
- Tested the amount of obsolete or expired finishedgoods recorded to actual write-off incurred in thepast;
- Assessed whether the inventory write—down made
at reporting date was consistent with the Group’sprovisioning policy;
0 Tested the inventory ageing reports which age theproducts by expiration date;
- Tested the process which determines the date ofexpiration for the finished goods produced;
- Checked the adequacy of the write»d0wn madeaccording to the finished goods‘ expiry dates; and
- Tested the net realisable value of finished goodsby comparing the costs to selling prices after theyear-end or to the latest selling price available.
Our findings:
We found the carrying amount and write-down ofinventories to be reasonable.
Management is responsible for the other information contained in the annual report. Other information is defined asall information in the annual report other than the financial statements and our auditors’ report thereon. We haveobtained all other information prior to the date of this auditors' report except for the Statistics of Shareholdings, which

CORPORATE IMPROVEMENT INITIATIVES
In light of the challenging operating and businessenvironment in the markets that we operate in, we steppedup our efforts on improvement initiatives across the Groupto enhance operational efficiencies and extract savings.
In procurement, we continued on efforts to identifyand qualify alternative suppliers to ensure reliableand competitive sourcing of raw materials. On themanufacturing front, we are building on last year’sefforts to raise the productivity of our workers throughstreamlining of workflow and efficient productionscheduling.
From April 2017, we leveraged on our resources andexpertise to provide warehousing and logistics services toCoca Cola Singapore Beverages. In addition to bringingon a new revenue stream to the Group, it enables us tooptimise the utilisation of our assets‘ We look forward toworking closer with Coca Cola Singapore Beverages tofurther expand our relationship.
On the corporate front, we are strengthening the resilienceand efficiency of the Group through the rationalisation ofour organisation structure and enhancement of our RiskManagement framework to better manage risk. We arealso unlocking value from our real estate assets throughleasing or sale.
Overall, we adopted a coordinated, group-wide andcross-functional approach to improve cost and operationalefficiency. Through these initiatives, we are transformingthe Group into a leaner and more agile business, which willput us in good stead to capture opportunities when theyarise. We will continue to pursue continuous corporateimprovements into 2018.
NOTE 0F APPRECIATION

INDEPENDENTAUDITORS’ REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF YEO HIAF’ SENG LIMITED
If, based on the work we have performed that we obtained prior to the date of this auditors’ report, we concludethat there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing toreport in this regard.
When we read the Statistics of Shareholdings, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we arerequired to communicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordancewith SSAs.
Responsibilities of management and directors for the ﬁnancial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance withthe provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficientto provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; andtransactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fairfinancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a goingconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accountingunless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but todo so,
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free frommaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance withSSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and areconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient andappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting fromfraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,misrepresentations, or the override of internal controls.
0 Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theGroup’s internal controls.
0 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates andrelated disclosures made by management.

- Conclude 0n the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that maycast significant doubt on the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a materialuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in thefinancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are basedon the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events or conditions maycause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achievesfair presentation.
0 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activitieswithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for thedirection, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit andsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bearon our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance inthe audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe thesematters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, inextremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because theadverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of suchcommunication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory RequirementsIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiarycorporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordance with the
provisions of the Act

Acquisitions
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for business combinations entered intoby the Group.
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary or business comprises the fair valueof the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued by the Group. Theconsideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingent consideration arrangementat the acquisition date.
Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a businesscombination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at the acquisitiondate
On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest inthe acquiree at the date of acquisition either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest'sproportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets.
The excess of (a) the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controliinginterest in the acquiree and the acquisition—date fair value of any previoust-held equity interest inthe acquiree over (b) the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.Please refer to Note 2.6 for the accounting policy on goodwill.
Disposals
When a change in the Group’s ownership interest in a subsidiary results in a loss of control overthe subsidiary, the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary including any goodwill are derecognised.Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in respect of that entity are alsoreclassified to proﬁt or loss or transferred directly to retained profits if required by a specificStandard.
Any retained equity interest in the entity is remeasured at fair value. The difference betweenthe carrying amount of the retained interest at the date when control is lost and its fair value isrecognised in profit or loss.
Please refer to Note 2.7 for the accounting policy on investments in subsidiaries in the separatefinancial statements of the Company.

The cost of an item of property, plant and equipment initially recognised includes its purchaseprice and any cost that is directly attributable to bringing the asset to the location and conditionnecessary for it to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management. Cost alsoincludes borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or productionof a qualifying asset Please refer to Note 2.8 for the accounting policy on borrowing costs‘
DepreciationNo depreciation is provided on construction-in-progress and freehold land.
Depreciation on other items of property, plant and equipment is calculated using the straight—Iine methodto allocate their depreciable amounts over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Useful livesLeasehold land (over term of lease) 50 — 99 yearsBuildings on freehold and leasehold land 20 — 50 yearsPlant and machinery, furniture and fittings 5 — 20 yearsComputer equipment and software costs 3 — 7 yearsMotor vehicles and trucks 5 — 10 years
The residual values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of property, plant and equipmentare reviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The effects of any revision arerecognised in profit or loss when the changes arise.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment that has already been recognisedis added to the carrying amount of the asset only when it is probable that future economic benefitsassociated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. Allother repair and maintenance expenses are recognised in profit or loss when incurred‘
Disposal
On disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the disposal proceedsand its carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss within “other gains and losses.
Transfer of property, plant and equipment to investment properties
When the use of a property changes from owner»occupation to investment property holding, the propertyis remeasured to fair value before transfer. Any gain arising on remeasurement is recognised in profit orloss to the extent that it reverses a previous impairment loss on the specific property, with any remaininggain recognised in the property revaluation reserve in equity. Any loss is recognised immediately in profitor loss.

Investment properties are initially recognised at cost and subsequently carried at fair value, determined annuallyby independent professional valuers on the highest-and-best-use basis. Changes in fair values are recognisedin profit or loss.
The cost of major renovations and improvements is capitalised and the carrying amounts of the replacedcomponents are recognised in profit or loss. The cost of maintenance, repairs and minor improvements isrecognised in profit or loss when incurred.
On disposal of an investment property, the difference between the disposal proceeds and the carwing amountis recognised in profit or loss.
When the use of an investment property changes such that it becomes 0wner»occupied and is transferredto property, plant and equipment, its fair value at the date of change in use becomes its deemed cost forsubsequent accounting.
Goodwill
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses represents the excess of (a) the aggregate of theconsideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-datefair value of any previoust-held equity interest in the acquiree over (b) the fair value of the identifiable netassets acquired. Goodwill on subsidiaries is recognised separately as intangible assets and carried at cost lessaccumulated impairment losses‘
Goodwill on acquisition of associated companies and joint ventures represents the excess of the cost ofacquisition over the Group‘s share of the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired.

Significant accounting policies (continued)Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method except for those costs thatare directly attributable to the construction or development of properties and assets under construction. Thisincludes those costs on borrowings acquired specifically for the construction or development of properties andassets under construction, as well as those in relation to general borrowings used to finance the constructionor development of properties and assets under construction.
The actual borrowing costs incurred during the period up to the issuance of the temporary occupation permitless any investment income on temporary investment of these borrowings, are capitalised in the cost of theproperties under development and assets under construction. Borrowings costs on general borrowings arecapitalised by applying a capitalisation rate to construction or development expenditures that are ﬁnanced bygeneral borrowings.
Impairment of non-financial assets(a) Goodwill
Goodwill recognised separately as an intangible asset is tested for impairment annually and wheneverthere is indication that the goodwill may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group'scash-generating-units (“CGU”) expected to benefit from synergies arising from the business combination.
An impairment loss is recognised when the carrying amount of a CGU, including the goodwill, exceedsthe recoverable amount of the CGU. The recoverable amount of a CGU is the higher of the CGU’s fairvalue less cost to sell and value-in—use.
The total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocatedto the CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount ofeach asset in the CGU.
An impairment loss on goodwill is recognised in profit or loss and is not reversed in a subsequent period.
(b) Property, plant and equipmentInvestments in subsidiaries. associated companies and joint ventures
Property, plant and equipment and investments in subsidiaries, associated companies and joint venturesare tested for impairment whenever there is any objective evidence or indication that these assets maybe impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fair value less costto sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unless the asset does not generatecash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets. If this is the case, the recoverableamount is determined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.

The difference between the carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an impairment lossin profit or loss. An impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is reversed only if there has beena change in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amount since the last impairmentloss was recognised. The carrying amount of this asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount,provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined(net of accumulated depreciation) had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversal of impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognised in profit or loss.

Classiﬁcation
The Group classifies its ﬁnancial assets in the following categories: loans and receivables, ﬁnancial assetsat fair value through profit or loss and availabIe-for-sale financial assets. The classification depends onthe purpose for which the assets were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financialassets at initial recognition.
(0 Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable paymentsthat are not quoted in an active market. They are presented as current assets, except for thoseexpected to be realised later than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are presented asnon—current assets. Loans and receivables are presented as “cash and cash equivalents”, “tradeand other receivables excluding prepayments and loans to subsidiaries 0n the balance sheet.
(ii) Financial assets designated at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss at inception are those that aremanaged and their performance are evaluated on a fair value basis in accordance with the Group’sinvestment strategy. They are presented as non-current assets unless management expects torealise the assets within 12 months after the balance sheet date,
(iii) Availab/e-for-sa/e ﬁnancial assetsAvailabIe-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated in this categow
or not classified in any of the other categories. They are presented as non-current assets unlessmanagement expects to realise the assets within 12 months after the balance sheet date.

Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date — the date on whichthe Group commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are dereoognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the financial assets haveexpired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards ofownership. On disposal of a financial asset, the difference between the sale proceeds and the carryingamount is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount previously recognised in other comprehensive incomerelating to that asset is also reclassified to profit or loss.
Initial measurement
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets atfair value through profit or loss, which are recognised at fair value. Transaction costs for financial assetsat fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately as expenses.
Subsequent measurement
AvailabIe-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are subsequentlycarried at fair value. Loans and receivables are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effectiveinterest method.
Interest and dividend income on availabIe-for-sale financial assets and financial assets at fair valuethrough profit or loss, and changes in fair values of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss arerecognised separately in profit or loss. Changes in the fair values of availabIe-for—sale equity securities(i.e. non-monetary items) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the fairvalue reserve, together with the related currency translation differences.
Impairment
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financialasset or a group of financial assets is impaired and recognises an allowance for impairment when suchevidence exists
{0 Loans and receivables
Significant ﬁnancial difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy,and default or significant delay in payments are objective evidence that these financial assets areimpaired.
The carwing amount of these assets is reduced through the use of an impairment allowanceaccount which is calculated as the difference between the carrying amount and the present valueof estimated future cash flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. When the assetbecomes uncolleotible, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries ofamounts previously written off are recognised against the same line item in profit or loss‘

(1) Loans and receivables (continued)
The impairment allowance account is reduced through profit or loss in a subsequent period whenthe amount of impairment loss decreases and the related decrease can be objectively measured.The carrying amount of the asset previously impaired is increased to the extent that the newcarrying amount does not exceed the amortised cost had no impairment been recognised in priorperiods.
(/7) Ava/IaDIe-for-sa/e ﬁnancial assets
In addition to the objective evidence of impairment described in Note 2.10(e)(i), a significant orprolonged decline in the fair value of an equity security below its cost is objective evidence thatthe availabIe-for-sale financial asset is impaired.
If any objective evidence of impairment exists, the cumulative loss that was recognised in othercomprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss, The cumulative loss is measured as thedifference between the acquisition cost and the current fair value, less any impairment losspreviously recognised in profit or loss. The impairment losses recognised as an expense on equitysecurities are not reversed through profit or loss in subsequent period.
Non-current assets classified as held-for-sale
Non-current assets are Classified as assets heId-for-sale and carried at the lower of carrying amount and fairvalue less costs to sell if their carrying amount is recovered principally through a sale transaction rather thanthrough continuing use. The assets are not depreciated or amortised while they are classified as held-for—sale.Any impairment loss on initial classification and subsequent measurement is recognised as an expense. Anysubsequent increase in fair value less costs to sell (not exceeding the accumulated impairment loss that hasbeen previously recognised) is recognised in profit or loss.
Offsetting financial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount reported in the balance sheet when there is a legallyenforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or realise the asset and settle theliability simultaneously.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end offinancial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less
(or in the normal operating cycle of the business if longer). Otherwise, they are presented as non»current liabilities.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently carried at amortised cost usingthe effective interest method.

Significant accounting policies (continued)Borrowings
Borrowings are presented as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlementfor at least 12 months after the balance sheet date, in which case they are presented as non-current liabilities.
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequently carried at amortisedcost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognisedin profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
A derivative financial instrument is initially recognised at its fair value on the date the contract is entered intoand is subsequently carried at its fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends onwhether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged.
Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognisedin profit or loss when the changes arise
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between the hedging instrumentsand hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategies for undertaking various hedgingtransactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis,of whether the derivatives designated as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsetting changes in cashflows of the hedged items‘
The carrying amount of a derivative designated as a hedge is presented as a non-current asset or liability ifthe remaining expected life of the hedged item is more than 12 months, and as a current asset or liability ifthe remaining expected life of the hedged item is less than 12 months, The fair value of a trading derivative ispresented as a current asset or liability.
Cash ﬂow hedge
The Group has entered into currency forwards or designated non—derivative financial assets or liabilities thatqualify as cash flow hedges against highly probable forecasted transactions in foreign currencies. The fairvalue changes on the effective portion of the currency forwards or n0n»derivative financial assets or liabilitiesdesignated as cash flow hedges are recognised in other comprehensive income, accumulated in the hedgingreserve and transferred to profit or loss when the hedged forecast transactions are recognised
The fair value changes on the ineffective portion of currency forwards or non-derivative financial assets orliabilities are recognised immediately in profit or loss. When a forecasted transaction is no longer expected tooccur, the gains and losses that were previously recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified toprofit or loss immediately‘

Significant accounting policies (continued)Fair value estimation of financial assets and liabilities
he fair values of financial instruments traded in active markets (such as exchange-traded and over-the-countersecurities and derivatives) are based on quoted market prices at the balance sheet date. The quoted marketprices used for ﬁnancial assets are the current bid prices and the appropriate quoted market prices used forinancial liabilities are the current asking prices.
he fair values of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market are determined by using valuationechniques. The Group uses a variety of methods and makes assumptions based on market conditions thatare existing at each balance sheet date. Where appropriate, quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similarnstruments are used. Valuation techniques, such as discounted cash flow analysis, are also used to determinehe fair values of the financial instruments.
he fair values of financial liabilities carried at amortised cost are estimated by discounting the future contractualcash flows at the current market interest rates that are available to the Group for similar financial instruments.
he fair values of currency forwards are determined using actively quoted forward exchange rates.

he fair values of current financial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost approximate their carwingamounts.
Leases
(a) Finance leases when the Group is the lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewardsincidental to ownership of the leased assets are classified as finance leases.
The leased assets and the corresponding lease liabilities (net of finance charges) under finance leases arerecognised on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and borrowings respectively, at theinception of the leases based on the lower of the fair value of the leased assets and the present valueof the minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction of the outstandinglease liability The finance expense is recognised in profit or loss on a basis that reflects a constantperiodic rate of interest on the finance lease liability.
(b) Operating leases(I) When the Group is the lesseeLeases of property, plant and equipment where substantially all risks and rewards incidental toownership are retained by the lessors are classified as operating leases. Payments made under
operating leases (net of any incentives received from the lessors) are recognised in profit or losson a straight—Iine basis over the period of the lease.

Leases of investment properties and other assets where the Group retains substantially all risks andrewards incidental to ownership are classified as operating leases, Rental income from operatingleases (net of any incentives given to the lessees) is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-Iinebasis over the lease term.
2.18 Inventories
Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a weighted averagebasis. The cost of finished goods and work-in-progress comprises raw materials, direct labour, other direct costsand related production overheads (based on normal operating capacity) but excludes borrowing costs. Costalso includes any gains or losses on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currency purchases of inventoriesNet realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less the estimated costsof completion and applicable variable selling expenses.
2.19 Income taxes
Current income tax for current and prior periods is recognised at the amount expected to be paid to or recoveredfrom the tax authorities, using the tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted bythe balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets andliabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements except when the deferred income tax arisesfrom the initial recognition of goodwill or an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combinationand affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss at the time of the transaction.
A deferred income tax liability is recognised on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries,associated companies and joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal ofthe temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
A deferred income tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will beavailable against which the deductible temporary differences and tax losses can be utilised
Deferred income tax is measured:(i) at the tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or
the deferred income tax liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted 0rsubstantively enacted by the balance sheet date; and

(ii) based on the tax consequence that will follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the balancesheet date, to recover or settle the carrying amounts of its assets and liabilities except for investmentproperties. Investment property measured at fair value is presumed to be recovered entirely through sale.
Current and deferred income taxes are recognised as income or expense in profit or loss, except to the extentthat the tax arises from a business combination or a transaction which is recognised directly in equity‘ Deferredincome tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of pastevents; it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and theamount has been reliably estimated.
Employee compensationEmployee benefits are recognised as an expense, unless the cost qualifies to be capitalised as an asset(3) Deﬁned contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are post-employment benefit plans under which the Group pays fixedcontributions into separate entities such as the Central Provident Fund on a mandatow, contractual orvoluntaw basis‘ The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid.
(b) Deﬁned beneﬁt plan
Post-employment benefits relate to retirement benefits given to employees and are a non-contributoryunfunded retirement beneﬁts scheme for employees who are eligible under labour laws or collectivebargaining agreements.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans is the presentvalue of the defined benefit obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of plan assets.The defined benefit obligation is calculated by independent estuaries using the projected unit creditmethod The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimatedfuture cash outflows using market yields at the end of the reporting period.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions arecharged or credited to equity in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in profit or loss.

Share-based compensation
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan for the Group’s employees witha share option plan component and a performance share plan component. The value of the employeeservices received in exchange for the grant of options on shares or shares is recognised as an expensewith a corresponding increase in the share-based payment reserve over the vesting period‘ The totalamount to be recognised over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of the optionson shares or share awards on the date of the grant. Non-market vesting conditions are included in theestimation of the number of shares under the plan which are expected to become exercisable on thevesting date. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of shares underthe plan which are expected to become exercisable on the vesting date and recognises the impact of therevision of the estimates in profit or loss, with a corresponding adjustment to the share-based paymentresen/e over the remaining vesting period
When the options are exercised or when the shares are issued, the proceeds received (net of transactioncosts) and the related balance previously recognised in the share-based payment reserve are creditedto share capital account when new ordinary shares are issued to the employees.
Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable whenever an employee’s employment is terminated before the normalretirement date or whenever an employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these benefits.The Group recognises termination benefits when it is demonstrably committed to either terminating theemployment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal orproviding termination benefits as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy. Benefitsfalling due more than 12 months after balance sheet date are discounted to present value.
Bonus plans
The Group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses, based on a formula that takes intoconsideration the profit attributable to the Company's shareholders after certain adjustments. The Grouprecognises a provision when there is a contractual obligation to pay or when there is a past practice thathas created a constructive obligation to pay
Annual leave entitlementEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognised when they accrue to employees‘ A provision is
made for the estimated liability for annual leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to thebalance sheet date.

Transactions and balances
Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency (“foreign currency) are translated intothe functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Currency exchangedifferences resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation of monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the closing rates at the balance sheet dateare recognised in profit or loss. However, in the consolidated financial statements, currency translationdifferences arising from net investment in foreign operations are recognised in other comprehensiveincome and accumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve.
When a foreign operation is disposed of, the accumulated currency translation differences is reclassifiedto profit or loss, as part of the gain or loss on disposal.
Foreign exchange gains and losses that relate to borrowings are presented in profit or loss within “ﬁnanceexpenses. All other foreign exchange gains and losses impacting profit or loss are presented in profitor loss within “other gains and losses”.
Non-monetaw items measured at fair values in foreign currencies are translated using the exchange ratesat the date when the fair values are determined.
Translation of Group entities’ ﬁnancial statements
The results and balance sheet of all the Group entities (none of which has the currency of ahyperinflationary economy) that have a functional currency different from the presentation currency aretranslated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities are translated at the closing exchange rates at the reporting date;
(ii) income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless the average is not areasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates,in which case income and expenses are translated using the exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions); and
(iii) all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in other comprehensive income andaccumulated in the foreign currency translation reserve. These currency translation differencesare reclassified to profit or loss on disposal of the entity giving rise to such reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations are treated as assetsand liabilities of the foreign operations and translated at the closing rates at the reporting date.

3. Critical accounting estimates, assumptions and judgements
Estimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience andother factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
Fair value of investment properties
Investment properties are stated at fair value based on valuations performed by independent professional valuers.The fair values are based on highest—and-best-use basis and certain judgements are required over the valuationtechniques and inputs used. The valuation techniques, key inputs, other assumptions and the carrying amountsat the reporting dates are disclosed in Note 20.
Valuation of inventories
The Group carries out periodic reviews on inventory obsolescence and any decline in the net realisable valuebelow cost will be recorded against inventory balance. Management considers future demand, expected sellingprices and ageing analysis of the inventories as part of its inventory obsolescence assessment process to arriveat their best estimate of the net realisable value of inventories. Such evaluation process requires significantjudgment and may affect the carrying amount of inventories at the balance sheet date.
