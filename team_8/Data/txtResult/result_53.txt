Overview of Business Activities of the CompanyEconomic and Financial Environment
Looking back on the economic environment during thefiscal year under review, despite signs of improvement inthe employment situation during the first half of the year,the economy continued to experience a temporary |u|| dueto a slack trend in personal consumption and downturns incorporate earnings and business confidence. Consequently,the Japanese government decided to delay raising the con-sumption tax rate to 10% and announced an economic stimeulus package totaling 28 trillion yen Furthermore, the Bankof Japan introduced a new monetary easing measure,“Quantitative and Qualitative Monetary Easing with YieldCurve Control in September, Overseas, oil prices rose dueto an agreement being reached on the cutting of oil pro-duction at the OPEC Meeting in November. Meanwhile, theU.S. economy continued its solid recovery as the FederaiReserve raised the benchmark interest rate in both Decemeber and March.
In this environment, the yen strengthened and stockprices fell in the domestic financial market while the yieldon the 10-year Japanese government bond remained neg-ative, reflecting the UlK/s referendum decision in June toleave the EU. However, following Donaid Trump's victory inthe US. presidential election in November, the yen weak,ened and stock prices rose in expectation of the effect ofTrump's economic policies, pushing the yield on the 107yearJapanese government bond into positive territory.

(14) Hedge Accounting(a) |nterest-re1ated risk hedge

Such transactions are generaHy treated as deferredhedges as specified in “Treatment for Accounting and Audit-ing of Application of Accounting Standard for Financial Inastruments in Banking Industny” (Japanese Institute ofCertified Public Accountants (”JICF’A) Industry AuditingCommittee Report No. 24 of February 13, 2002, “Report No.24”). To evaluate the effectiveness of hedges designed to off,set market fluctuations, hedged items, such as deposits, loansand bills discounted, and hedging instruments, such as inter,est rate swaps, are grouped by duration to maturity. The ef-fectiveness of hedges designed to fix cash ﬂow is evaluatedby verifying the correlation between the interest volatility fac-tors for the hedged items and the hedging instruments.
In accordance with ”Temporary Treatment for Accountingand Auditing concerning Application of Accounting Stan,dard for Financiai instruments in Banking Industry” (JICPAIndustry Auditing Committee Report No. 15), SuMi TRUSTBank has adopted “Macro Hedge Accounting“ to accountfor certain interestarelated derivatives, which are utilized tomanage interest rate risk arising from transactions, such asloans and bills discounted, and deposits.

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Ho1dings, inc 2017 Financial Data Section

Additionally, transactions intended to hedge the foreignexchange risk associated with foreignedenominated securieties (other than bonds) are treated as portfolio hedges. Fairva1ue hedge accounting has been adopted to account forsuch transactions on the conditions that specific foreign-de-nominated securities are designated in advance as hedgeditems and that foreign currency payables of spot and for-ward foreign exchange contracts exist in excess of the acequisition cost of such foreign-denominated securities on aforeign currency basis,

Among derivatives transactions of SuMi TRUST Bankthattake piece between consolidated subsidiaries or that aremade internally between designated trading accounts andsome other accounts, those interest rate swaps and cross,currency swaps designated as hedging instruments are car-ried out in accordance with standards for cover deals withexternal parties, which eliminate discretion and enable strictmanagement on hedges pursuant to Report No, 24 and Report No. 25. Accordingiy, income or expenses arising fromsuch interest rate swaps and crossecurrency swaps are recognized as profits or losses, or deferred, rather than eliminated.
Deferred hedge accounting has been adopted for certainassets and liabilities by individual transactions
Other consolidated subsidiaries account for such trans,actions as deferred hedges or exceptional treatment for in,terest rate swaps by individual transactions.
(15) Amortization of GoodwiliGoodwiil is amortized over a period within 20 years thatis reasonably determined for each case. Goodwiil deemed
immaterial, however, is expensed as incurred.

This department identifies and ana-lyzes groupewide risk, tracks adherence to risk limits, and re,ports to respective directors in charge on a daily basis andto the board of directors periodically.
In SuMi TRUST Bank, the board of directors resolves ALMbasic plans and risk management plans as important mateters related to market risk under management pians. TheALM Committee resolves basic matters of ALM basic plansand risk management plans related to market risk regardingcompanyawide comprehensive risk management forassets/liabilities.
In SuMi TRUST Bank, the Risk Management Departmentis responsible for planning and implementing market riskmanagement. The role of the Risk Management Depart,ment includes measuring risk levels and profits/iosses andmonitoring the status of market risk managed under ALMbasic plans and the status of compliance with risk limits. TheDepartment reports its findings to the members of the ALMCommittee on a daily basis, and to the ALM Committee as
well as the board of directors periodicaliy.

(c) Market risk management approach
SuMi TRUST Group uses Value at Risk (“VaR”) to measuremarket risk exposures. VaR uses historicai market fluctuationto statistically predict the maximum expected losses underspecific conditions. Based on an internal modei developedby SuMi TRUST Group, SuMi TRUST Group manages marketrisks by measuring VaR and calculating various risk manage,ment indicators, and carrying out various simulations
The internally developed VaR model is basically the varieance-Covariance method, and the historical simulationmethod is also used for calculating some risks (nonlinearrisks and others), such as risks associated with option trans,actions. Market risk can be classified into categories, suchas interest rate risk, stock price risk, exchange rate risk, andothers according to its characteristics. SuMi TRUST Groupcalculates market risk by simply adding up the risks of allcategories without considering the correlation among thesecategories,
(d) Quantitative information related to market risk(i) Trading accounts
SuMi TRUST Group uses VaR for managing risks associ-ated with trading securities and some currency and interest,reiated derivatives transactions held in the ”TradingAccounts. The VaR model used is primarily based on thevariance-covariance method (with a hoiding period of 10business days, confidence interval of 99%, and observationperiod 01‘260 business days).
As of March 31 , 2017, the total amount of market risk (es,timated potential loss) of financiai instruments held by SuMiTRUST Group in the Trading Accounts was ¥5.5 billion (US$49 million)
SuMi TRUST Group performs back testing that comparesthe resuits ofVaR calcuiations based on its internal model withactual profit and loss, The back testing for the fiscal yearended March 31, 2017, resulted in one instance where actuallosses were in excess of VaR; therefore, SuMi TRUST Groupconsiders that the measurement model properly capturesmarket riskwith sufficient accuracy. However, as VaR measuresthe amount of market risk under certain probabiiities statistiecally calculated based on the past voiatility, it may not properly
capture those risks under extreme market movements.

(ii) Banking accounts
SuMi TRUST Group uses VaR for managing risks associeated with financiai assets and liabilities held in the ”BankingAccounts. The varianceecovariance method is the primarymeasurement method for interest/exchange rate and creditspread exposures, and the historical simulation method forstock price exposure (with a holding period of a maximumof one year according to a position, confidence interval of99%, and observation period of 260 business days—one orfive years for stock prices).
As of March 31, 2017, the total amount of market risk (es-timated potential ioss) ottinancial instruments heid by SuMiTRUST Group in the Banking Account was ¥802.4 biliion(US, $7,155 miilion).
SuMi TRUST Group performs back testing on certain po-sitions held in the ”Banking Accounts” that compares theresults of VaR calculations based on its internal model withactual profit and loss regarding financial assets and liabilitiessubject to measurement SuMi TRUST Group considers thatthe measurement model properly captures market risk withsufficient accuracy, However, as VaR measures the amountof market risk under certain probabilities statistically calcu-lated based on past volatility in the market, it may not prop,erly capture the risks under extreme market movements.
3) Funding liquidity risk management
Funding liquidity risk is the risk of financial loss to SuMiTRUST Group when the Group fails to raise necessary fundsor is forced to raise funds at significantly higher rates.
(3) Funding liquidity risk management poiicy
With regard to funding liquidity risks, SuMi TRUST Groupdesigns and implements a policy to build up a risk manage-ment framework for funding iiquidity risks, recognizing thatfinanciai difficuities due to exposure to such risks could posesibly iead SuMi TRUST Group directly to bankruptcy undercertain circumstances.(b) Funding liquidity risk management framework and methods
Funding Liquidity Risk Management Departments deter-mines the extent of SuMi TRUST Group’s cash crunch approepriately in cooperation with the liquidity managementdepartment, while gathering and analyzing information re,lated to both the internal environment, such as the Group'srisk profiles, and external environment, such as economic Cir,cumstances or market conditions based on the risk manage-ment plan approved by the board of directors semiannualiy,
To reduce funding liquidity risks, the funding liquidity riskmanagement departments manage cash flow within thepredetermined appropriate limits, and the funding liquidityrisk management departments monitor its compliance,
(4) Supplementary Explanation Concerning FairValue of Fiﬁnancial InstrumentsFair value of financial instruments is based on quotedprices in markets. if a quoted price is not avaiiable, a rea-sonabiy caicuiated amount is used as fair value. Calculationof such amounts involves certain assumptions and may valywhen different assumptions are employed,

These instruments with transactions without stated matuerities are stated at their carrying amounts because the car-rying amounts approximate fair value, For transactions withstated maturities, corresponding instruments are stated attheir carrying amounts because most of such transactionshave short contractual terms (one year or less) and the car-
rying amounts approximate fair vaiue,
(5) Monetary Claims Bought
Fair values of monetary claims bought for which counter-parties’ quoted prices or dealer/brokerequoted prices areavailable are stated at such prices. Fair values for all otherciaims are calculated by classifying them according to theirinternal ratings and maturities and discounting future cashflows to their present values.
(6) Trading Assets
Bonds and other securities held fortrading purposes arestated at dealer association prices or counterparties’ quotedprices. For shorteterm corporate bonds, their fair values arecaicuiated by discounting future cash ﬂows to their presentvalues.
(7) Money Held in Trust
Securities managed as trust assets in money held in trust,which are individually managed with the principal objectiveof securities portfolio management, are stated at quotedmarket prices or dealer/brokerequoted prices. Notes re,garding money held in trust by holding purposes are pre-sented under the ”Money Held in Trust” section.
(8) Securities
Stocks are stated at quoted market prices. Bonds are statedat quoted market prices, deaier association prices, counter,parties' quoted prices, or dealer/broker—quoted prices. Invest-ment trusts are stated at published reference prices.

Fair vaiues of privately placed bonds guaranteed by SuMiTRUST Bank are calculated by classifying them according totheir internal ratings and maturities, and discounting futurecash flows to their present value
Notes regarding securities by their holding purpose are
presented under the Securities section.
(9) Loans and Biiis Discounted
Fairvaiues of loans and bilis discounted are calculated bygrouping loans according to loan terms, internai ratings,and maturities; and discounting the aggregate principal andinterest by the assumed interest rate for similar new loans,However, variabIe-rate ioans for which their carryingamounts are deemed to approximate fair vaiue, due to thenature of the loan or the borrower’s credit situation subse-quent to the execution of the loans, are stated at their carerying amounts.
For claims executed to borrowers who went into iegalbankruptcy, virtual bankruptcy, and possible bankruptcy, es-timated loan losses are caiculated based on the presentvaiue of estimated future cash flows or the expected recov-erable amounts from coilateral or guarantees, Therefore, fairvalues for these claims are stated at the amounts by deduct-ing the allowance for loan losses from the amounts in theconsoiidated balance sheet at the consolidated balancesheet date, because such deducted amounts approximatefair vaiue.
Loans without stated maturities (as the amount of creditis iimited to the value ofthe collateral or due to some otherspecial characteristics) are stated at their carrying amountsas the carrying amounts are deemed to approximate fairvaiue because of the expected repayment periods and theinterest terms.
(1 i) Lease Receivables and Investment Assets
Fair values of lease receivabies and investment assets arecalculated by grouping these assets according to their in,terhai ratings and maturities, and discounting the aggregateprincipal and interest by the assumed interest rate for similarnew agreements.

6, Securities Reclassified due to the Change of the Hold—
ing Purpose
SuMi TRUST Holdings changed the holding purposes of for-eign bonds, which were classified under heldetoematurity seacurities, of ¥8,821 million (US. $79 million) to available-for-salesecurities during the fiscal year ended March 31, 2017, in ac,cordance with the US‘ financial regulatory reform biil.
There is no effect of this change on the consolidated ﬁnanacial statements since all of these securities were sold duringthe fiscal year ended March 31,2017.
7. Impairment of Securities
Securities other than securities whose fair vaiues are ex-tremely difficult to be determined, or those deemed to betrading securities, are treated as impaired when their fair val-ues have declined significantly from the acquisition cost andit is deemed unlikely to recover to the acquisition cost, Suchsecurities are recorded at their fair values in the consolidated
balance sheet. The difference between the acquisition cost
Money Held in Trust1, Money Held in Trust for Trading Purposes
and the fair values is recognized as an impairment loss.
Impairment losses recognized during the fisca1 year endedMarch 31, 2017, were ¥679 miilion (US. $6 million) on StocksImpairment losses recognized during the fiscal year endedMarch 31, 2016 were ¥6,130 million, of which ¥6,119 millionwas on stocks and ¥11 mi|1ion was on Other Securities,
The criteria for determining whetherthe fair vaiues of secu-rities have significantly dec1ined are as fol1ows:
For securities whose issuers are classified as ”normai underthe asset selfeassessment, a decline of 50% or more in the fairvalues compared with the acquisition cost; for securities whoseissuers are classified as ”closeeobservation borrowers,” 3 defcline of 30% or more in the fair values compared with the ac-quisition cost. In addition, the fair values of some securitiesare deemed unrecoverable and impairment losses are recog-nized when their fair values have declined more than 30% butless than 50% from acquisition cost and the fair vaiues have
continued to decline over a certain period,

(Notes)
1) In lieu of fair value per share, the fair price refers to an estiemate of each option's 1ntrinsic value (the dh‘ference betweenthe fair va1ue of the share calculated by the comparab1e trans,action price method and the exercise price).
2) The total amount of intrinsic value of the options was ¥O(U.St $0) as of March 31, 2017‘
3‘ Method for Estimating a Fair Unit Price for Stock Options
3) lfthe IPO price is set as any amount exceeding ¥737 (US$7), the Exercise Price she” be adjusted to an amount equalto the IPO Price on the IPO Date (the Exercise Price shaH beadjusted to reﬂect appropriately the nature of any split orconsolidation of shares after the AHotment Date, if any),
The method used to estimate a fair unit price for the SuMi TRUST Holdings Series 6 Subscription Rights to Shares is def
scribed be1ow.

(Notes)
1) Stock price volatility was calculated based on the closingprices for common stock of SuMi TRUST Holdings on thefinal trading day of each week during a past consecutive pe-r10d corresponding to the expected t1me to exercise.
2) The expected life of the stock option Ts estimated basedon expected tenures of holders of the subscription ﬁghts to
shares because it is difficult to reasonably estimate the ex-pected lite.
3) Dividend yield Ts based on the actual dividends on comvmon stock paid for the year ended March 31, 2016.
4) The rate represents the Japanese Government Bond yieldcorresponding to the expected life.
4. Method for Estimating the Number of Vested Stock OptionsSuMi TRUST Holdings has adopted a method to reflect only the number of stock options that have been actually forfeited,
because it is difﬁcuh to reasonab1y estimate the number that wi|1 be forfeited in the future.

Enhancement of Corporate Governance
2. Main Points of Enhancement of Corporate Governance of SuMi TRUST Holdings
The main points of the enhancement of corporate gover-nance of SuMi TRUST Holdings are separation of executionand supervision through the transition to a ”company withThree Committees,” strengthening of the system in line withthe SuMi TRUST Group's business model, and having anexternal director serve as chairman of the Board of Directors.
At a company with Three Committees, external directors comprise the majority of each of the three statutorycommittees estabiished as internal bodies of the Board ofDirectors, namely the Nominating Committee, CompensationCommittee and Audit Committee. A significant characteristicof such companies is that this allows for the creation of a moreetfective supervisoly structure, and makes switt decisions pos-sibie as the Board of Directors' decisionemaking authority onbusiness execution can be delegated to the executive offi-cers. in this way, SuMi TRUST Holdings seeks to establish bothmanagement capabilities to realize prompt business execuetion, and supervisory and restraining capabilities to ensuresound management.
Furthermore, in addition to the statutory committeesrequired by the Companies Act, SuMi TRUST Holdings hasestabiished the Risk Committee and Conﬂicts of InterestCommittee, as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors inwhich external directors participate] in order to ensure theetfectiveness of corporate governance while further enhancing
the soundness and reliability of the SuMi TRUST Group's busi-ness model along with transparency of management.
While a ”company with Three Committees“ is abiein principle to delegate important business executiondecisions to executive officers, the Board of Directorsis required to exercise a greater supervisory function.In light of the role expected of the Board of Directors,SuMi TRUST Holdings has appointed Mr. Isao Matsushita,an external director, as chairman ofthe meeting of theBoard of Directors. In addition, SuMi TRUST Hoidings hasestabiished the Corporate Secretariat as an organizationdedicated to assisting the chairman in fulfiiling his duties,and elected a fu||»time Audit Committee Member who isa non-executive director as deputy chairman of the Board,thereby providing various information mainly on agenda fordeliberation at the Board of Directors and offering assis-tance with regard to matters such as clarifying points fromthe perspective of management and supervision.
Through these initiatives, SuMi TRUST Holdings wiil lever-age its significant expertise and comprehensive capabili-ties distinctive of a trust banking group to provide detailed,clientroriented total solutions in response to increasinglycomplex and diverse client needs, while reinforcing the cor-porate governance system in iine with this business model.

(14) Hedge Accounting(a) Interest-retated risk hedge
SuMi TRUST Bank manages interest rate risk arising fromvarious assets and liabilities by using financial derivativestransactions. Such transactions are generally treated as deferred hedges as speciﬁed in ”Treatment for Accountingand Auditing of App‘ication of Accounting Standard for Fiﬁnahcial Instruments in Banking Industry“ (Japanese Instituteof Certified Public Accountants (JICF'A) Industry AuditingCommittee Report No. 24 of February 13, 2002, “Report No.24”). To evaluate the effectiveness of hedges designed tooffset market ﬂuctuations, hedged items, such as deposits,loans and bills discounted, and hedging Instruments, suchas interest rate swaps, are grouped by duration to maturity.The effectiveness of hedges designed to fix cash flow iseva‘uated by verifying the correlation between the interestvotatility factors for the hedged items and those for thehedging instruments.
In accordance with ”Temporary Treatment for Accountingand Auditing concerning App‘ication of Accounting Stan-dard for Financial instruments in Banking Industry” (JICPAIndustry Auditing Committee Report No. 15), SuMi TRUSTBank has adopted Macro Hedge Accounting” to accountfor certain interest-related derivatives, which are utilized tomanage interest rate risk arising from transactions, such as
loans and bills discounted, and deposits.
Deferred gains (losses) on hedges tn the consolidated baleance sheets as of the end of the current ﬁscal year that haveresulted from existing ”Macro Hedge Accounting) are amoretized over the remaining period designated under “MacroHedge Accounting“ of each hedging transaction.

The effective-ness of hedging instruments, such as crossecurrenO/ swapsand foreign exchange swaps, as a means of mitigating theforeign exchange risk arising from monetary claims anddebts denominated in foreign currencies, is evaluated byverifying that the foreign currency positions of such hedginginstruments are in amounts equivalent to the correspondingmonetary claims and debts denominated In foreign currenecIes, which are the hedged items.
Additionally, transactions intended to hedge the foreignexchange risk associated with foreign-denominated securi-ties (other than bonds) are treated as portfolio hedges Fairvatue hedge accounting has been adopted to account forsuch transactions on the conditions that specific foreignedeenominated securities are designated in advance as hedgeditems and that foreign currency payables of spot and forward foreign exchange contracts exist in excess of the ac-quisition cost of such foreignedenominated securities on aforeign currency basis.
The foreign exchange risk associated with investment in theshares of stocks in foreign subsidiaries and affiliated compaenies is individualty hedged using fon/vard exchange contractsdenominated in the same currency, and foreign currencytranslation adjustments arising from the hedging instrumentsare included in ”Foreign Currency Translation Adjustments.

Interview with Externai Director

Question
What is your impression of the effortsto improve corporate governance at
SuMi TRUST Holdings?
Whiie financial institutions belong to a business category that plays a significantpublic roie in the nationai economy to begin with, SuMi TRUST Holdings has beendesignated as one of the Domestic Systemically Important Banks (D?SIBs) of Japan,and is therefore required to have a greater degree of management soundness andunderlying corporate governance than ordinary financial institutions do.
In light of these expectations, SuMi TRUST Holdings is steadily taking steps toimprove corporate governance. It increased the number of external directors andexternal auditors and proceeded in turn to voiuntariiy establish the Nominatingand Compensation Committee and Audit Committee. Then, after confirming thatthese measures ensured the transparency of management and were effectivein strengthening the supervisory function of the Board of Directors, it made thetransition from a “company with a Board of Corporate Auditors” to a “companywith Three Committees”
In addition, I can see that the SuMi TRUST Group has devised creative measuresbased on the Group’s unique characteristics for its structure Following the transi7tion, including the voluntary establishment of the Risk Committee and Conflicts ofInterest Committee as advisory bodies to the Board of Directors, in addition to thethree statutory committees (Nominating, Compensation and Audit Committees).
Going forward, I beiieve it will be important for SuMi TRUST Holdings to shiftits focus even more towards formulation of the SuMi TRUST Group’s managementpolicy and supervision of business execution, and to engage in high»qua|ity discus-sion at the Board of Directors aimed at improvement of corporate value, in order tofurther enhance corporate governance.

Question
As chairman of the Board ofDirectors, to what areas ofmanagement do you intend to
pay particular attention?
I consider the most important role of the Board of Directors to be promoting thecompany's sustainable growth and improving corporate value over the medium-to longiterm, by laying down a basic management policy and strategic directionbased on an accurate assessment of management issues and the environment inwhich the company operates, and supervising management overall. The manage-ment environment surrounding financiai institutions in particuiar is undergoingmajor developments on a global ievel, and in order for the Board of Directors tosteer its way decisively and carefully through these environmentai changes, it iscrucial that it enhances both the offensive and defensive aspects of corporate gov-ernance and fuifili its accountabiiity to stakeholders.
To tulfiil this role, the Board of Directors must make objective decisions in anappropriate manner from a standpoint independent of management. By makingthe transition to a company with Three Committees, and selecting me, an externaldirector, as chairman of the Board, SuMi TRUST Hoidings has truiy expressed itsdetermination to strongly promote enhancement of corporate governance fromthis perspective.
In response, as chairman of the Board of Directors, i wiii establish a decision-making process that encourages critical discussion and exhaustive deiiberation thatinciudes opposing views, rather than management that aims to preserve harmony.Furthermore, I intend to provide the Board appropriately with necessanj and adequate information while making tuil use of the knowiedge and expertise of externaidirectors in order to implement this kind of sound decision-making, First and fore-most, I think what is expected of me is to offer a compietely externai perspectiveas a person with no experience in the financial industry, and to present my opinionsfirmly without holding back.

Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, lnc 20l7 Financial Data Section
2) Market risk management
Market risk is the risk of financial loss of SuMi TRUST BankGroup through changes in income and value of assets andliabilities held, including off-balance items, due to fluctua-tions in various market risk factors, such as interest rates, ex,change rates, equity prices, commodity prices, and creditspreads.
(a) Risk management policy on market risk
In managing market risk, SuMi TRUST Bank Group enasures the soundness of its business by appropriately con-trolling risks, and strives to secure reasonable profits whichcorrespond to strategic goals, the scale and nature of its op-erations, and risk profiles through an advanced risk manage,ment framework.
(b) Risk management framework for market risk
In SuMi TRUST Bank, the board of directors resolves ALMbasic plans and risk management plans as important mateters related to market risk under management plans. TheALM Committee resolves basic matters of ALM basic plansand risk management plans related to market risk regardingcompanyewide comprehensive risk management forassets/liabilities.
In SuMi TRUST Bank, the Risk Management Departmentis responsible for planning and implementing market riskmanagement. The role of the Risk Management Depart,ment includes measuring risk levels and profits/losses andmonitoring the status of market risk managed under ALMbasic plans and the status of compliance with risk limits. TheDepartment reports its findings to the members ofthe ALMCommittee on a daily basis, and to the ALM Committee aswell as the board of directors periodically.
(c) Market risk management approach
SuMi TRUST Bank Group uses Value at Risk (VaR)to measeure market risk exposures. VaR uses historical market fluctua»tion to statistically predict the maximum expected losses underspecific conditions. Based on an internal model developed bySuMi TRUST Bank Group, SuMi TRUST Bank manages marketrisks by measuring VaR and calculating various risk manage,ment indicators, and carrying out various simulations
The internally developed VaR model is basically the varieance-covariance method, and the historical simulationmethod is also used for calculating some risks (nonlinear risksand others), such as risks associated with option transactions.
===================================================
242.hocr: 
Fmanctai Data: Notes (0 Consolidated Financial Statements

Market risk can be classified into categories, such as interestrate risk, stock price risk, exchange rate risk, and others ac,cording to its characteristics. SuMi TRUST Bank calculatesmarket risk by simply adding up the risks of all categorieswithout considering the correlation among these categories.(d) Quantitative information reiated to market risk
(i) Trading accounts
SuMi TRUST Bank Group uses VaR for managing risks as-sociated with trading securities and some currency and in,terest-related derivatives transactions held in the “TradingAccounts. The VaR model used is primariiy based on thevarianceecovariance method (with a holding period of 10business days, confidence interval of 99%, and observationperiod of 260 business days).
As of March 31, 2017, the total amount of market risk (es»timated potential ioss) offinancial instruments heid by SuMiTRUST Bank Group in the Trading Accounts was ¥5.5 billion(U.St $49 miiiion)
SuMi TRUST Bank Group performs back testing that comepares the resuits of VaR calculations based on its internaimodel with actual profit and loss. The back testing for thefiscal year ended March 31, 2017, resuited in one instancewhere actual losses were in excess of VaR; therefore, SuMiTRUST Bank Group considers that the measurement modeiproperly captures market risk with sufficient accuracy. How,ever, as VaR measures the amount of market risk under cer-tain probabilities statistically calculated based on the pastvolatility, it may not properly capture those risks under e><-treme market movements.
(ii) Banking accounts
SuMi TRUST Bank Group uses VaR for managing risks as,sociated with financial assets and liabilities held in the Bank-ing Accounts. The varianceecovariance method is theprimary measurement method for interest/exchange rateand credit spread exposures, and the historical simulationmethod for stock price exposure (with a holding period of amaximum of one year according to a position; confidenceinterval of 99%; and observation period of 260 businessdaysione or five years for stock prices),
As of March 31, 2017, the total amount of market risk (es-timated potential ioss) offinancial instruments heid by SuMiTRUST Bank Group in the Banking Account was ¥802.4 bil-lion (US. $7,155 million).
SuMi TRUST Bank Group performs back testing on certainpositions held in the ”Banking Accounts that compares theresults ofVaR calculations based on its internal model withactual profit and 1055 regarding financial assets and liabilitiessubject to measurement. SuMi TRUST Bank Group consideers that the measurement model properly captures marketrisk with sufficient accuracy. However, as VaR measures theamount of market risk under certain probabilities statisticallycalculated based on past volatility in the market, it may notproperly capture the risk under extreme market movements
3) Funding liquidity risk management
Funding liquidity risk is the risks of financial loss to SuMiTRUST Bank Group when the Group fails to raise necessaiyfunds or is forced to raise funds at significantly higher rates,(a) Funding liquidity risks management policy
With regard to funding liquidity risk, SuMi TRUST BankGroup designs and implements a policy to build up a riskmanagement framework for funding liquidity risk, recognizeing that financial difficulties due to exposure to such riskscouid possibly lead SuMi TRUST Bank Group directly tobankruptcy under certain circumstances.
(b) Funding liquidity risk managementframeworkand methods
Funding liquidity risk management departments deter-mine the extent of SuMi TRUST Bank Group's cash crunchappropriately in cooperation with the liquidity managementdepartments, whiie gathering and analyzing information re-lated to both the internal environment, such as SuMi TRUSTBank Group's risk profiles, and external environment, suchas economic circumstances or market conditions, based onthe risk management pian approved by the board of directors semiannually.
To reduce liquidity risk, the funding iiquidity managementdepartments manage cash flow within the predeterminedappropriate limits, and the funding liquidity risk manage-ment departments monitor its compliance.
(4) Supplementary Explanation Concerning FairValue of Fienancial InstrumentsFair vaiue of financial instruments is based on quotedprices in markets. if a quoted price is not avaiiable, a rea-sonabiy caicuiated amount is used as fair value.

For claims executed to borrowers who went into iegalbankruptcy, virtual bankruptcy, and possible bankruptcy, es,timated loan losses are caiculated based on the presentva‘ue of estimated future cash flows or the expected recoveerable amounts from coilateral or guarantees. Therefore, fairvalues forthese claims are stated at the amounts by deduct,ing the allowance for loan losses from the amounts in theconso‘idated balance sheets at the consolidated balancesheet date, because such deducted amounts approximatefair value,
Loans without stated maturities (as the amount of creditis \imited to the value of the collateral or due to some otherspecial characteristics) are stated at their carrying amountsas the carrying amounts are deemed to approximate the fairvaiues because ofthe expected repayment periods and theinterest terms.
(1 1) Lease Receivables and Investment Assets
Fair values of lease receivabies and investment assets arecalculated by grouping these assets according to their in-ternai ratings and maturities, and discounting the aggregateprincipal and interest by the assumed interest rate for similar
new agreements.

Amid the drastic changes in the environment surroundingﬁnancial institutions, including economic, financial and reguelately changes, we have entered a stage in which it is increas-ingly important to share environmental assumptions and riskawareness within the Group and to improve profitabilitythrough appropriate risk-taking in line with our managementstrategy under systematic risk management The SumitomoMitsui Trust Group (the “SuMi TRUST Group”) has introduceda risk appetite framework (RAF), with the aim ofboth strength-ening profitability and enhancing risk management.
The RAF is a group-wide business management frameworkmade up of the process for deciding the types and levels ofrisk that SuMi TRUST Holdings is willing to take, within its riskcapacity, in order to achieve its management strategies for-mulated by management based on the SuMi TRUST Group'ssocial role and management policies, together with the in-ternal control system underpinning that process.
The SuMi TRUST Group's RAF aims primarily to bothstrengthen profitability and enhance risk management, andpromotes the realization ofthose goals through environmentalassumptions and risk awareness, and increasing the trans-parency of risk-taking through the setting, communication, andoversight of risk appetite, appropriate allocation of manage-ment resources, and monitoring of operational status.

4) Stress Testing
it is becoming increasingly important to develop and reviewcountermeasures beforehand, against contingencies such as a fi-nancial crisis. These measures should be based on prior analysisand recognition ofthe impact on corporate management and fi-nance, in the event of materialization ot the stress event.
The SuMi TRUST Group conducts stress tests as a part of sce-nario analyses under the risk capital allocation plan (economic capeital) and the capital adequacy ratio plan (regulatory capital), andutilizes the result for purposes including assessment of capital ad,equacy levels and development of countermeasures against theoccurrence of the risks (contingency plan) when formulating maneagement plans
0 The framework of Stress Testing
Several scenarios are developed assuming the recurrence ofan event that actually took place in the past i0 to 20 year periodwith significant impact on SuMi TRUST Holdings’ portfolio (his,torical scenarios) and forward—Iooking scenarios (hypotheticalscenarios) with relatively high probabilities of occurrence de-pending on the market environment with significant impact onthe corporate management. The committees, etc, whosemembers include ofﬁcers, select conclusive scenarios to beused for formulating piahs. These are based on a review fromthe viewpoints of probability of occurrence as well as the imepact to the SuMi TRUST Group. After estimating amount of lossin the event of occurrence of risks is calculated based on theselected scenarios. This loss is reported to the Board of Direc-tors and others along with an assessment of its impact on thelevel of capital adequacy.

Qualitative Disclosure Items for the Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) on a consolidated basis(1) Items concerning fluctuations in the LCR over time
Our consolidated LCR has trended steadily for the most part in the past two years. Our LCR slightly decreased comparedwith before am1d increases in both high-quality liquid assets (numerator) and cash outflows (denominator) as a result of theBank ofJapan's negative interest rate policy introduced In January 2016.
(2) Items concerning eva1uation of the LCR levelOur consohdated LCR sat1sfies the required cr1teria and we do not expect the LCR to signiﬁcantly ﬂuctuate from thecurrent 1evel. Furthermore, the actual LCR is not significantly different form our forecast.
(3) Items concerning the composition of totals for eligible high~qua|ity liquid assets
The majority of our eligible highequahty liquid assets are reserve deposit held at centre) banks and sovereign bonds.There have been no material fluctuations in the compos1tion 0t currencies, their types and locations. Furthermore, therehas been no material difference between tota1s for eligible highiquality assets and net cash outflows in major currencies,
(4) Other1tems concernlng LCR
For some of borrowings from the trust funds (trust accounts), we apply the treatment for qualifying operaﬁonal deposit.”We regularly estimate the amount he‘d from the sum circulating based on monthly outflows and inflows. We do not applythe “additional collated requ1red to market vamation changes based on the scenario approach.
Furthermore, taking account of the impact to LCR, we are using montheend data in lieu of dai1y data for the consolidatedsubsidiary companies of minor importance with practical restricﬁons.

vetop systems to handle them appropriate‘y.
(1) Credit Risk Management Policy
The basic policy of SuMi TRUST Bank’s risk managementcalls for a dTversTfied credit portfolio and strict credit man-agement for individual credits,” For the former, we are makingefforts to mitigate credit concentration risk by managing, ona sectorebyesector and countryebyecountry basis, the diversifiecation ofthe overaH credit portfolTo, including large borrowers.For the latter, we are managing individual credits in a moreelaborate manner through the operation of credit screening,self-assessment and internal Credit Ratings.
Furthermore, we have set a standard for profitability bytaking into account expected Toss ratios and expense ratesfor each credit rating, and reflect the resu‘ts of this measurement in the terms and conditions of each transaction ina bid to secure profit margins (spreads) commensurate withtheir risk amount to ensure appropriate risk-retum.
SuMi TRUST Bank’s credit risk management covers notonly credit transactions in the banking account but also
transactions in the principal guaranteed trust account.
(2) Credit Risk Management Structure
We have established a credit risk management frameworkunder which various organizations and departments aredosely organized for mutual support and effective checksand balances Relevant organizations and departments as,sume their respective rotes based on the credit strategiesand credit risk management plans formulated by the Boardof Directors as follows:
Sumitomo MTCSUT Trust Ho‘dings, inc 2017 Financial Data Section
1) The Board of Directors decides on important matters related to credit risk management when establishing semian-nua‘ management plans. Based on reports on credit riskmanagement (including the results of asset assessment), theBoard of Directors decides on the credit strategy and economic capital plan, and Its approval of seH—assessment stan-dards and rules for writeeoffs and reserves, through thesedecisions, it strengthens and improves the fund manage,ment base, and ensures the effective use of funds and thesoundness of assets, including assets in trust,
2) The Executive Committee, based on the reports of creditrisk management (including the results of asset assessment),deliberates and decides on the credit strategy and the riskcapital aHocation plan, and brings them to the Board of Di-rectors. Also, the Committee develops and reviews theframework to carry out self—assessment and the calcutation ofwriteeof‘fs and reserves in an appropriate mannerl
3) The Credit Risk Committee deliberates and decides onbasic credit policies as weH as investment and loan transac-tions, and secures the strengthening and improvement ofthe fund management base, the effective use of funds andthe soundness of assets, including assets in trust.
4) The Risk Management Department designs and facilitatesthe management of credit risk in a proper manner as a riskmanagementeretated department pertaining to credit risk,Also, it undertakes credit risk management through themeasurement of credit risk amounts, the monitoring ofcredit portfolios and validation of the appropriateness ofseTf-assessment, write-otfs and reserves, and verifies the ap-
propriateness of the internal ratings system.
5) The Research Department applies Credit Ratings basedon industry research and research on credit evaluation of in-dividual companies along with quantitative analysis, from aneutral standpoint independent ofglobal credit supervision
departments, branches and departments.

6) Each Global Credit Supervision Department screens credittransactions strictly, provides appropriate guidance tobranches and departments, and conduct self—assessment(secondary assessment), and deal with problematic loans
7) Branches and Departments manage credit transacetions appropriately and conduct self—assessment (initialassessment),
8) The Internal Audit Department conducts the internal auditof internal risk management frameworks for various processes.
(3) Credit Risk Management Methods1) Credit Concentration Risk Management
Based on the idea that keeping close tabs on credit ex-posure to each Obligor as the basics of credit risk manage,ment, we manage loans, stocks, otf—balance sheet and othertransactions in a comprehensive and integrated manner. Weplace limits on credit exposures thus calculated and known,and also periodically examine the impact of credit risk real-ization of large obligors and the particular degree of con—centration in industry sectors with large credit exposures,and we report these to the Executive Committee on a quar-terly basis
To manage country risks, we control exposures for eachcountry in which Obligors operate.
2) Credit Ratings and Self—assessment
”Credit Ratings that indicate the credit status of obligorsand the possibility of defaults and losses provide the basis forcredit screening of individual transactions and credit portfoliomanagement. Credit Ratings include: Obligor Ratings for cor-porations that comprise sovereigns and financial institutions;Structured Ratings applicable to structured finance such asreal estate non-recourse loans; and Facility Ratings that reflectthe possibility of loss of individual facilities.
Obligor Ratings use a method that combines a statisticalquantitative model and qualitative assessment that reflectsthe characteristics of individual obligors, providing stage as-sessment in respect of the credit status of obligors and thelikelihood of them defaulting Structured Ratings indicate instages the credit status of obligors and the likelihood 0fthem
defaulting. Evaluations are based on the quantitative andqualitative criteria according to the type of finance such as realestate non-recourse loans, project finance and ship/aircraft fi-nancet Facility Ratings indicate in stages the possibility of loss,according to evaluations based on the case-speciﬁc creditquality (guarantee, collateral, etc.) These Credit Ratings alsoserve as the basis for credit risk calculations using the InternalRatingsebased Approach (the ”IRB Approach”) based on capeital adequacy regulations
We conduct selfeassessmeht basically for all assets in thebanking account and the principal guaranteed trust accounton a regular basis, and determine the classification ofobligors” by assessing client's repayment capacity by theirfinancial standing, cash positions, profit earning capacity,etc, as well as the asset classification according to the riskof assets becoming irrecoverable or impaired in their value,in order to achieve effective credit risk management and ad-equate writeeoffs and reserves,
The credit rating systems and the self—assessment systemare administered in a mutually consistent manner, sharingclient’ basic financial data. Soundness of credit portfolios isaccurately evaluated based on the timely and proper graspof the clients' creditworthiness through the administrationof both systems

3) Credit Risk Quantification
The measurement of credit risk amount is designed toquantitatively grasp the extent as to how far the company'sassets are likely to incur losses from credit events over thecoming year. In particular, based on estimates of defaultrates in each grade of credit rating and recovery rates, wemeasure the difference between the maximum value of badloan losses estimated within the range of certain probabilieties and the expected bad loan loss, which is the averagevalue of estimated bad loan losses, as the credit riskamount The measurement results are reported regularly tothe Board of Directors, etc.
As our risk measurement method, we have adoptedMonte Carlo simulation, which generates a variety of see,narios (100,000 in our case) to plot a distribution of lossesfrom which the maximum value of losses is estimated (Seethe chart below)

In the actual measurement, as our method is designed tofactor in the correlation between individual assets, the riskamount derived reflects not only the quality of assets, butalso the effects of diversification or credit portfolios, There,fore, by regularly monitoring the risk amount, we can ascer-tain the status of our credit risk management policy, Le, ”adiversified credit portfolio and strict credit managementfor individual credits, We also checkthe appropriateness ofcapital allocation and the soundness of business operations
Usually, the measurement of risk amount is conductedusing estimated values calculated based on default ratesand recovery rates, etc. As a complementary measure, wealso conduct “stress testing,” intended to estimate the max-imum possible losses that may arise from a situation thatrepresents an aberration from historical data but could the-oretically occur, We set out multiple scenarios and conductsimulations to see how the risk amount changes in each ofthese scenarios, The results of these tests are reported tothe Board of Directors, etc
We are also working on risk calculation techniques and
the creation of more sophisticated scenarios, correspon-ding to the characteristics of SuMi TRUST Bank’s assetunder out management.

(4) Compliance with Capital Adequacy Regulations1) Measurement of Required Capital via the IRB ApproachAs a method for calculating the amount of credit risk-weighted assets reiated to the calculation of the requiredcapital under capitai adequacy regulations, we have adoptedthe IRB Approach, which uses Credit Ratings and otherinternal data for the management of obligorstIn terms of calculation method, we have adopted the Ad,vanced IRB Approach since the end of March 205, which isprimarily applicabie to domestic corporations and others,
1. Basic Process of the IRB ApproachUnder the IRB Approach, the amount of regulatory re-quired capital is calculated via the following three stages:
(3) Assignment of Credit Ratings (Credit Ratings andCredit Pool Categories)SuMi TRUST Bank develops its own ratings system (Inter,

2. Approaches Applicable to Respective ExposuresUnder capital adequacy regulations, methods of calculateing risk-weights and Credit Ratings used are varied depend-ing on asset classes. Please refer to the table on page 259for the breakdown of calculation methods and Credit Rat-
ings we appiy to respective exposures:
3. Estimated Parameters
As described below, there are three parameters whichmust be estimated in order to caiculate the amount of creditrisk-weighted assets. Exposures with higher leveis of param-eters have higher required capital. In order to ensure objecetivity and accuracy, we use, in principle, the same parametersused for internal risk management purposes for capital adee
quacy regulations as well.
(a) Probability of Default (PD)The prior probability that a single obligor or a single
transaction is likely to default during a specified period.
(b) Loss Given Default (LGD)
The prior estimate of the ratio of a loss likely to be in-curred in the event of a default by a certain obligor or a certain transaction to the exposure at default.
(c) Exposure At Default (EAD)
The likely exposure amount at the time of occurrence ofevents of defauit, inciuding additional credit that may bedrawn from lines of credit or other financing, before a clientdefaults on obiigations.
4. PD- LGD Estimation Method
In our integrated risk management, we estimate PD, LGDand EAD, and we use these estimates as parameters for theIRB Approach under capital adequacy regulations.
For Domestic Credit Ratings, we estimate PD in line withthe definition of default, which equates with the Basel IIdefinition, on the basis of our performance data (the in-ternal historicai data method”). For international credit rat—ings, we estimate PD on the basis of mapping with defaultdata provided by Standard & Poor’s Ratings Services (the“mapping method). In principle, we estimate PD for CreditRatings on the basis of the cumulative detauit rate from the
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Hoidings, inc 20i7 Financial Data Section
internal historical data for the iatest 20 years and by takinginto account applicabie externai data. Fortransactions sub,ject to credit pool management that do not have the rat-ings migration, we estimate PD, in principle, by using theaverage of the actual default rates for the latest 20 yearsWhere the period of accumulation of performance data hasyet to reach 20 years, we estimate PD on the basis of theactual default rates of all years for which the performancedata is available.
LGD (SuMi TRUST Bank’s own estimation applicable prime,rily to domestic corporations and others) is estimated subjectto conservative adjustments that take into consideration potential recessionary phases and other factors, based on theactual recovery data from the defauited ciients.
5. Usage of Various Estimates for Purposes other thanCalculation of Capital Adequacy RatioOur estimates used for caicuiating the capital adequacyratio complying with capitai adequacy regulations are ap-plied for the following items:
(3) Use of Estimated Typical PD and Typical LGDQuantitative measurement of credit risk, controls of
credit limits, etc.
* The lypicai PD and LGD are conservatively estimated to obtain a iongrterm and starbie level by taking into Consideration the impact of economic cycies
(b) Use of Credit RatingsCriteria for authority on crediterelated operations, criteriafor self—assessment, criteria for profitabiiity, etc.
2) Exposures where the Standardized Approach is Applied
The Standardized Approach calculates riskeweighted as,sets by using externai ratings provided by qualified ratingagencies, instead of our own Credit Ratings. We haveadopted the [RB Approach. We, however, use the Standard,ized Approach for business units and transactions excludedfrom the scope of application of the IRB Approach due toits insignificance and other factors.
We use ratings provided by the following qualified ratingagencies to assess risk-weights’ Rating and Investment in-formation, Inc. (R&l); Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd.(JCR);Moody’s Investors Sewice, Inc. (Moody's); S&P Globai Rat-ings (S&P); and Fitch Ratings Ltd. (Fitch).

‘I. Phased RoII-out Exposures
We apply the Standardized Approach to our subsidiaries(business units) that are in the middle of preparatory worktoward the application of the IRB Approach. As of the endof March 20W, two subsidiaries are subject to our “phasedroilout exposures: Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Club; and Sum,itomo Mitsui Trust Bank (Thai) Public Company Limited
2. Carved Out ExposuresWe apply the Standardized Approach to subsidiaries thatundertake iittle credit business, if any, as well as certain trans-actions that are not significant in terms of credit risk manage,ment, carving them out from the IRB Approach. Criteriawhether to carve out business units or transactions from theIRB Approach are made after fully considering their impor-tance with respect to the following points:(a) The size of the expected credit loss and the frequencyof credit provision(b) Rank under the credit portfolio pian or the credit riskmanagement policy
(c) The ratio to overall credit riskeweighted assets
3. Internal Ratings System
(1) Outline of the Internal Ratings System
SuMi TRUST Bank's internal ratings system is intended toensure an appropriate evaiuation process for financial assetsheld by the SuMi TRUST Group (excluding insignificant conesolidated companies), and contribute to profit managementand credit risk management in accordance with the Risk Man,agement Policy. The internal ratings system consists of theCredit Ratings system and credit pools system.
The Credit Ratings system is broadly divided into the domesticratings system (”Domestic Credit Ratings) and the overseas rateings system (“Non—Japanese Credit Ratings”). Each system in—cludes Obligor Ratings that rank the PD of corporations,Structured Ratings that rank the PD of real estate non-recourseloans and project finance, and Facility Ratings that rank the pos-sibility of loss in individual facilities in consideration offactors suchas guarantees, coilateral and duration of credit.
The credit pools system manages smali-Iot loans providedto individuais, such as residential mortgage loans and card
loans, by grouping these tra nsactions with similar risk profiles.
SuMi TRUST Bank maintains credit pool categories, such asaffiliateeguaranteed residential mortgage loans pools andbusiness finance loans pools, divided according to producttype, obligor status, transaction status, collateral coveragestatus and delinquency status.
(2) Administration of the Internal Ratings System
The process related to credit rating assignment comprisesthe “Planning Process for defining ratings and setting pro-cedures and criteria (“Policy on Credit Ratings), the “Impleementation Process” for appropriately appiying the CreditRatings and credit pools assignment criteria, and the Valiedation Process” for ensuring the suitability and objectivity ofCredit Ratings,

Credit Ratings are reviewed in a timeiy manner in responseto changes in the creditworthiness of obligors.
Furthermore, we assign Credit Ratings to clients in acombination of ”quantitative assessment” and ”qualitativeassessment.” “Quantitative assessment is an assessmentbased on the credit rating model, etc, while ”qualitativeassessment is an assessment based on human judgments(expert judgment”), As we take the approach to deter,mine Credit Ratings by combining quantitative assess-ment” and qualitative assessment,” the monitoring oftheobjectivity of “qualitative assessment made by expertjudgment uitimately becomes important in ensuring thesuitabiiity of ratings

1) Procedures for Assigning Domestic Credit Ratings(Obligor Ratings)
1. Subjects to be RatedWe assign Credit Ratings to ail domestic corporate oblige
ors (residents and nonresident Japanese)
2. Quantitative Assessment
In Domestic Credit Ratings, we use the credit rating modelunder which obligors' financiai indicators are explanaton/ vari-ables, and the typical PD is the explained variable. In buildingour Credit Ratings model, we have classified our obligors intofive industry categories of manufacturing, wholesale/retail,sewices (including nonbanks), transportation/communicationsand construction/reai estate in order to reﬂect financial char,acteristics of each industry sector in the assessment, andadopted statistical methods to choose financiai indicators witha high correlation to the PD. Also, for financial data employedto build the model and to assess individual obligors by usingthe model, we use information such as unrealized losses col-lected and analyzed by branches and departments in additionto public financial statements, thus enabling the quantitativeassessment that reflects the actual condition of obligors.
3. Qualitative Assessment
The analysts in the implementation departments responsiblefor assigning sector—by-sector Credit Ratings assess “keiretsu”corporate groupings, industn/ circumstances, external ratings,future cash ﬂow stabiiity and other information that is not re-flected in financial indicators (expertjudgment)
For expertjudgment, the margin of modification is limited,and qualitative assessment items are indicated in writing inorder to contain the arbitrariness of those employees re-sponsibie forthe assignment of Credit Ratings. Furthermore,departments which manage credit risk supervise the content
of revisions to ensure objectivity.

2) Procedure for Assigning International Credit Ratings(Obligor Ratings)
‘I. Subjects to be RatedWe assign Credit Ratings to all overseas obligors (nonresi
idents and non-Japanese),
2. Quantitative Assessment
NonaJapanese Credit Ratings adopt credit rating modeiwhich reproduces externai ratings with financial indicatorsas explanatory variables.
3. Qualitative Assessment
The qualitative assessment ratings by expert judgmentare determined to be in line with qualitative assessment criateria for Domestic Credit Ratings and also by incorporatingassessment factors not used in Japan as weli as of externairatings and the comparison with competitors, and iimits areimposed on the margin of modification for each item of as,sessment. Furthermore, departments which manage creditrisk supervise the content of revisions to ensure objectivity.
3) Procedure for Assigning Structured Ratings1. Subjects to be Rated
Structured Ratings are assigned to structured financeprojects with the cash flows generated from specific fienanced assets or businesses as the source of principal and
interest payments.
2. Quantitative Assessment
Two indicators are used for the quantitative assessmentof Structured Ratings, for example in terms of reai estatenonarecourse loans: (i) the loan to value (LTV), which is theratio of the amount of ioans taken out or bonds issued tothe appraised value of the subject asset; and (ii) the debtservice coverage ratio (DSCR), which is the ratio of net cashflow to the amount of interest on loans or bonds plus con,tracted principai payments. By combining these two indica-tors, we assess default risk during a given period and thecertainty of redemptions by the sale of subject property atmaturity and/or refinancing,
In addition, we assess the DSCR conservatively in antici-pation of changes in the environment during a given period,
3. Qualitative Assessment
In a real estate non-recourse loan, for example, in casessuch as when a highly creditworthy tenant has undertaken aIong-term lease contract, the assessment by expertjudgment,in some cases, adjusts the rating level by taking these factorsinto consideration.
Since Structured Ratings are strongly individuaiized depend,ing on specific transactions, we ensure the objectivity of ratingsassigned by monitoring the adequacy of qualitative assess,ment at credit risk management related departments.
4) Procedure for Assigning Facility Ratings1. Subjects to be Rated
We assign Facility Ratings to loans (including acceptancesand guarantees, as well as commitment lines) to corpora-tions, sovereigns and financial institutions subject to Domes,tic Credit Ratings (obligor ratings).
2. Assessment MethodFaciiity Ratings provide ratings that rank the possibility ofloss in individuai faciiities based on factors such as guaran-
tees, coilateral and duration of credit,

5) Procedures for Assignment of Credit Pool Categories1. Transactions Subject to Credit Pool Categorization
A credit pool is a group of transactions with similar risk pro-files with regard to risks relating to the obiigors as well as thetransactions. In principle, SuMi TRUST Bank applies the creditpool management approach to smailelot loans provided to in,dividuals, etc However, business ﬁnance loans to individualswith an outstanding balance of ¥100 million or higher, are as,signed Obligor Ratings and managed individually.
2. Assignment of Credit Pool Categories
Regarding credit subject to the credit pooi managementapproach, loans are divided into several categories accord-ing to several categories according to product type, obligorstatus, transaction status, collateral coverage status anddelinquency status. The loans are divided into three sub,quaiifying re-volving retail exposure and ”other retail exposures,”
categories' “residential mortgage exposure,
Assignment into credit pool categories is carried out by theimplementation departments based on product type, trans-action status and other factors.
4. Market Risk Management
Market risk refers to the risk that the SuMi TRUST Groupincurs losses due to ﬂuctuations in the value of assets/liaebilities (including oft-balance sheet assets/liabilities), or inthe earnings generated from assets/liabilities, due to fluctuations in various market risk factors, such as interestrates, foreign exchange rates, stocks, commodities, andcredit spreads. Of this, market liquidity risk” in particularmeans risk that the SuMi TRUST Group incurs lossescaused in a situation where it becomes impossible to con-duct transactions in the market or becomes obiigatory totrade at prices significantly disadvantageous than usuaidue to market turmoil.
We are buiiding a more advanced market risk manage-ment system, after considering the impact on markets offluctuations of such factors as interest rates and foreign ex-change rates foilowing the monetary easing by the Bankof Japan.

(1) Market Risk Management Policy
In managing market risk, we aim to ensure adequate prof,its commensurate with the strategic targets, scale and char-acteristics of the business ofthe SuMi TRUST Group, We aredoing this by improving the management system, alongwith ensuring its operational soundness by adequate controlover risks.
(2) Market Risk Management Framework
1)The Board of Directors approves and determines theALM Basic Pian and a risk management pian as importantmatters reiated to market and funding liquidity risk under
management plans on a semiannuai basis
2) The Executive Committee deliberates and decides on asemiannual basis the ALM Basic Plan and a risk managementplan referred by the ALM Committee. In addition, based onreports on the status of market risk management, the Execuetive Committee implements measures to deveiop and im-prove the framework for facilitating control functions.
3) The ALM Committee plans on a semiannual basis theALM Basic Plan on a company-wide comprehensive risk op-erational management basis for assets/iiabilities as well asa risk management plan related to market and funding iiquideity risk. The ALM Committee is held on a monthly basis andcontrols market and funding liquidity risks on a consolidatedbasis, and strives to ensure the soundness ofthe composition
of assets and liabilities as well as stability of earnings.
4) As a middie office independent from departments re,sponsible for market trading (front office) and departmentsresponsible for business processing (back office), the RiskManagement Department is in a position to ensure proper
controi functions among the front and back offices.
5) The Internal Audit Department conducts internal audit,ing of the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk manage-ment framework.

(3) Market Risk Management Methods
We grasp the market risks within the SuMi TRUST Groupand establish the risk limits and loss limits at each principaicompany according to the ALM Basic Plan. Status of adher-ence to the aforementioned iimits is reported to the membersof the ALM Committee on a daily basis. Reports are presentedon a regular basis mainly to the Board of Directors as well asthe ALM Committee. The reports reiated to compound riskanalyses inciuding grasping the sensitivity to risk factors byposition, management of precursors of volatility in riski‘actorsand emergency preparedness using stress tests, all as part ofa muiti-faceted risk management process combining qualita-
tive and quantitative aspects.
(4) Market Risk Measurement ModelMarket risk is quantified using VaR as a measurement stan-dard, with confidence interval and holding period defined asfoliows:Confidence interval:99%Holding period:Trading: 10 daysBaangALM-reiated positions: 63 days (3 months)Credit investment andstrategic investment: 260 days (‘i year)Others: 2i days (i month)Furthermore, we are conducting stress tests in order tocomplement the limited effectiveness of the VaR measure-
ment, which is affected by market fluctuations in the past
observation period. Amounts of expected loss from the cur-rent portfolio are regularly estimated, assuming scenariosbased on the past maximum fluctuation as weil as forecastedfuture movement of each risk factor.
(5) Compliance with Capital Adequacy Regulations1) Calculation of Market Risk Equivalent
The market risk equivaient refers to the sum of market riskin the trading account and foreign exchange risk and com-modities risk in accounts other than the trading account,which is a factor used to calcuiate capital adequacy ratio. Wecaicuiate the market risk equivaient mainly by applying theInternal Models Approach*.
‘ We apply the Standardized Approach concerning individuai risks at the parent com-pany and exchange rate risks at consolidated subsidiaries.
We validate the reliability and effectiveness ofthe internalmodel by conducting back testing.
2) Outlier Ratio
Regarding the amount of interest rate risk for the bankingaccount under the current capitai adequacy regulations,when economic vaiue calculated“ under a certain interestrate fluctuation scenario*2 declines by more than 20% oftotal capital (Tiert capital + Tier 2 capital), 3 bank falls underthe category of “outlier banks,” and remedial actions to im-prove its stability will be made, The outlier ratio is obtainedby dividing the overaii amount of interest rate risk by totalcapitai, As indicated by the table on page 319, our outlierratio (on a consolidated basis) was 3.4% as of March 31,2017, keeping us out of the category of outlier banks. Theamount of interest rate risk in the banking account, theamount of interest rate risk for internal management pureposes and the overall amount of interest rate risk used forcaicuiating the outlier ratio are not necessarily the same because of differences in the measurement method, calcula-
tion conditions and other matters.
*1 Our risk measurement method uses the interest rate sensitivity approach. Core derposits are deﬁned as the lowest of the ioiiowing three, as an upper limit, for theﬁve-year maturity (the average term oF2 5 years): 1) the lowest balance of depositsin the past five years, 2) the balance ieh aher deducting the maximum annuai out-ﬂow of deposits m the past {we years from the current baiance otdepos-ts; or 3) theamount equivaient to 50% cf the current baiance of deposits
‘2 Our interest rate ﬂuctuation scenario assumes an interest rate shock consisting ofthe 1st and 99th percentile otthe fluctuation of interest rates measured (or the oneyear holding period and the minimum observation period oHive years tor the Japanrese yen, u s doiiar and Euro
Regarding currencies which account for less than 5% of our overaii assets or iiabii-mes, we uniformly use a paraliel shiit of200 baSis paints upward or downward as aninterest rate ﬂuctuation scenario.

5. Funding Liquidity Risk Management
Funding iiquidity risk refers to the risk that the SuMiTRUST Group incurs losses in a situation where it becomesimpossible to secure necessary funds or becomes obligatoryto raise funds at interest rates signiﬁcantly higher than usual.
We are buiiding a more advanced funding liquidity risk man-agement system, after considering the needs for the compli-ance with new giobal standards (e.g. Basel H1) in terms ofbanks' capitai adequacy and liquidity.
(1) Funding Liquidity Risk Management Policy
As a basic principle, SuMi TRUST Bank adequately man-ages funding liquidity risks based on a policy that seeks a bal-ance between two pillars: the cost and constant availabilityotfunding through diversiﬁed sources of ﬁnancing, and pre-paredness for emergencies through veriﬁcation of fundingcapabilities under a stress environment and the prior reviewof countermeasures. Our balancing of these two pillars is withtull recognition that such risks, in the event they materiaiized,could directiy lead to the collapse of the SuMi TRUST Group.
(2) Funding Liquidity Risk Management FrameworkFunding iiquidity risks are managed under a simiiar frameworkas the aforementioned market risk management framework.
(3) Funding Liquidity Risk Management Methods
As criteria fortunding liquidity risk management, risk iimits ona cempany-wide basis and by business base, as weH as by cur—rency of denomination are set out, along with actions to be takenin the event efa breach of such limits, under the ALM Basic Pian,where status of adherence to such criteria is being monitored ona daily basis. Meanwhile, SuMi TRUST Bank identifies the amountof funds necessary in the event of materiaiization of funding liq,uidity risks. It achieves the identification of the amount of fundsnecessary by carrying out stress tests based on several scenariossuch as abrupt changes in the market environment and changesin the funding environment specific to the SuMi TRUST Group.
As part of preparedness against exposure to funding liquidityrisk, four classiﬁed phases of funding conditions (Normal, EarlyWarning, Potential Crisis, and Crisis) are assumed, dependingon the extent of its cash crunch. We monitor at ail times, includeing normal conditions, the occurrence ofqualitative and quanti—tative events that may have an impact on liquidity as Early
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Hoidings, tnc 2017 Financial Data Section
Warning Indicators. Simultaneously, we formulate contingencyplans as part of crisis management measures. The practicality of
contingency plans is ensured through periodical driils‘
6. Operational Risk Management
Operational risk refers to the risk that the SuMi TRUSTGroup incurs losses resulting from inappropriate businessprocesses, the activities of executives or employees and com,puter systems as well as from external events, and is classifiedinto business processing risk, system risk, information securityrisk, legal and compliance risk, human resource risk, event riskand reputational risk for the purpose of risk management.
We will further enhance our operationai risk manage-ment framework to remain prepared mainly for new risksthat may emerge in association with the development in in-
formation technoiogy.
(1) Operational Risk Management Policy
In developing an operationai risk management system,we make it a principie to carry out adequate risk manage-ment in accordance with the scale and characteristics ofbusinesses and risks involved, in an effort to ensure sound-ness and appropriateness of their businesses. This is basedon the recognition that operationai risk is something un-avoidable in the course of business execution.
(2) Operational Risk Management Structure
1) The Board of Directors summarizes the matters to be ad-dressed overthe entire process of operational risk manage,ment along with specific actions, and it sets out the “RiskManagement Plan (Operational Risk),” which is reviewedregularly or as necessary, on the basis of reports on the op-
erational risk management situation.
2) The Executive Committee maintains the proper conditions for operational risk management, such as establishingthe Operational Risk Management Committee and opera,tional risk management-related departments including de-partments responsible for comprehensive management ofoperational risk and departments responsibie for the man-agement of respective risk subcategories.
===================================================

3) In the Operationai Risk Management Committee, the ex-ecutive officers in charge of the operationai risk manage,ment-reiated departments and the general managers of thedepartments responsible for supervising each businessreceive reports on operational risk information includingsignificant losses associated with operational risk whileengaging in deiiberation and consultation on these mat-
ters as necessary,
4) The Risk Management Department, which has overall re,sponsibility for operationai risk management, is committed todeveloping and enhancing the SuMi TRUST Groupewide opereational risk management system, in coordination with the de-partments responsible for managing the subcategory risks.
5) The departments responsible for managing the subcateegory risks are committed to deveioping and enhancing theSuMi TRUST Groupewide risk management system in each
respective subcategory.
6) The Internal Audit Department conducts internal auditof the adequacy and effectiveness of the risk manage-
ment system.
(3) Operational Risk Management Methods
Operational risks involved in all areas ofthe SuMi TRUSTGroup's business, including outsourced business, are sub,ject to operational risk management, which adequatelyidentifies and assesses risk from both qualitative and quanetitative perspectives. Meanwhile, preventative measuresagainst risk materialization, as well as responses in theevent of materialization, causal analysis and recurrence-prevention measures are formulated to mitigate opera,tionai risk.
Management regarding Operationai Accidents
As a countermeasure against operationai accidents, suchas incidents in which SuMi TRUST Bank and/or its client(s)suffer Toss as a result of inappropriate handling of businessmatters, SuMi TRUST Bank is improving its reporting andmanagement systems for operational accidents, to ensure
proper handiing of accidents at the time oftheir occurrence,prevention and elimination thereof, as well as to improvethe quaiity of business process.
In the event of an operational accident, a concerned/in-voived department registers the accident with a reportingsystem, whereby it shall promptly be reported to the depart,ments responsible for the businesses and the operationalrisk management. Furthermore, depending on the signifiecance of the accident, such as the scope of its impacts andthe size of associated loss, the report shall further be escaelated to the bodies such as the Operational Risk Manage-ment Subcommittee, Operational Risk ManagementCommittee and the Executive Committee. Upon receivinginstructions from the departments responsible for the busienesses, the department involved in the accident shail pro-vide a prompt and appropriate response to clients, while itinvestigates and analyzes the causes of its occurrence, as itconsiders, develops and implements the measures to prevent its reoccurrence‘
For the purpose of periodicai analysis, the departmentsresponsible for the businesses analyze the trends andcauses of operational accidents in their respective business,and develop measures to prevent reoccurrence as deemedeffective across the entire business. The operationai riskmanagement-related departments deveiop and reviewmeasures to prevent reoccurrence as deemed effective froma company-wide and cross-depai‘tmental point of view‘
(4) Business Processing Risk Management Activities
Business processing risk refers to the risk that the SuMiTRUST Group incurs losses due to inappropriate businessprocedures arising from executives or employees neglect-ing to engage in proper business activities, or other inciedents such as accidents or fraud. Engaging in a broad rangeof businesses including banking, asset management, assetadministration and real estate, SuMi TRUST Bank recognizesthat business processing risk is something unavoidable inthe course of business execution. SuMi TRUST Bank is pro-cessing risk management in accordance with the scale andcharacteristics of business operations and risk so as to en-sure peace of mind and satisfaction for is clients.

(6) Information Security Risk Management Activities
Information security risk refers to the risk that the SuMiTRUST Group incurs losses because information assets arenot properly maintained or managed. This includes infor7mation leaks, incorrect information, an inability to use theinformation system and misuse of information. Since the in,formation asset is one of the critical management resourcesinvolving the risk that could disrupt the basis of manage,ment, SuMi TRUST Bank adequately maintains and managesall information assets under its care,
The IT & Business Process Planning Department, which isresponsible for information security risk management, iscommitted to developing and enhancing an information se-curity risk management system,
SuMi TRUST Bank places degrees of importance on all in-formation assets under its care according to the severity ofpotential losses that SuMi TRUST Bank and clients may incurin the event of their leaks, loss or alteration.

(8) Compliance with Capital Adequacy Requirements
1) Calculation of Operational Risk Equivalent AmountSince the end of March 2014, SuMi TRUST Bank has
adopted the Advanced Measurement Approach in lieu of
the Standardized Approach, which was used previously, in
the calculation of the operational risk equivalent amount
under capital adequacy requirements.
Exceptionally, we adopt the Basic IndicatorApproach fora portion of the corporations deemed less important in thecalculation of the operational risk equivalent amount andcorporations that are in preparation for the adoption of theAdvanced Measurement Approach.
2) Outline of the Advanced Measurement Approach1. Measurement Framework
SuMi TRUST Bank calculates the operational risk equivaientamount by aggregating “each maximum loss amounts of op,erational risk expected over a period of one year, with a one-sided confidence intervai of 999% (hereinafter ”VaR),” foreach ofthe eight quantification units (all businesses, corporatemanagement sections and earthquakes) that are based on theconsistency between management regarding operational ac-cidents and profit management.
The operational risk equivalent amount is calcuiatedusing the four elements that are prerequisites forthe adopetion at the Advanced Measurement Approach, i.e. internalloss data, external loss data, business environment and theinternal controi tactors, and scenario analysis, as well as thequantification model, The results of the calculation are utieIized in activities to enhance operational risk management,including the deliberation of measures to improve the inter,nai control factors.
Additionally, in the calcuiation of the operational riskequivaient amount, we do not reflect the mitigating effectsof insurance, and do not exclude expected loss or conductadjustments based on the correiation between the quantifi-cation units,

2. Scenario Analysis
In order to accurately understand SuMi TRUST Bank’s riskprofile, we identify events involving a large amount of lossesassociated with operational risk that cannot be covered byinternal loss data alone when we conduct scenario analysis.We also construct scenario data that estimate loss amountand probability of such events‘
The evaluation results of elements including the businessenvironment and the internal control factors are reflected inthe subjects to the construction of scenario data, and theestimation of loss amount and frequency.
In addition, we ensure the objectivity, accuracy and comepleteness of the constructed scenario data by conducting ver-
ification using both internal loss data and external loss data.
0 Outline of the Quantification Framework
3. Quantification Model
The VaR of each measurement unit is calculated by plottingfrequency distributions and severity distribution based on theinternal loss data and the scenario data prepared through thescenario analysis, and expressed through Monte Carlo simu—lation that mixes such distributions and estimates the totalseverity distribution
The Poisson distribution has been applied to the frequency distribution, and our own distribution method hasbeen applied to severity distribution in order to grasp theamount of tail risk
We confirm the appropriateness of the quantificationmodel and the results of the VaR calculations by conductingperiodic verifications such as back testing.

7. Other Related Matters
(1) Securitization Exposures
Securitization is a transaction where credit risks of multipleunderlying assets are divided into two or more differentclasses forming a senior and subordinated structure, and arethen transferred partially or wholly to third parties. Well,known such products, by type of underlying assets, includeresidential mortgageebacked securitles (RMBS), commercialmortgage-backed securities (CMBS) and collateralized loanobligations (CLO), apart from reesecuritization productsbacked by securitization products. In a securitization transac-tlon, credit risk measurements differ between an originator,who brings securitized products to the market, and an in-vestor, who purchases securitization exposures. The originaetor does not bear any credlt risk, if such risk is completelytransferred in a securitizatlon transaction, but is left with somecredit risk, if it accepted a subordinated portion in designingsecuritized products. The investor who purchased securitizedproducts naturally bears credit risk inherent in such products.Meanwhile, reesecuritization products, as they are backed bysecuritization products, make it more difﬁcult to identify therlsks involved, and may carry higher credit risk than ordinary
securitization products.
We partlcipate in the securitization market principally asan investor, but also have a track record of designing secueritized products as an originator. We are also in the businessofapproprlately managing underlying assets for investors asa trustee in securitization, though we do not bear credit riskin doing so,
1) Management Policy of Securitization Exposures1. Investor
In principle, we invest in securitization products assignedwith high external ratings, and we manage risks by assigningcredit ratlngs (structured ratings) according to our internalcredit ratings system. During the investment periods, we reg,ularly monitor not only external ratings but also the statusand performance of the underlying assets of each securitizaetion product, risk characteristics and the status of structuresof the securitization transactions, whlch are reflected in a re,view of credit ratings to ensure stable earnings opportunities.In principle, reesecurltization products are also subjected to
a similar risk management.

We are considering the possibility of making more activeuse of securitization transactions, with the SuMi TRUST BankGroup as an originator, as a means of controlling our loanportfolio. In doing so, we plan to design transactions thatwould effectively realize the intended transfer of credit risks,and also calculate credit risk-weighted assets we bear aftersecuritization in an appropriate manner, The SuMi TRUSTBank Group engages in securitization transactions of assetspurchased from third parties, along with the assets held byaffiliated companies within the scope 0t consolidation oftheholding company. in both cases, we adopt schemes involveing the use at trusts as conduits for the purpose of securiti-zation, where the trust beneficiary rights with respect to theretained subordinated portion remain our exposure.
While securitization products originated by the SuMiTRUST Bank Group are, in principle, held by investors out-side the scope of consolidation of SuMi TRUST Holdings,some are held by SBI Sumishin Net Bank, Ltd., an affiliatedcompany of the SuMi TRUST Bank Group.
2) Accounting Policies for Securitization Transactions
In implementing securitization transactions, we have adopteda method of sale that recognizes the extinguishment of financialassets with the transferto others of control of contractual rightsover ﬁnancial assets, in line with accounting standards for ﬁnan-cial products. In the case of loans, for example, we recognizethe extinguishmeht of assets, in principle, when the transfer ofassets is legally completed and the payment for the transfer isreceived. In the case where we hold retained equity after theexecution of a securitization transaction, we do not recognizethe sale of assets for a portion related to the retained equityconcerned, and include it in credit riskeweighted assets. On theother hand, in transactions involving a considerable amount ofcredit provision without prior payment of fund, an accountingtreatment is adopted in which raised funds are recorded as a li-ability. Meanwhile, assets held for the purpose of securitizationtransactions are valued according to the accounting standardsforfinancial instruments, and recorded in the banking account.
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, lnc 20l7 Financial Data Section
3) Management Method of Securitization Exposures
In calculating the amount of credit risk for securitization ex—posures, we use specific individual credit ratings assigned tosecuritization exposures, and measure the risk amount inmuch the same way as with ordinary corporate exposures. Infterest rate risk associated with securitization exposures is sub-ject to the calculation of market risk.
4) Compliance with Capital Adequacy Regulations
In calculating credit riskeweighted assets in securitizationexposure, we prioritize calculation methods and choose themost applicable calculation methods. For securitization ex,posures assigned with qualifying external ratings, we use anexternal ratingsebased approach” to calculate risk, weights,For securitization exposures without qualifying external rat-ings, we apply the ”supervisory formula commensurate withthe characteristics of underlying assets to the calculation ofriskeweights. Securitization exposures to which neither oftheabove-mentioned approaches can be applied are deductedfrom total capital, The total of capital charges against securietization exposures held is not to exceed the amount of re-quired capital in the case where the [RB Approach is appliedto underlying assets
Qualifying rating agencies we use when we calculate creditrisk-weighted assets with the “External Ratings-Based Ap-proach are Rating and Investment Information, lnc. (R&I);Japan Credit Rating Agency, Ltd. (JCR); Moody's InvestorsService, Inc (Moody's); S&P Global Ratings (S&P); and FitchRatings Ltd. (Fitch).
While securitization exposure is in principle subject to creditrisk-weighted calculations, we use the standardized approachwhen calculating market riskeweighted equivalents,
(2) Banking Account Equity Exposures
We purchase equities through the banking account aspart of our investment operations, and also make capitalparticipation in organizations that can be expected to bringbenefits to us and acquire equities in our clients to help
strengthen business relations with them.

‘|) Management Policy for Banking Account Equity
Exposures
While some of the equities we hold are intended to gainshort term investment returns or returns pertaining to long,term business relations, listed stocks are marked to market andare therefore exposed to the risk of market price fluctuations.
We measure the risk of equity exposures by broadly clas-sifying them into those iisted and unlisted, For iisted equityexposures with market prices, we recognize the volatility ofmarket prices as risk, and measure equity VaR with an estiemated hoiding period ofone month, and the one-tailed 99%conﬁdence intervai, in the same way as with other market risksin the banking account, such as interest-rate risk.
Regarding unlisted equities, for which market price flucetuations cannot be observed directly, the amount of risk witha one year holding period is measured by the method of in,directly estimating the voiatility of an appropriate alternativeindicator or by invoking the PD/LGD Approach prescribedunder capital adequacy reguiations.
As stocks of consolidated subsidiaries are canceled outwith capital accounts of such subsidiaries on the consoiiedated financial statement, capital on the consolidated finan-cial statement is affected not by price fluctuations of equitiesof subsidiaries but by fluctuations of prices of assets held bysubsidiaries. Thus, the risk to be measured is not the risk ofthe vaiue of stocks held declining but the credit risk andmarket risk directly borne by subsidiaries. In contrast, therisk to be measured for equity method affiliates is the risk
of the value of stockholdings deciining.
2) Management Method of Banking Account Equity
Exposures
Under capital adequacy regulations, we apply different risk cal,culation methods for domestic and overseas equity exposures.
As for domestic equities, equity exposures to obligorsand listed companies are calculated with the regulatory for-mula using credit ratings assigned. We apply the simpiiﬁedapproach to exposures of domestic stocks without creditratings and overseas equities, and calculate risk assets bymultiplying those exposures by risk-weights set separatelyfor listed and unlisted equities,
(3) Credit Risk Mitigation Measures
Controls of credit exposures can be achieved not simplyby reducing the balance of outstanding credit but aiso byseeking to loan protection via collateral and guaranteesThese protection measures are coliectively called ”creditrisk mitigation techniques.
While we measure the creditworthiness of clients comeprehensively by iooking at their business status and techno-logical capabilities as well as their future potentiai, we alsoemploy the credit risk mitigation techniques in order tocover deficiencies in creditworthiness or enhance the qualityof loans.
In doing this, it is necessary for the credit risk mitigationtechniques to be “valid” both legally and practicaliy. Inorder to ensure that validity, we set internai standards forsound and reliable protection and management.
1) Collateral
While collaterai cannot be determined uniformly due tovarying specific circumstances of obiigors, we accept collateeral that is most suitable for the use and character of loansand has good security qualifications.
We investigate and assess collateral in a prudent manner,bearing in mind the degree of difficulty in actual disposaland realization of collateral as weli as iegal iimitations andeconomic constraints.
Principal coliaterai we accept includes the following:
0 Commercial bills before maturity that fully meet statue
tory requirements with settlement certainty
O Yenedenominated time deposits and deposits at notice
with us
O Beneficiary rights of principal of designated money in
money trusts or beneficiary rights of principal and in-come of such trusts with us
O Beneficiary certificates of loan trusts with us (both reg,
istered and bearer form)
O Public and corporate bonds, listed stocks and securities
investment trusts (bearer form)
O Land or land and buildings located for manageability,
ease of disposal and with certain coilateral quaiity
O Ships with certain collateral quality, etc.

2) Guarantees
Guarantees are classified into several types, including spe-cific debt guarantees covering only specific debts and refvolving guarantees. In any event, we recognize guaranteesthat are consistent with our validity criteria for the effects ofcredit risk mitigation, including those with confirmed guar-antee capacity and guarantee intentions, and also recognizeguaranteed transactions in the process of screening creditapplications, While we broadly recognize the validity of guaraantees not only with formal guarantee agreements but alsounder signed memorandums and commitments to guaran-tee depending on accompanying terms and conditions, weset requirements for documents and other materials used toconfirm potential guarantors' abilities and intentions of pro,viding guarantees and give importance to the substantiveeffectiveness of guarantees instead of simply relying on writ,ten guarantee agreements.
3) Offset
We net loans owned against deposits from the samecounterparty, in principle, on the basis ofJapanese laws andonly with Clients who have concluded bank transactionagreements containing clauses for timely netting.
4) Netting
When we conduct derivatives transactions and repurachase agreement transactions, we conclude, in principle,legally valid bilateral netting agreements (ISDA masteragreements, etc.) with counterparties. When reasons forearly termination emerge, we mitigate credit risk by invokingbilateral netting agreements for the closeout netting of mul-
tiple derivatives transactions and repurchase agreement
Sumitomo Mitsui Trust Holdings, lnc 20l7 Financial Data Section
transactions concluded with counterparties concerned. Weare also pushing for the conclusion of the Credit SupportAnnex (CSA) as associated agreements to ISDA masteragreements in order to minimize credit risk in derivativestransactions. CSAs are bilateral agreements for credit en,hancement, under which we and CSA counterparties calcu-late the present value of a derivatives transaction and theparty with revaluation loss provides the other party with unirealized gains via collateral with the value equivalent to therevaluation loss,
Collateral is offered and received on a continuing basisbetween us and the CSA cou nterparty to make the revaluaation gain/loss neutral. When the creditworthiness of oneparty deteriorates and is downgraded, however, the needarises to offer additional collateral* to account for the im-
pact of the downgrade.
‘The value oi additional collateral varies depending on individual agreements WithCSA counterpartiesv
5) Compliance with Capital Adequacy Regulations
The capital adequacy regulations narrowly define typesand requirements of credit risk mitigation techniques thatcan be used to mitigate riskaweighted assets in the calculation of credit risk-weighted assets. As described above, wemake use of credit risk mitigation techniques as much aspossible, and set the scope otthe credit risk mitigation tech-niques that can be applied to the calculation of our capitaladequacy ratio as follows, after scrutinizing their eligibilityfor the notified requirements:
1. Qualifying Financial Asset Collateral
0 Netting of loans against deposits (limited to jurisdic-tions where netting is authorized in a stable manner andalso based on judicial precedents, etc., with offsetagreements in place), deposits as collateral
0 Legally valid bilateral netting agreements and credit en-hancement by CSA, regarding derivatives transactionsand repurchase agreement transactions
0 Listed securities (Acceptable listed securities are shares.When accepting shares as qualifying financial assets colalateral, we take into consideration the relationship be-
tween the obligor and the issuer of the shares)

ing Assets Collateral
0 Qualifying real estate asset coilateral (land oniy or landand accompanying buildings, foundation)
0 Other qualifying asset collateral (ships etc)
3. Guarantee and Credit Derivatives0 We accept guarantees mainly from pubiic-sector organi-zations and business enterprises (guarantors) and purechase credit derivatives mainly from financial institutions(protection providers), Legally valid agreements, whichappropriately provide the rights for guarantee and pro-tection unharmed, are classified as quaiifying instruments
so that credit risk mitigation effects are ensuredi
6) Regarding the concentration of credit and market risksresulting from the use of credit risk mitigation techniques0 Guarantees and credit derivatives are deemed to in-
voive concentration risk.
‘ Guarantors tend to be the parent companies of obligeors, and we are not relying on any particular guarantors.In our controls ofthe credit limits regarding an obligor,we monitor and control concentration risk through totaimanagement of the entire group to which the obligorbelongs regardless of whether a guarantee is providedby the parent or not.
0 The total notional principal amount of credit derivativespurchased by SUM] TRUST Bank is not significant ascredit risk. We manage the notional principal amount as
part of the credit limis for the protection provider.
(4) Credit Risk in Market TradingApproach to Manage Credit Risk in Market Trading
When conducting market trading with financial institu-tions as counterparties, credit risk as well as market riskarises, making it necessary to conduct appropriate risk man-agement in accordance with the types of transactions. Inorder to contain credit risks associated with repetitive mar-ket trades with specific counterparties within a certain range,we are managing such risks by establishing credit lines forrespective counterparties,
In terms of posting of exposure, in principie, we treat prin-cipal or notionai principal in contracted market trades ascredit equivaients‘ We calculate these by appiying the cur-rent exposure method in principle for derivatives transacations. We aiso apply the same method to the calculationof credit equivaients regarding transactions with long set,tlement periods where the period between trade date anddelivery date exceeds a certain predetermined period, Reagarding these market trades, the middle office controlscredit limits integrally for both onabaiance sheet and off,balance sheet transactions on a monthly basis and man-ages credit lines in an appropriate manner,

The establlshment of the Corporate Governance Code hasprompted listed companies to aim for greater transparency inmanagement from the perspective of investors, and the estab—lishment of the Stewardship Code has led institutional investorsto step up efforts to exercise voting rights in the interests of ben—eﬁciaries, through measures such as dialogue wlth companles.

I Topics for Future Focus
Foreign Currency Deposits
Although foreign currency deposits are now in widespreaduse, the balance of foreign currency deposits in Japan stillamounts to only a small percentage of yen deposits. However,in Japan, which depends on foreign countries for resources andfood, the price of imports soars when the yen weakens signiﬁ-cantly. From the perspective of protecting clients’ asset value(purchasing power), it is possible to offset the negative impactof inflated import prices by holding a certain amount of foreigncurrency deposits, We propose foreign currency deposits to cli—ents as a tool to hedge their risks.
Enhancing Interest Risk Management for Mortgage Loans
Loans to individual clients are sometimes repaid in advancedue to trends in market interest rates, Mortgage loans in partic—ular require a high degree of interest risk management becausethe amounts are high and the terms are long. In light of theintroduction of previously unseen monetary policies such asnegative interest rates and yield curve control, we will steadilyenhance our risk management in order to offer high»quality,low-priced mortgage loans to clients.

Risk Appetite Framework (RAF)
1. Positioning of Risk Appetite Framework
The Risk Appetite Framework (RAF) is a group-wide businessmanagement framework made up at the process tor decidingthe types and ieveis of risk that SuMi TRUST Hoidings is wiilingto take, within its risk capacity, in order to achieve its manage—ment strategies formuiated by management based on theGroup’s sociai role and management policies, together with theinternai control system underpinning that process.
2. Operation of Risk Appetite
Deciding Risk Appetite
The Group's risk appetite is decided in accordance with themanagement plans, based on management strategies and verirfication through stress tests.
The Group reviews risk appetite as needed, at least once a year.
in setting risk appetite, the Group identities the main risks(risk characteristics), inciuding credit risk, market risk, informa—tion security risk, and conduct risk, to which each business isexposed according to the nature of its operations.
Monitoring of Risk Appetite
The Group sets risk appetite indicators to clarify risk appe—tite, and monitors them regulariy. If the risk appetite indicatorsdeviate from the set ievels, the Group analyzes the cause of the
The Group’s RAF aims primariiy to both strengthen proﬁt-abiiity and enhance risk management, and promotes the real,ization of those goals through environmental assumptions andrisk awareness, and increasing the transparency of risk-takingthrough the setting, communication, and oversight of riskappetite, appropriate aliocation of management resources, andmonitoring of operational status.
deviation, and then takes countermeasures or revises the ievels.
Risk Governance
Risk governance, which forms part of corporate governance,is a system to identify, measure, manage and controi risks byciarifying and monitoring risk appetite and risk iimit.
We promote the enhancement of risk governance, aimingfor the sound development of the Group.
SuMi TRUST Hoidings strives to enhance operation ofrisk appetite through measures such as establishing the RiskCommittee and the Conﬂicts of Interest Committee as part ofits initiatives to enhance corporate governance which includethe transition to a company with Three Committees.”

Advances in liberalization andinternationalization of finance
The first oil crisis in 1973 signaled the endof Japan’s rapid economic rowth. Whilecorporate demand for bank oans declinedconsiderably, sluggish tax revenue and anincrease in iscal spending led the govern-ment to issue a large number of nationalbonds, which were underwritten primarilyby financial institutions. This was a key tac-tor in clearing the way for the liberalizationof finance. Around the same time, the rapidadvance of internationalization resultingfrom overseas expansion by Japanesecompanies and legal revisions provided afurther push toward financial liberalization.In the late 19805, the Japanese economyentered a phase of expansion known asthe bubble economy. The trend towardliberalization and internationalization in thefinancial industry grew even stronger, andbrought new earning opportunities.

Financial reorganization and enhancement of service
The bubble economy came to a dose in 1991, and the Japanese economy entered along period of stagnation. As the financial environment underwent dramatic chang-es, including the injection of public funds into financial institutions, the structureof the financiai system came under examination, and in 1992 the Financial SystemReform Act was established. As a result] cross~participation between various financiaibusinesses became possible through subsidiaries in different business areas.
The economy continued to pick up from 2002 until the latter half of 2007, but thegiobal financial crisis triggered by the sub-prime loan problem and the collapseof Lehman Brothers led to deterioration in the Japanese economy as well. Amidrepeated turmoil in financial markets in the foiiowin ears, including the Greekdebt crisis, countries around the world came out witﬁ Farge—scale fiscal and mon-eta policies such as the introduction of negative interest rates, which resulted in agra ual shift toward economic recovery.
In the financial industry, the Trust Act and the Trust Business Act underwent drasticrevisions in 2004 and 2006, the first since their enactment. The revisions includedexpanding the ran e of assets that could be entrusted and increasin the numberof entities responsi le for trust business. As a result, the field of trust usiness wid-ened, spurring greater competition.
The prolonged environment of ultra-Iow interest rates such as negative interestrates has also put pressure on ﬁnancial institutions to reform their traditionai busi-ness models.
