Impairment of financial assets (continued)Avai/ab/e-for—sa/e ﬁnancial investments {continued}
In the case of debt instruments classified as available for sale, impairment is assessed based on the same criteria
as financiai assets carried at amortised cost. However, the amount recorded for impairment is the cumulative lossmeasured as the difference between the amortised cost and the current fair value, iess any impairment loss on thatinvestment previously recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Future interest income continues to be accruedbased on the reduced carrying amount of the asset using the rate of interest used to discount the future cash
flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment loss. The interest income is recorded as part of finance income.Impairment losses on debt instruments are reversed through the statement of profit or loss if the subsequent increasein fair vaiue of the instruments can be objectively related to an event occurring after the impairment loss wasrecognised in the statement of profit or ioss.

Financial Iiabili esinitiai recognition and measurement
:inanCial iiabiiities are classified, at initiai recognition, as financiai liabilities at fair vaiue through profit or loss, orcans and borrowings, as appropriate.
Aii financiai liabilities are recognised initiaily at fair value and, in the case of ioans and borrowings, net of directiyattributabie transaction costs.
’he Group's ﬁnancial liabilities inciude trade and other payables, financial liabilities included in other iiabiiities,derivative financial instruments, interest-bearing bank loans, the iiabiiity component of convertible bonds and theiability components of redeemable convertible preferred shares.
Subsequent measurement’he subsequent measurement of financiai iiabilities depends on their ciassification as foliows:Financial liabi/ities at fair value through profit or loss
=inancia| iiabiiities at fair value through profit or ioss include financiai liabilities designated upon initiai recognition asat fair value through profit or loss.

:inancial liabilities designated upon initial recognition as at fair vaiue through profit or loss are designated at the dateof initiai recognition and only if the criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied.
Loans and borrowings
After initiai recognition, interest-bearing bank ioahs are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effectiveinterest rate method unless the effect of discounting wouid be immateriai, in which case they are stated at cost.Gains and iosses are recognised in the statement of profit or ioss when the liabilities are derecognised as weii asthrough the effective interest rate amortisation process.
Amortised cost is calcuiated by taking into account any discount or premium on acquisition and fees or costs that arean integral part of the effective interest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in finance costs in thestatement of profit or loss.

Convertible bonds
The component of convertible bonds that exhibits characteristics of a iiability is recognised as a iiability in thestatement of financiai pOSition, net of transaction costs. On issuance of convertibie bonds, the fair value of theliability component is determined using a market rate for an equivalent non-convertible bond; and this amount
is carried as a long term liability on the amortised cost basis untii extingwshed 0n converSion or redemption. Theremainder of the proceeds is allocated to the conversion option that is recognised and included in shareholders’equity, net of transaction costs. The carrying amount of the conversion option is hot remeasured in subsequent years.Transaction costs are apportioned between the iiability and equity components of the convertibie bonds based on theailocation of proceeds to the iiability and equity components when the instruments are first recognisedv
Derecognition of financial Iiabili

esA financiai iiabiiity is derecognised when the obligation under the liabiiity is discharged or cancelled, or expires.
When an existing financiai iiability is replaced by another from the same lender 0n substantially different terms,
or the terms of an existing iiability are substantiaily modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as aderecognition of the original iiability and a recognition of a new liability, and the difference between the respectivecarrying amounts is recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
offsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and i‘manciai liabilities are offset and the net amount is reported in the statement of finanCial posttionif there is a currently enforceable iegal right to offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on anet basis, or to realise the assets and settie the liabilities stmuitaneousiy.

When the effect of discounting is material, the amount recognised for a prOViSion is the present value at the end ofthe reporting period of the future expenditures expected to be reqwred to settle the obligation. The increase in thediscounted present value amount arising from the passage of time is included in finance costs in the statement ofprofit or loss.
A contingent liability recognised in a busmess combination is initially measured at its fair value. Subsequently, it ismeasured at the higher of (i) the amount that would be recognised in accordance with the general guidance forprov15ions above; and (ii) the amount initially recognised less, when appropriate, cumulative amortisation recognisedin accordance with the guidance for revenue recognition.
Income tax

- in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, assomates and jointventures, deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differenceswill reverse In the foreseeable future and taxable profit Will be available against which the temporarydifferences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to theextent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferredtax asset to be utilised. Uhrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and arerecognised to the extent that it has become probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or partof the deferred tax asset to be recovered.

be received and all attaching conditions will be complied with. When the grant relates to an expense item, it isrecognised as income on a systematic basis over the periods that the costs, which it is intended to compensate, areexpensed.
Where the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is credited to a deferred income account and is released to
the statement of profit or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments ordeducted from the carrying amount of the asset and released to the statement of profit or loss by way of a reduceddepreciation Charge.
Where the Group receives government loans granted With no or at a below-market rate of interest for theconstruction of a qualifying asset, the initial carrying amount of the government loans is determined using theeffective interest rate method, as further explained in the accounting policy for “Financial liabilities above.

(6) Sale of application software
Revenue from the saie of application software is recognised when the significant risks and rewards ofownership have been transferred to the buyer, provided that the Group maintains neither managerialinvolvement to the degree usually associated with ownership, nor effective control over the software sold.
The Group also enters into multi—year licensing arrangements With certain customers to aiiow them to installuniimited copies of the Group’s application software over a period of one to five years for a fixed cashconsideration. During the licence period, the Group is required to provide when-and-if-available upgrades,technicai support and training to the customers. Revenue from multi-year iicensing arrangements is recognisedupon the delivery of the software master copy and the portion in reiation to post-contract customer support isdeferred and amortised over the iicence period.
(b) Services rendered in online games and mobile gamesThe Group engages in development and operation of online games and mobile games.
The Group primarily receives proceeds from sales of either its prepaid game cards to the distributors which
in turn sell the cards to the players, or prepaid online points to the piayers at the Group’s website. Thedistributors coiiect the payment from the piayers and remit the cash net of servtce charges or discounts whichare predetermined according to the reievant terms of the agreements entered into between the Group and thedistributors. Deferred revenue is recognised on the sales of prepaid game cards or prepaid online points net ofthe discounts from the face value of the cards.
The Group operates its mobile games through its own platform or cooperation with third-party gamedistribution piatforms under certain co-operation agreements. For the cooperation with third-party gamedistribution piatforms, the Group is responsibie for providing ongoing updates of new contents and technicalsupport for the operation of the games. The third-party game distribution piatforms are responSibie fordistribution, marketing, platform maintenance and payment collections. The third-party game distributionplatforms collect the payment from players and remit the net proceeds, after deducting the commiSSioncharged, to the Group. In general, the portion of the proceeds received by the Group is caiculated based
on the standard price of in-game virtual currency sold and the agreed sharing ratio in the contracts signedwith third-party game distribution platforms. As some third-party game distribution platforms offer variousmarketing discounts from time to time to piayers to encourage spending, the actual prices paid by piayers maybe iower than the standard prices of in»game virtual currency. Such marketing discount information is neitheravaiiable to be tracked reliably nor borne by the Group, as such, the Group is not abie to make a reasonableestimate of the gross amount received. in this case, the net amount received from these third-party gamedistribution piatforms is recognised as deferred revenue.
The Group recognises revenue from subscription services rendered, saies 0f in-game virtual items to the piayers,and iicensing games and providing technical support to third party publishing partners. Upon expiry of prepaidgame cards or oniine points, any remaining amount is recognised as revenue.

Several online games of the Group are not free to play. The Group applies a pay-to-play subscription-basedmodel, in which the players pay for a pre—specified length of game playing time within a specified period oftime, revenue is recognised based on the actual game playing time by the players and amortised over theperiod,
Sales of in-game virtual items
Some online games and all mobile games of the Group are free to play. Players can purchase game cards oronline pomts and convert them into various in-game virtual items for better in»game experience. Revenue isrecognised only when the services relating to the in-game virtual items purchased are rendered to the players.For the purposes of determining when services have been provided, the Group has applied the following:
0 Consumable items represent in-game virtual items that can be consumed by player actions or expireover a predetermined expiration time. The Group keeps track of the consumption or expiration of all theconsumable items in the game. Revenue in relation to consumable items are recognised (as a releasefrom deterred revenue) after they are consumed or over the period that they are expiring, as the Group’sobligations in connection with such items have been fully rendered to the players after their consumptionor expiration.
- Permanent items represent in-game virtual items that are acceSSible by the players as long as theyplay the game. The Group will provide continuous services in connection with these permanent itemsuntil these items are no longer used by the players. Revenues in relation to the permanent items arerecognised over their estimated useful lives, The Group considers practical usage period, player life or thewhole game life as the Group's best estimate for the appropriate estimated useful lives of the in»gamepermanent items purchased by the players.
The Group estimates the useful lives of the in-game virtual items on a game-by-game basis and re-assessessuch periods semi—ahhually. lt there is insufficient data to determine the useful lives, such as in the case of anewly launched game, it estimates the useful lives based on other games with similar characteristics developedby the Group or by third-party developers until the new game establishes its own patterns and history. If theGroup does not have the ability to differentiate revenue attributable to permanent items from consumableitems for a speciﬁc game, the Group recognises revenue from both permanent and consumable virtual itemsfor that game ratably over the estimated player lives.
Licensing fees
The Group also derives revenue from licensing games to third-party publishing partners, who operate theGroup’s online games in defined regions and/or countries or within a specific period.

Share-based payments
The Group operates several share option schemes and share award schemes for the purpose of providing incentivesand rewards to eligible participants who contribute to the success of the Group’s operations. Employees (includingdirectors) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share-based payments, whereby employees renderservices as consideration for equ1ty instruments (eqUity-settled transactions).
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at whichthey are granted. The fair value is determined by an external vaiuer using a binomial model for share options andbased on the market value for awarded shares. Further details of the fair values of share options and awarded sharesare given in note 38 to the finanCial statements.
The cost of equity-settled transactions is recognised in share-based compensation costs, together with acorresponding increase in equity, over the period in which the performance and/or service conditions are fulfilled.The cumulative expense recognised for equity-settied transactions at the end of each reporting period until thevesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the numberof equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The charge or credit to the statement of profit or loss for a periodrepresents the movement in the cumulative expense recognised as at the beginning and end of that period.
Service and non—market performance conditions are not taken into account when determining the grant date fairvalue of awards, but the likelihood of the conditions being met is assessed as part of the Group’s best estimate ofthe number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Market performance conditions are reflected Within thegrant date fair value. Any other conditions attached to an award, but without an associated service requirement, areconSIdered to be non-vesting conditions. Non~vesting conditions are reflected in the fair value of an award and leadto an immediate expensing of an award unless there are also service and/or performance conditions.
For awards that do not ultimately vest because non-market performance and/or serVice conditions have not beenmet, no expense is recognised, Where awards include a market or non—vesting condition, the transactions aretreated as vesting irrespective of whether the market or non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all otherperformance and/or service conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of an equity—settled award are modified, as a minimum an expense is recognised as if the termshad not been modified, if the original terms of the award are met In addition, an expense is recognised for anymodification that increases the total fair value of the share-based payments, or is otherwise beneficial to theemployee as measured at the date of modification.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and anyexpense not yet recognised for the award is recognised immediately. This includes any award where non-vestingconditions within the control of either the Group or the employee are not met. However, if a new award issubstituted for the cancelled award, and is designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, thecancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification of the original award, as described in theprevious paragraph.
The diiutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of earnings pershare.
Defined contribution plan for PRC employees
FuII-time employees of the Group's subSidiaries which operate in Mainland China are reqUired to partiCipate in
a defined contribution scheme operated by the local municipal government. These subsidiaries are required tocontribute a certain percentage of their payroll costs to the defined contribution scheme which covers pension,medical care, unemployment insurance, employee housing fund and other welfare. The contributions are chargedto the statement of profit or loss as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the defined contributionscheme.

Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, i.e., assetsthat necessariiy take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part ofthe cost of those assets. The capitaiisation of such borrowing costs ceases when the assets are substantially ready fortheir intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowmgs pendingtheir expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs capitalised. Aii other borrowing costs areexpensed in the period in which they are incurred. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entityincurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Foreign currencies
These financial statements are presented in RMB. The functionai currency of the Company is HK$. Each entity in
the Group determines its own functional currency and items inciuded in the finahCiai statements of each entity aremeasured using that functional currency. Foreign currency transactions recorded by the entities in the Group areinitially recorded using their respective functional currency rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions. Monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are transiated at the functional currency rates of exchangeruiing at the end of the reporting period. Differences arising 0n settlement or transiation of monetary items arerecognised in the statement of profit or ioss.
Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using theexchange rates at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreigncurrency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair vaiue was measured. The gain or lossarising on translation of a non»monetary item measured at fair value is treated in line with the recognition of thegain or loss on change in fair value of the item (i.e., translation difference on the item whose fair value gain or iossis recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or ioss is also recognised in other comprehensive income orprofit or ioss, respectively).
The functional currencies of certain overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are currencies other thanRMB. As at the end of the reporting period, the assets and liabiiities of these entities are translated into RMB at

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group’s financiai statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and their accompanyingdisclosures, and the disciosure of contingent liabilities. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates couldresult in outcomes that couid reqwre a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of the assets or iiabiiitiesaffected in the future.
Judgements
In the process of applying the Group's accounting poliCies, management has made the foiiowing judgements,apart from those involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in thefinancial statements:
(a) Accounting for companies governed under contractual arrangements as subsidiaries
The Company and some of its subsidiaries do not hold any equity interests in certain of their subsidiaries.Nevertheless, under the contractual agreements entered into between the Group and the sharehoiders who arethe registered owners of those subsidiaries, the directors of the Company determine that the Group has thepower to govern the financial and operating poiicies of those subsidiaries so as to obtain benefits from theiractivities. As such, those subsidiaries are accounted for as subsidiaries of the Group for accounting purposes.
The Group’s revenue generated from the entities which are controlied by the Group through the contractuaiagreements described above amounted to approximately RMB3,544,022,000 for the year ended 31 December2017. At 31 December 2017, total assets and totai liabilities of these entities amounted to approx1matelyRMB7,100,91S,OOO and RMB4,307,S47,000, respectively.
Estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of thereporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a materiai adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities within the next financial year, are described below.
(a) Fair value of other financial assets
The fair value of the option obtained from an oniine game operator in Vietnam is determined by the Black-Schoies vaiuation model (the “BS Model”). Significant judgement about factors, such as the risk-free rate,dividend yield, expected voiatility and expected life of option, is reqwred to be made by the directors as
the parameters for applying the BS Model, The Company engaged an independent valuer to assess the fairvalue of the option. The fair value of the option was approximately RMBS9,123,000 as at 31 December 2017(2016: RMB38,621,000). Further details are included in note 23 to the financiai statements.
(b) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for unused tax losses to the extent that it is probabie that taxable profitwill be available against which the losses can be utiiised. Significant management judgement is required
to determine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the iikely timing andlevei of future taxable profits together with future tax pianning strategies. The carrying vaiue of deferred taxassets reiating to recognised tax losses at 31 December 2017 was nil (2016: RMBG1,385,000). The amount ofunrecognised tax losses at 31 December 2017 was RMB1,727,052,000 (2016: RMB1,393,680,000). Furtherdetails are included in note 36 to the finanCiai statements.

Impairment of goodwill
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. impairment exists when thecarrying value of a cash-geheratihg unit exceeds its recoverable amounts, which is the higher of its fair valueless costs of disposal and its value in use. The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on themarket price less incremental costs for disposmg of the cash generating units. When value in use calculationsare undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash flows from the cash-generating unit andchoose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying amountof goodWill at 31 December 2017 was appVOXimately RMB9,559,000 (2016: RM8954,656,000). Further detailsare included in note 18 to the financial statements,
Impairment of available-for-sale financial assets
he Group classifies certain assets as available for sale and recognises movements of their fair values in equity.When the fair value declines, management makes assumptions about the decline in value to determinewhether there is an impairment that should be recognised in the statement of profit or loss. During the yearended 31 December 2017, impairment losses of RMB168,712,000 have been recognised for available-for-saleinvestments (2016: RMB1,109,544,000(restated)), The carrying amount of available-for—sale investments wasRMB1,357,216,000 (2016: RMB1,255,503,000) as at 31 December 2017. Further details are included in note22 to the financial statements.
Impairment of non-financial assets (other than goodwill)
he Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for all non-finahcial assets at the end ofeach reporting period. Indefinite life intangible assets are tested for impairment annually and at other timeswhen such an indicator eXists. Other non-finanCial assets are tested for impairment when there are indicatorshat the carrying amounts may not be recoverable An impairment exists when the carrying value of an assetor a cash—generating unit exceeds its recoverable amounts, which is the higher of its fair value less costs ofdisposal and its value in use. The calculation of the fair value less costs of disposal is based on available datarom binding sales transactions in an arm’s length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices lessincremental costs for disposing of the asset. When value in use calculations are undertaken, management mustestimate the expected future cash flows from the asset or cash-generatihg unit and choose a suitable discountrate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows.

Impairment of trade receivables, other debtors and amounts due from related parties
The Group maintains an allowance for the estimated loss arising from the inability of its customers, otherdebtors and related parties to make the required payments. The Group makes its estimates based on the ageingof these balances, creditworthiness, business operation and historical write-off experience. If the financialcondition of its customers, other debtors and related parties was to deteriorate so that the actual impairmentloss might be higher than expected, the Group would be reqwred to revise the basis of making the allowance.
Useful lives of virtual items provided in the Group's online games and mobile games
The players purchase in-game virtual items provided in the Group’s online games and mobile games, whichinclude items consumed at a single point in time, over a pre-specified period or throughout the whole gamelife. Revenue is recognised over their estimated useful lives, which are determined on the basis of the Group’sbest estimate that takes into account all known, available and relevant information at the time of assessment.The Group estimates the useful lives of the in-game virtual items on a game-by-game basis and re-assessessuch periods semi-annually. Future usage patterns may differ from the historical usage patterns on which therevenue recognition of the Virtual item is based. The Group monitors the operating strategy and businesspatterns of the virtual item. Any adjustments arising from changes in the useful lives as a result of updatedinformation will be accounted for prospectively as a change in accounting estimate.

DEFERRED TAX (continued)
Pursuant to the PRC Corporate Income Tax Law, a 10% withholding tax is ieVied 0n dividends deciared to foreigninvestors from the foreign investment enterprises estabiished in Mainland China. The requirement iS effective from1 January 2008 and appiies to earnings after 31 December 2007. A lower withholding tax rate may be applied
if there is a tax treaty between Mainland China and the jurisdiction of the foreign investors. For the Group, theapplicable rate is 5% or 10%. The Group is therefore liable for withholding taxes on dividends distributed by thosesubsidiaries established in Mainland China in respect of earnings generated from 1 January 2008.
A deferred tax liability is recognised for the estimated withholding taxes to the extent that it is probable that
those subSidiaries Wiii distribute earnings in the foreseeable future. This requires an estimation of the iikely timingand levei of dividends to be distributed, and a judgement as to whether the dividends are associated to earningsgenerated from 1 January 2008 or not. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated With investmentsin subsidiaries in Mainiand China, for which deferred tax iiabilities have not been recognised for withholding taxesthat wouid be payable on the unremitted earnings of these subsidiaries, totalled approximateiy RMB4,911 million
at 31 December 2017 (2016: RMB4,064 million). In the opinion of the directors, it is not probable that thesesubsidiaries will distribute such earnings in the foreseeable future.
There are no income tax consequences attaching to the payment of divtdends by the Company to its sharehoiders,

FAIR VALUE AND FAIR VALUE HIERARCHY OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (continued)
Management has assessed that the fair values of cash and bank deposits, pledged deposit, trade receivables, tradepayables, financial assets inciuded in prepayments, deposits and other receivables and financral iiabilities included inother payables approximate to their carrying amounts iargely due to the short term maturities of these instruments.
The Group’s ﬁnance department headed by the ﬁnance manager is responsibie for determining the policies andprocedures for the fair value measurement of financial instruments. The finance manager reports directly to thechief financiai officer (“CFO) and the audit committee. At each reporting date, the finance department analysesthe movements in the values of financial instruments and determines the mayor inputs applied in the valuation. Thevaluation is reviewed and approved by the CFO and the valuation process and results are discussed with the auditcommittee.
The fair values of the financiai assets and liabilities are included at the amount at which the instrument could beexchanged in a current transaction between Wiiling parties, other than in a forced or liquidation sale. The foiiowingmethods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair values:
The fair values of loan receivables and interest-bearing bank borrowings have been calcuiated by discounting
the expected future cash flows usrng rates currently avaiiable for instruments With Similar terms, credit risk andremaining maturities. The Group’s own non-pertormance risk for interest—bearing bank ioans as at 31 December2017 was assessed to be insignificant. The fair values of the liability portion of the convertible bonds and the liabilitycomponent of the redeemabie convertibie preferred shares are estimated by discounting the expected future cashflows usrng an equivalent market interest rate for a simiiar convertible bond with consideration of the Group’s ownnon-performance risk.
The fair values of listed equity investments are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of unlisted available—for—sale equity investments have been estimated using a discounted cash ﬂow valuation model based on assumptionsthat are not supported by observabie market prices or rates. The valuation requires the directors to make estimatesabout the expected future cash flows including expected future divrdends and proceeds on subsequent disposal
of the shares. The directors believe that the estimated fair values resuiting from the valuation technique, which
are recorded in the consolidated statement of financiai position, and the related changes in fair vaiues, which arerecorded in other comprehensive income, are reasonable, and that they were the most appropriate values at the endof the reporting period.
The fair value of other ﬁnancial asset has been estimated using the Black Schoies Model. The valuation techniqueis based on assumptions that are not supported by observable market prices or rates. The valuation requires thedirectors to make estimates about life of option, expected voiatility, underiying equity value and discount rates.The directors believe that the estimated fair values resuiting from the valuation technique, which are recorded inthe consolidated statement of financiai position, and the related changes in fair vaiues, which are recorded in theconsoiidated statement of profit or loss, are reasonable, and that they were the most appropriate values at the endof the reporting period.
The fair values of other iiabiiities have been estimated using a discounted cash flow valuation model based onassumptions that are not supported by observabie market prices or rates. The valuation requires the directors
to make estimates about the expected future cash flows including expected future dividends and proceeds onsubsequent disposal of the shares. The directors believe that the estimated fair values resulting from the vaiuationtechnique, which are recorded in the consoiidated statement of financral posrtion, and the related changes in fairvalues, which are recorded in other comprehensive income, are reasonable, and that they were the most appropriatevalues at the end of the reporting period.

RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE DIRECTORS FOR THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The directors of the Company are responsible for the preparation of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements that give a trueand fair view in accordance with IFRSs issued by the iASB and the disciosure requirements of the Hong Kong CompaniesOrdinance, and for such internal control as the directors determine iS necessary to enable the preparation of consolidatedﬁnancial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
in preparing the consolidated financial statements, the directors of the Company are responsible for assessing theGroup’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using thegoing concern basis of accounting unless the directors of the Company either intend to liquidate the Group or to ceaseoperations or have no realistic aiternative but to do so.
The directors of the Company are assisted by the Audit Committee in discharging their responsibilities for overseeing theGroup’s financial reporting process.
AUDITOR'S RESPONSIBILITIES FOR THE AUDIT OF THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated tinanCial statements as a whole arefree from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that inciudes our opinion.Our report is made solely to you, as a body, and for no other purpose. We do not assume responsibility towards or acceptiiabiiity to any other person for the contents of this report.
Reasonable assurance is a high ievel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance withHKSAs will always detect a materiai misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and areconsidered material if, indiVidually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with HKSAs, we exercise professionai judgement and maintain professional skepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consoiidated financiai statements, whether due to fraudor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficientand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting fromfraud is higher than for one resuiting from error, as fraud may invoive collusion, forgery, intentional omiSSions,misrepresentations, or the override of internal controi.
0 Obtain an understanding of internai controi relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theGroup’s internal controi.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonabieness of accounting estimates and reiateddisclosures made by the directors.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based onthe audit evidence obtained, whether a materiai uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may castsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a materiai uncertaintyexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disciosures in the consoiidated financiaistatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conciusions are based on the auditevidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Groupto cease to continue as a gomg concern.
0 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated finanCial statements, including thedisclosures, and whether the consoiidated financiai statements represent the underlying transactions and events in amanner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activitieswithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsibie for thedirection, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain soleiy responsible for our audit opinions

2.1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance With International Financial Reporting Standards(”IFRSs”) (which include all International FinanCial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards (”IASs)and Interpretations) issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”) and the disclosure requirementsof the Hong Kong Companies Ordinance. They have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except foravailable-for—sale investments, other financial assets, contingent consideration and derivative financial instruments,which have been measured at fair value. These finanCial statements are presented in Renminbi (“RMB”) and allvalues are rounded to the nearest thousand except when otherWise indicated.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the finanCial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries for
the year ended 31 December 2017. A subSidiary is an entity (including a structured entity), directly or indirectly,controlled by the Company. Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns fromits involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee(i.e., existing rights that give the Group the current ability to direct the relevant activities of the investee).
When the Company has, directly or indirectly, less than a majority of the voting or similar rights of an investee, theGroup considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
(a) the contractual arrangement with the other vote holders of the investee;(b) rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and(c) the Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights.
The financial statements of the subSidiaries are prepared for the same reporting period as the Company, usingconsistent accounting policies, The results of subsidiaries are consolidated from the date on which the Group obtainscontrol, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of the parent ofthe Group and to the non-controlling interests, even if this results in the non-controllrng interests having a defiCitbalance. All intra-group assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactionsbetween members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
The Group reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that there are changesto one or more of the three elements of control described above. A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary,without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction.
If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises (i) the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of thesubsidiary, (ii) the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest and (iii) the cumulative translation differencesrecorded in equity; and recognises (i) the fair value of the consideration received, (ii) the fair value of any investmentretained and (iii) any resulting surplus or defiCIt in profit or loss. The Group's share of components preyiouslyrecognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified to profit or loss or retained profits, as appropriate, on thesame basis as would be required it the Group had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
The Company and certain subsidiaries have set up trusts or entities for the purpose of purchasing, administeringand holding their shares for the share award scheme adopted. The Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial andoperating policies of these trust or entities and derive benefits from the services of the employees who have beenawarded the shares through their continued employment with the Group. The assets and liabilities of these trustentities are included in consolidated statement of financial position,

ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (continued)
Further information about those IFRSs that are expected to be applicable to the Group is described below. Of thosestandards, IFRS 9 and lFRS 15 will be applicable for the Group’s ﬁnancial year ending 31 December 2018 and areexpected to have a significant impact upon adoption. Whilst management has performed a detailed assessment ofthe estimated impacts of these standards, that assessment IS based on the information currently available to theGroup, including expectations of the application of transitional provision options and policy choices. The actualimpacts upon adoption could be different to those below, depending on additional reasonable and supportableinformation being made available to the Group at the time of applying the standards and the transitional provisionsand policy options finally adopted.
The lASB issued amendments to lFRS 2 in June 2016 that address three main areas: the effects of vesting conditionson the measurement of a cash-settled share-based payment transaction; the classification of a share-based paymenttransaction with net settlement features for withholding a certain amount in order to meet an employee’s taxobligation associated with the share-based payment; and accounting where a modification to the terms andconditions of a share-based payment transaction changes its classification from cash-settled to equity—settled.
The amendments Clarify that the approach used to account for vesting conditions when measuring equity-settledshare—based payments also applies to cash-settled share-based payments, The amendments introduce an exceptionso that a share-based payment transaction with net share settlement features for withholding a certain amount
in order to meet the employee’s tax obligation is classn‘ied In its entirety as an equity-settled share-based paymenttransaction when certain conditions are met. Furthermore, the amendments clarify that it the terms and conditionsof a cash-settled share-based payment transaction are modified, with the result that it becomes an equity-settledshare—based payment transaction, the transaction is accounted for as an equity-settled transaction from the date ofthe modification. On adoption, entities are reqwred to apply the amendments Without restating prior periods, butretrospective application is permitted if they elect to adopt for all three amendments and other criteria are met. TheGroup will adopt the amendments from 1 January 2018. The amendments are not expected to have any significantimpact on the Group’s financial statements.
In July 2014, the IASB issued the final version of IFRS 9, bringing together all phases of the ﬁnancial instrumentsproject to replace lAS 39 and all preVious versions of IFRS 9. The standard introduces new requirements forclassn‘ication and measurement, impairment and hedge accounting. The Group will adopt IFRS 9 from 1 January2018. The Group will not restate comparative information and will recognise any transition adjustments againstthe opening balance of equity at 1 January 2018. During 2017, the Group has performed a detailed assessment ofthe impact of the adoption of IFRS 9. The expected impacts relate to the classification and measurement and theimpairment requirements and are summarised as follows:
(a) Classification and measurement
The Group does not expect that the adoption of IFRS 9 will have a significant impact on the classification andmeasurement of its financial assets. It expects to continue measuring at fair value all finariCial assets currentlyheld at fair value. Material equity investments currently held as available for sale will be measured at fair valuethrough other comprehensive income as the investments are intended to be held for the foreseeable future andthe Group expects to apply the option to present fair value changes in other comprehensive income. Gains andlosses recorded in other comprehenSive income for the equity investments cannot be recycled to profit or losswhen the investments are derecognised.
(b) Impairment
IFRS 9 requires an impairment on debt instruments recorded at amortised cost or at fair value through othercomprehensive income, lease receivables, loan commitments and financial guarantee contracts that are notaccounted for at fair value through profit or loss under lFRS 9, to be recorded based on an expected creditloss model either on a twelve-month basis or a lifetime basis. The Group will apply the simplified approachand record lifetime expected losses that are estimated based on the present values of all cash shortfalls overthe remaining life of all of its trade receivables, Furthermore, the Group will apply the general approach andrecord twelve-month expected credit losses that are estimated based on the possible default events on its otherreceivables within the next twelve months. The Group does not expect that the adoption of IFRS 9 will have asignificant impact on the impairment of trade and other receivables.

ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL REPORTING STANDARDS (continued)
Amendments to IFRS 10 and IAS 28 address an inconsistency between the requirements in IFRS 10 and in IAS 28
in dealing with the sale or contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture. Theamendments require a full recognition of a gain or loss when the sale or contribution of assets between an investorand its associate or joint venture constitutes a business. For a transaction involving assets that do not constitute abusiness, a gain or loss resulting from the transaction is recognised in he investor's profit or loss only to the extentof the unrelated investor’s interest in that associate or joint venture. The amendments are to be applied prospectively.The preyious mandatory effective date of amendments to IFRS 10 and AS 28 was removed by the IASB in December2015 and a new mandatory effective date will be determined after the completion of a broader review of accountingfor associates and joint ventures. However, the amendments are available for adoption now.
IFRS 15, issued in May 2014, establishes a new five-step model to account for revenue arising from contracts withcustomers. Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that ref ects the consideration to which an entityexpects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. The principles in IFRS 15 prowde amore structured approach for measuring and recognising revenue. The standard also introduces extensive qualitativeand quantitative disclosure requirements, including disaggregation of total revenue, information about performanceobligations, changes in contract asset and liability account balances be ween periods and keyjudgements andestimates. The standard will supersede all current revenue recognition requirements under lFRSs. Either a fullretrospective application or a modified retrospective adoption is requ1red on the initial application of the standard. InApril 2016, the IASB issued amendments to IFRS 15 to address the imp ementation issues on identifying performanceobligations, application guidance on principal versus agent and licences of intellectual property, and transition.
The amendments are also intended to help ensure a more consistent aoplication when entities adopt IFRS 15 anddecrease the cost and complexity of applying the standard. The Group plans to adopt the transitional provisions inIFRS 15 to recognise the cumulative effect of initial adoption as an adjustment to the opening balance of retainedearnings at 1 January 2018. In addition, the Group plans to apply the new requirements only to contracts that arenot completed before 1 January 2018. The Group expects that the transitional adjustment to be made on 1 January2018 upon initial adoption of IFRS 15 Will not be material and changes in accounting policies, as further explainedbelow, will have no material impact on the Group’s financial statements from 2018 onwards. During 2017, theGroup has performed a detailed assessment on the impact of the adoption of IFRS 15.

The Group’s principal actiVities mainly consist of prowsion of serVices rendered in online games and mobile games,proviSion of cloud services and sale of application software, The expected impacts arising from the adoption of IFRS15 on the Group are summarised as follows:
(a) Provision of services rendered in online games and mobile games
The Group recognises revenue from subscription services rendered, sales of in-game virtual items to the playersand licensing games and providing technical support to third party publishing partners. Upon the adoption
of lFRS 15, revenue Will be recognised at the pomt in time when control of the asset is transferred to thecustomer, generally on delivery of the goods, or over time the customers simultaneously receive and consumethe benefits provided by the Group, generally over the period that the sewices are provided. The Group expectsthat there will be no material impact of the adoption of IFRS 15 based on the current contracts terms.
([1) Provision of cloud services
The Group provides cloud storage and cloud computation serVices. Currently, revenue from provision of cloudservices is recognised when the services are provided, which will remain substantially unchanged upon theadoption of IFRS 15, as the Group’s contract With customers generally has one performance obligation, whichwill be fulfilled when the sewices are provided.

(c) Sale of application software
The Group sells application software and provides services associated with the software, which will beidentified as two distinct performance obligations under IFRS 15. Currently, revenue from sale of applicationsoftware is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership are transferred to the buyer andrevenue from prowsion of sewices associated with the software is recognised over the period that the servicesare provided. For certain multi-year commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct softwarelicenses and software assurance, the Group will recognise license revenue at the time of contract executionrather than over the subscription period, Due to the complexity of the contracts, the actual revenue recognitiontreatment required under IFRS 15 Will depend on contract-specific terms. The Group has determined that whenIFRS 15 is adopted, there would be no impact on the revenue recognition from the sale of the applicationsoftware based on the current contracts terms.
(d) Presentation and disclosure
The presentation and disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 are more detailed than those under the current IAS18. The presentation requirements represent a significant change from current practice and will significantlyincrease the volume of disclosures required in the Group’s financial statements, Many of the disclosurerequirements in IFRS 15 are new and the Group has assessed that the impact of some of these disclosurerequirements will be significant. In particular, the Group expects that the notes to the ﬁnancial statementswill be expanded because of the disclosure of significant judgements made on determining the transactionprices of those contracts that include variable consideration, how the transaction prices have been allocatedto the performance obligations, and the assumptions made to estimate the stand—alone selling price of eachperformance obligation. In addition, as required by IFRS 15, the Group will disaggregate revenue recognisedfrom contracts with customers into categories that depict how the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty ofrevenue and cash flows are affected by economic factors. It will also disclose information about the relationshipbetween the disclosure of disaggregated revenue and revenue information disclosed for each reportablesegment.
IFRS 16, issued in January 2016, replaces IAS 17 Leases, IFRIC 4 Determining Whether an Arrangement contains aLease, SIC 15 Operating Leases — Incentives and SIC 27 Evaluating the Substance of Transactions Invo/ving the LegalForm ofa Lease. The standard sets out the principles for the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosureof leases and requires lessees to recognise assets and liabilities for most leases. The standard includes two electiverecognition exemptions for lessees — leases of low-value assets and short-term leases. At the commencement dateof a lease, a lessee Will recognise a liability to make lease payments (i.e., the lease liability) and an asset representingthe right to use the underlying asset during the lease term (i.e., the right-of-use asset). The right-of-use asset issubsequently measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any impairment losses unless the right-of-useasset meets the definition of investment property in IAS 40, or relates to a class of property, plant and equipment towhich the revaluation model is applied. The lease liability is subsequently increased to reflect the interest on the leaseiability and reduced for the lease payments. Lessees will be required to separately recognise the interest expense onthe lease liability and the depreciation expense on the right-of-use asset. Lessees will also be required to remeasurehe lease liability upon the occurrence of certain events, such as change in the lease term and change in future
ease payments resulting from a change in an index or rate used to determine those payments. Lessees will generallyrecognise the amount of the remeasurement of the lease liability as an adjustment to the right-of-use asset. Lessoraccounting under IFRS 16 is substantially unchanged from the accounting under IAS 17. Lessors Will continue to classtfyall leases using the same classification principle as in IAS 17 and distinguish between operating leases and finance leases.FRS 16 requires lessees and lessors to make more extensive disclosures than under IAS 17. Lessees can choose to applythe standard using either a full retrospective or a modified retrospective approach. The Group expects to adopt IFRS 16rom 1 January 2019. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 16 upon adoption and is considering whetherit will choose to take advantage of the practical expedients available and which transmon approach and reliefs Will beadopted. As disclosed in note 44 to the financial statements, at 31 December 2017, the Group had future minimumease payments under non-cancellable operating leases in aggregate of approximately RMBBS8,795,000. Upon adoptionof IFRS 16, certain amounts included therein may need to be recognised as new right—of—use assets and lease liabilities,:urther analySis, however, Will be needed to determine the amount of new rights of use assets and lease liabilities to berecognised, including, but not limited to, any amounts relating to leases of Iow-value assets and short-term leases, otherractical expedients and reliefs chosen, and new leases entered into before the date of adoption.

Amendments to IAS 28 issued in October 2017 clanfy that the scope exclusion of IFRS 9 only includes interests inan associate orjoint venture to whlch the equity method is applied and does not include long-term interests thatin substance form part of the net investment in the associate or Jomt venture, to which the equity method has notbeen applied, Therefore, an entity applies IFRS 9, rather than IAS 28, includlng the impalrment requirements underIFRS 9, in accounting for such Iong-term lnterests. IAS 28 is then applied to the net lnvestment, which includes theIong-term lnterests, only ln the context of recognising losses of an associate or joint venture and impalrment of thenet investment in the associate or jolnt venture. The Group expects to adopt the amendments 0n 1 January 2019and will assess its business model for such long-term interests based on the facts and Clrcumstances that exist on
1 January 2019 uslng the transitional requirements in the amendments. The Group also lntends to apply the relieffrom restating comparative information for prior penods upon adoption of the amendments.
Amendments to IAS 40, issued in December 2016, clarify when an entity should transfer property, lncludlng propertyunder construction or development, lMO or out of investment property. The amendments state that a change m useoccurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the definition of lnvestment property and there is evidence ofthe change in use. A mere change in management’s intentions for the use of a property does not provtde evidenceof a change in use, The amendments should be applied prospectively to the changes in use that occur on or after theaeginning 0f the annual reporting period in which the entity ﬁrst applles the amendments. An entity should reassessthe classificatlon of property held at the date that it ﬁrst applles the amendments and, if appllcable, reclassifyoroperty to reflect the condltions that exist at that date. Retrospective application is only permitted if it is possiblewithout the use of hindsight. The Group expects to adopt the amendments prospectlvely from 1 January 2018.
'he amendments are not expected to have any Slgnlficant impact on the Group’s ﬁnancial statements,
FRIC 22, issued In December 2016, provides guidance on how to determine the date of the transactlon whenapplying IAS 21 to the situation where an entity receives or pays advance conslderation ln a forelgn currency andrecognises a non-monetary asset or liability. The lnterpretation Clarn‘ies that the date of the transaction for theourpose of determining the exchange rate to use on lnltial recognition of the related asset, expense or lncome
(or part of it) ls the date on which an entity initially recognises the non-monetary asset (such as a prepayment) ornon-monetary|lab1llty(such as deferred income) ansing from the payment or receipt of the advance constderation.
f there are multiple payments or receipts in advance of recognising the related ltem, the entity must determine thetransaction date for each payment or receipt of the advance consideration. Entities may apply the lnterpretation on aull retrospective basis or on a prospective basis, elther from the beginning of the reporting penod in whlch the entityirst applles the interpretation or the beginning of the prior reporting period presented as comparative informatlonin the financlal statements of the reporting penod m which the entity first applies the interpretation. The Groupexpects to adopt the lnterpretation prospectively from 1 January 2018. The lnterpretation are not expected to haveany signiﬁcant impact on the Group's financtal statements.
FRIC 23, issued in June 2017, addresses the accounting for income taxes (current and deferred) when taxtreatments involve uncertalnty that affects the appllcatlon 0f lAS 12 (often referred to as “uncertaln tax positlons).'he interpretation does not apply to taxes or leVles outside the scope of lAS 12, nor does it specifically includerequirements relating to lnterest and penalties assoclated with uncertain tax treatments. The lnterpretatlonspecifically addresses (l) whether an entity considers uncertain tax treatments separately; (ii) the assumptlons anentity makes about the examination of tax treatments by taxation authorltles; (iii) how an entity determines taxablearofits or tax losses, ta>< bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates; and (iv) how an entlty considerschanges in facts and circumstances, The interpretation is to be applled retrospectlvely, either fully retrospectlvelywithout the use of hindsight 0r retrospectlvely with the cumulatlve effect of appllcation as an adjustment to theopening equity at the date of Initlal application, without the restatement of comparative informatlon. The Groupexpects to adopt the lnterpretation from 1 January 2019. The interpretation are not expected to have any slgnlficantimpact on the Group’s financtal statements.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Investments in associates and joint ventures
An associate is an entity in which the Group has a iong term interest of generally not less than 20% 0f the equityvoting rights and over which it is m a position to exercise significant inﬂuence. Significant influence IS the power tooarticipate in the financiai and operating policy decisions of the investee, but is not control or joint control over thoseaolicies.
A joint venture is a type of joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement1ave rights to the net assets of the joint venture. Joint controi is the contractuaiiy agreed sharing of controi of anarrangement, which exists oniy when decisions about the relevant activities require the unanimous consent of theaarties sharing control.
'he Group’s investments in associates and Joint ventures are stated in the consolidated statement of finanCial positionat the Group’s share of net assets under the equity method of accounting, less any impairment losses.
Adjustments are made to bring into iine any dissimiiar accounting policies that exist.
’he Group's share of the post-acquiSition results and other comprehensive income of associates and joint ventures isincluded in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and consolidated other comprehensive income, respectively.n addition, when there has been a change recognised directiy in the equity of the associate or joint venture, theGroup recognises its share of any changes, when appiicable, in the consoiidated statement of changes in equity.Unrealised gains and iosses resulting from transactions between the Group and its associates orjoint ventures areeiiminated to the extent of the Group's investments in the associates or joint ventures, except where unrealised lossesorovide evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of associates or'oint ventures i5 inciuded as part of the Group’s investments in associates orpint ventures.

When an investment in an associate or a joint venture is classiﬁed as held for sale, it is accounted for in accordancewith IFRS S Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations.
Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acqwsition method, The consideration transferred is measured atthe acquisition date fair vaiue which is the sum of the acquisition date fair values of assets transferred by the Group,liabilities assumed by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree and the eqUity interests issued by the Group inexchange for controi ot the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measure the non-controlling interests in the acquiree that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionateshare of net assets in the event of liquidation at fair vaiue or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiablenet assets. All other components of non-controlling interests are measured at fair value. Acquisition-related costs areexpensed as incurred.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed for appropriateclassification and designation in accordance with the contractuai terms, economic circumstances and pertinentconditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contracts of theacquiree.
If the business combination is achieved in stages, the previousiy heid equity interest is remeasured at its acquisitiondate fair vaiue and any resulting gain or ioss Is recognised In profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.Contingent consideration ciassified as an asset or liability is measured at fair value with changes in fair vaiuerecognised in profit or ioss. Contingent consideration that is classified as equity is not remeasured and subsequentsettlement is accounted for wtthin eqwty.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)Business combinations and goodwill (continued)
Goodwiii is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the aggregate of the consideration transferred, the amountrecognised for non—controlling interests and any fair vaiue of the Group’s previousiy held equity interests in theacquiree over the identifiable net assets acquired and liabilities assumed. it the sum of this consideration and otheritems iS lower than the fair value of the net assets acquired, the difference is, after reassessment, recognised in profitor ioss as a gain on bargain purchase.
After initiai recognition, goodwili is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment tosses. Goodwill is testedfor impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the cam/ing vaiuemay be impaired. The Group performs its annual impairment test of goodWiil as at 31 December. For the purposeof impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to eachof the Group's cash-generating units, or groups of cash-generating units, that are expected to benefit from thesynergies of the combination, irrespective of whether other assets or iiabilities of the Group are assigned to thoseunits or groups of units.
Impairment is determined by assessmg the recoverabie amount of the cash-generating unit (group of cash—generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Where the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (groupof cash-generating units) is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised. An impairment iossrecognised for goodwiil is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Where goodWiil has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generating units) and part of theoperation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwili associated with the operation disposed of is included in thecarrying amount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on the disposal. Goodwill disposed of in thesecircumstances is measured based on the relative value of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Fair value measurement
The Group measures its avaiiable—for—saie investments, other financial assets, contingent consideration andderivative financial instruments at fair value at the end of each reporting period. Fair vaiue is the price that wouldbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderiy transaction between market participants atthe measurement date. The fair vaiue measurement is based on the presumption that the transaction to sell theasset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principal market for the asset or liability, or in the absence of aprincipal market, in the most advantageous market for the asset or iiability, The principal or the most advantageousmarket must be accessibie by the Group. The fair value of an asset or a liabiiity is measured using the assumptionsthat market participants wouid use when pricing the asset or iiabiiity, assuming that market partiCipants act in theireconomic best interest.
A fair value measurement of a non-finanCial asset takes into account a market participants ability to generateeconomic benefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant thatwould use the asset in its highest and best use.
The Group uses valuation techniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufficient dataare available to measure fair value, maXimising the use of relevant observable inputs and minimising the use ofunobservable inputs.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Fair value measurement (continued)
Ail assets and iiabilities for which fair value is measured or disclosed in the finanCial statements are categorised Withinthe fair value hierarchy, described as foliows, based on the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement as a whole:
Level 1 — based on quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or iiabiiities
Level 2 7 based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is Significant to the fair valuemeasurement is observable, either directly or indirectly
Level 3 — based on valuation techniques for which the lowest level input that is significant to the fair valuemeasurement is unobservable
For assets and liabilities that are recognised in the financial statements on a recurring basis, the Group determineswhether transfers have occurred between levels in the hierarchy by reassessmg categorisation (based on the lowestlevel input that is significant to the fair value measurement as a whole) at the end of each reporting period.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Where an indication of impairment exists, or when annuai impairment testing for an asset is required (other thaninventories and financial assets), the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An asset’s recoverable amount is thehigher of the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s value in use and its fair value iess costs of disposal, and is determinedfor an individuai asset, uniess the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those fromother assets or groups of assets, in which case the recoverabie amount is determined for the cash-generating unit towhich the asset belongs.
An impairment loss is recognised oniy if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverabie amount. In assessingvalue in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate thatreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speCific to the asset. An impairment iossis charged to the statement of proﬁt or loss in the period in which it arises in those expense categories consistentwith the function of the impaired asset.
An assessment is made at the end of each reporting period as to whether there is an indication that previouslyrecognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased. If such an indication exists, the recoverableamount is estimated. A previously recognised impairment loss of an asset other than goodWiil is reversed only if therehas been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount of that asset, but not to an amounthigher than the carrying amount that wouid have been determined (net of any depreciation/amortisation) had noimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversai of such an impairment loss is credited to thestatement of profit or loss in the period in which it arises, unless the asset is carried at a revaiued amount, in whichcase the reversal of the impairment loss is accounted for in accordance with the relevant accounting policy for thatrevalued asset.

Property. plant and equipment and depreciation
Property, plant and eqUipment, other than construction in progress, are stated at cost less accumulated depreciationand any impairment losses. The cost of an item of property, piant and equipment comprises its purchase price andany directly attributable costs of bringing the asset to its working condition and location for its intended use.
Expenditure incurred after items of property, plant and equipment have been put into operation, such as repairs andmaintenance, is normally charged to the statement of profit or ioss in the period in which it is incurred. in situationswhere the recognition criteria are satisfied, the expenditure for a major inspection is capitalised in the carryingamount of the asset as a repiacement. Where significant parts of property, piant and equipment are required to bereplaced at intervals, the Group recognises such parts as individual assets with speCific usefui lives and depreCiatesthem accordingly.

Property. plant and equipment and depreciation (continued)
Depreciation is calculated on the straight-Iine basis to write off the cost of each item of property, plant andequipment to its residual value over its estimated usefui iife. The principal annuai rates used for this purpose are asfoilows:
Leasehoid iand and buildings Over the shorter 0f the iease terms and 50 years
Eiectrohic equment 33%
Office equmeht and fixtures 19%
Motor vehicles 24%
Leasehoid improvements Over the shorter of the expected life of the leasehold improvements and
the iease terms
Where parts of an item of property, plant and eqUipment have different useful iives, the cost of that item is allocatedon a reasonabie basis among the parts and each part is depreciated separateiy. Residual values, useful lives and thedepreciation method are reViewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at least at each financiai year end.
An item of property, piant and equipment including any significant part initiaiiy recognised is derecognised upondisposal or when no future economic benefits are expected from its use or disposai. Any gain or loss on disposalor retirement recognised in the statement of profit or ioss in the year the asset is derecognised is the difference

Construction in progress represents a building under construction, which is stated at cost iess any impairmentlosses and is not depreciated. Cost comprises the direct costs of construction during the period of construction.Construction in progress is reclassified to the appropriate category of property, plant and equipment whencompleted and ready for use.
Intangible assets (other than goodwill)
Intangibie assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assetsacquired in a business combination is the fair vaiue at the date of acquisition. The useful lives of intangible assets areassessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangibie assets with finite lives are subsequently amortised over the usefuleconomic We and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired.The amortisation period and the amortisation method for an intangibie asset with a finite usefui iife are reviewed atleast at each finanCiai year end.
Intangibie assets with indefinite usefui lives are tested for impairment annuaiiy either individuaiiy or at the cash»generating unit ievei. Such intangibie assets are hot amortised. The useful life of an intangibie asset with anindefinite life is reviewed annually to determine whether the indefinite iife assessment continues to be supportable.If not, the change in the useful life assessment from indefinite to finite iS accounted for on a prospective baSis.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)Intangible assets (other than goodwill) (continued)Purchased software, user base and licence rights for games
Purchased software, user base and licence rights for games are stated at cost less any impairment losses and areamortised on the straight-line baSis over the shorter of the estimated economic lives and the licence period. Theestimation useful lives are as follows:
Purchased software 1—10 yearsUser base 1-6 yearsLicence rights for games 1—5 years
Research and deve/opment costsAll research costs are charged to the statement of profit or loss as incurred.
Expenditure incurred on projects to develop new products IS capitalised and deferred only when the Group candemonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available for use or sale, itsintention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits,the availability of resources to complete the proiect and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during thedevelopment. Product development expenditure which does not meet these criteria is expensed when incurred.
Website and internally used software development costs
The Group expenses all development costs of webSite and internally used software that are incurred in connectionwith the planning and implementation phases of development and costs that are associated with repairs ormaintenance of the existing websites and software. Costs incurred in the development phase that satisﬁed thecriteria for development cost capitalisation listed above are capitalised and amortised over the estimated product livesof the underlying products not exceeding one to two years, commencing from the dates when the products are putinto commercial production.
Leases
Leases that transfer substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets to the Group, other than legal title,are accounted for as ﬁnance leases. At the inception of a finance lease, the cost of the leased asset is capitalised atthe present value of the minimum lease payments and recorded together with the obligation, excluding the interestelement, to reflect the purchase and financing. Assets held under capitalised finance leases, including prepaid landlease payments under finance leases, are included in property, plant and equipment, and depreciated over the shorterof the lease terms and the estimated useful lives of the assets, The finance costs of such leases are charged to thestatement of profit or loss so as to prowde a constant periodic rate of charge over the lease terms.
Assets acquired through hire purchase contracts of a financing nature are accounted for as finance leases, but aredepreciated over their estimated useful lives.
Leases where substantially all the rewards and risks of ownership of assets remain with the lessor are accounted foras operating leases. Where the Group is the lessor, assets leased by the Group under operating leases are included innon-current assets, and rentals receivable under the operating leases are credited to the statement of profit or losson the straight-Iine basis over the lease terms. Where the Group is the lessee, rentals payable under operating leasesnet of any incentives received from the lessor are charged to the statement of profit or loss on the straight-line baSisover the lease terms.

Leases (continued)
Prepaid land lease payments under operating leases are initially stated at cost and subsequently recognised on thestraight-line basis over the lease terms. When the lease payments cannot be aliocated reiiabiy between the iand andbuildings elements, the entire lease payments are included in the cost of the land and buiidings as a finance lease inproperty, plant and equipment.
Investments and other financial assetsInitial recognition and measurement
FinanCial assets are ciasSified, at initial recognition, as financtal assets at fair vaiue through profit or loss, loans andreceivables and avaiiabIe-for-sale financial investments, as appropriate. When financial assets are recognised initially,they are measured at fair vaiue pius transaction costs that are attributable to the acquisttion of the finahoal assets,except in the case of financial assets recorded at fair value through profit or loss.
AH reguiar way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on the trade date, that is, the date that theGroup commits to purchase or sell the asset. Reguiar way purchases or sates are purchases or saies of financial assetsthat require deiivery of assets within the period generaiiy estabiished by regulation or convention in the marketplace.
Subsequent measurement'he subsequent measurement of financiai assets depends on their classification as follows:Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
:inancial assets at fair vaiue through profit or loss inciude financial assets held for trading and financiai assetsdesignated upon initiai recognition as at fair vaiue through profit or ioss. FinanCial assets are ciassified as held forrading it they are acquired for the purpose of sale in the near term‘
ZinanCial assets at fair vaiue through profit or loss are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value withnet changes in fair value presented as ”fair value gain/(loss) on finanCial instruments at fair value through profit or055” of other gains in the statement of profit or loss. These net fair vaiue changes do not inciude any dividends orinterest earned on these finanCIai assets, which are recognised in accordance with the policies set out for Revenuerecognition“ beiow.
ﬁnancial assets designated upon initiai recognition as at fair value through profit or ioss are designated at the date ofinitial recognition and oniy if the criteria in IAS 39 are satisfied.

Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fair value if theireconomic characteristics and risks are not closeiy reiated to those of the host contracts and the host contracts arenot heid for trading or designated as at fair value through profit or loss, These embedded derivatives are measuredat fair vaiue with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Reassessment only occurs if thereis either a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifies the cash flows that would otherwise berequired or a reclassification of a financial asset out of the fair value through profit or loss category.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)Investments and other financial assets (continued)Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments that are not quotedin an active market. After initial measurement, such assets are subsequently measured at amortised cost usmg
the effective interest rate method less any allowance for impairment. Amortised cost is calculated by taking intoaccount any discount or premium on acquisition and includes fees or costs that are an integral part of the effectiveinterest rate. The effective interest rate amortisation is included in the statement of profit or loss, The loss arisingfrom impairment is recognised in the statement of profit or ioss in finance costs for loans and in other expenses forreceivables.
Availab/e-for-sa/e ﬁnancia/ investments
Available-for—sale financiai investments are non-derivative financial assets in listed and unlisted equity investmentsand debt securities. Equity investments classified as avaiiable tor saie are those which are neither ciassified as heldfor trading nor designated as at fair value through profit or loss. Debt securities in this category are those which areintended to be held for an indefinite period of time and which may be soid in response to needs for liquidity or inresponse to changes in market conditions.
After initiai recognition, avaiiabIe-for-saie finanCial investments are subsequently measured at fair value, withunreaiised gains or losses recognised as other comprehensive income in the avai able-for—sale investment revaiuationreserve until the investment is derecognised, at which time the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in the statementof profit or loss in other gains or losses, or until the investment is determined to be impaired, when the cumulativegain or loss is reclassified from the avaiiable-for—saie investment revaluation reserve to the statement of profit or lossin other gains or losses. Interest and diVidends earned whilst holding the availab e-for—sale ﬁnariCial investments arereported as interest income and dividend income, respectively and are recognised in the statement of profit or loss asother gains in accordance with the policies set out for “Revenue recognition” below.
When the fair value of unlisted equity investments cannot be reliably measured because (a) the variabiiity in therange of reasonable fair value estimates is significant for that investment or (b) t e probabilities of the variousestimates Within the range cannot be reasonabiy assessed and used in estimating fair value, such investments arestated at cost iess any impairment losses,
The Group evaluates whether the abiiity and intention to sell its avaiiable—for—saie finanCial assets in the near termare stiii appropriate. When, in rare circumstances, the Group is unabie to trade twese financial assets due to inactivemarkets, the Group may elect to reclassify these financial assets if management 1as the ability and intention to holdthe assets for the foreseeable future or untit maturity.

For a financiai asset reclassified from the available-for»sa|e category, the fair value carrying amount at the date ofreclassification becomes its new amortised cost and any previous gain or loss on that asset that has been recognisedin equity is amortised to profit or loss over the remaining life of the investment using the effective interest rate. Anydifference between the new amortised cost and the maturity amount is also amortised over the remaining iife ofthe asset using the effective interest rate. If the asset is subsequently determined to be impaired, then the amountrecorded in equity is reclassified to the statement of profit or loss.

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)
Derecognition of financial assets
A financial asset (or, where applicable a part of a ﬁnancial asset or part of a group of similar financial assets) isprimarily derecognised (ie, removed from the Group’s consolidated statement of financial position) when:
- the rights to receive cash flows from the asset have expired; or
0 the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from the asset or has assumed an obligation to paythe received cash flows in full without material delay to a third party under a ’pass-through’ arrangement; andeither (a) the Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, or (b) the Group hasneither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset, but has transferred controlof the asset,
When the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an asset or has entered into a pass-througharrangement, it evaluates if and to what extent it has retained the risk and rewards of ownership of the asset. Whenit has neither transferred nor retained substantially all the risks and rewards of the asset not transferred control of theasset, the Group continues to recognise the transferred asset to the extent of the Group’s continuing involvement.In that case, the Group also recognises an associated liability. The transferred asset and the associated liability aremeasured on a basis that reflects the rights and obligations that the Group has retained.
Continuing involvement that takes the form of a guarantee over the transferred asset is measured at the lower of theoriginal carrying amount of the asset and the maximum amount of consideration that the Group could be reqUiredto repay.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objective evidence that a financial assetor a group of financial assets is impaired, An impairment exists if one or more events that occurred after the initialrecognition of the asset have an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the financial asset or the group
of financial assets that can be reliably estimated. Evidence of impairment may include indications that a debtor
or a group of debtors is experiencing significant financial difficulty, default or delinquency in interest or principalpayments, the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation and observable dataindicating that there is a measurable decrease in the estimated future cash flows, such as changes in arrears oreconomic conditions that correlate with defaults.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether impairment exists indiVidually forfinancial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an indiVidually assessed financial asset,whether significant or not, it includes the asset in a group of finanCial assets with similar credit risk characteristicsand collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which animpairment loss is, or continues to be, recognised are not Included in a collective assessment of impairment.
The amount of any impairment loss identified is measured as the difference between the asset’s carwihg amount andthe present value of estimated future cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not yet been incurred). Thepresent value of the estimated future cash flows is discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate(ie, the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition).

2.4 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)Impairment of financial assets (continued)Financia/ assets carried at amortised cost (continued)
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account and the loss is recognised
in the statement of profit or loss. interest income continues to be accrued on the reduced carrying amount usmgthe rate of interest used to discount the future cash flows for the purpose of measuring the impairment iosst Loansand receivabies together with any associated aliowance are written off when there is no reaiistic prospect of futurerecovery and aii coiiateral has been reaiised or has been transferred to the Groups
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the estimated impairment ioss increases or decreases because of an eventoccurring after the impairment was recognised, the previousiy recognised impairment loss is increased or reduced byadjusting the allowance account. if a write-off is iater recovered, the recovery is credited to the statement of profitor loss.
Assets carried at cost
f there is objective eVidence that an impairment ioss has been incurred on an unquoted equity instrument that isnot carried at fair value because its fair vaiue cannot be reliabiy measured, or on a derivative asset that is linked toand must be settled by delivery of such an unquoted equity instrument, the amount of the loss is measured as thedifference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash fiows discounted athe current market rate of return for a similar finanCial asset. Impairment losses on these assets are not reversed,
Availab/e-for-sa/e ﬁnancia/ investments
:or available-for—sale financiai investments, the Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there isobjective evidence that an investment or a group of investments is impaired.
1‘ an avaiiable-for—saie asset is impaired, an amount comprising the difference between its cost (net of any principainayment and amortisation) and its current fair value, iess any impairment loss previously recognised in the statementof profit or loss, is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
n the case of equity investments ciassn‘ied as availabie for sale, objective evidence would include a Signiﬁcant ororolonged decline in the fair value of an investment below its cost. ”Significant” is evaluated against the originai costof the investment and ”prolonged” against the period in which the fair value has been beiow its original cost. Wherehere is eyidence of impairment, the cumulative loss — measured as the difference between the acquisition cost andthe current fair value, less any impairment loss on that investment previousiy recognised in the statement of profit oross i is removed from other comprehensive income and recognised in the statement of profit or loss. Impairmentosses on equity instruments classified as available for sale are not reversed through the statement of profit or ioss.ncreases in their fair vaiue after impairment are recognised directly in other comprehensive income.

’he determination of what is “signiﬁcant” or “prolonged” requires judgement. In making this judgement, the Groupevaluates, among other factors, the duration or extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost.
