Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty defaulton its obligations. The Group's and the Company's exposure to credit risk primarily arises from trade andother receivables. For other financial assets (including investment securities, cash and short-term deposits andderivatives), the Group and the Company minimise credit risk by dealing exclusively with high credit ratingcounterparties.
The Group trades only with recognised and creditworthy third parties, It is the Group’s policy that all customerswho wish to trade on credit terms are subject to credit verification procedures, In addition, receivable balancesare monitored on an ongoing basis and the Group's exposure to bad debts is not significant.
Exposure to credit risk
At the end of the reporting period, the Group's and the Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk is representedby the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised on balance sheets.
Credit risk concentration orofile
The Group’s trading activities are carried out largely in Hong Kong and the PRC, and in the precision componentsand tooling sector
Financial assets that are neither past due nor impaired
Trade and other receivables that are neither past due nor impaired are with creditworthy debtors with goodpayment record with the Group. Cash and short—term deposits, investment securities and derivatives are placedwith or entered into with reputable financial institutions or companies with high credit ratings and no history ofdefault
Financial assets that are either past due or impaired
Information regarding financial assets that are either past due or impaired is disclosed in Note 21.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group and the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligationsdue to shortage of funds. The Group's and the Company’s exposure to liquidity risk arises primarily from
mismatches of the maturity of financial assets and liabilities. The Group’s and the Company’s objective is tomaintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of stand-by credit facilities

Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd)(e) Market risk
Market price risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of the Group’s and the Company's financialinstruments will fluctuate because of changes in the market prices (other than interest or exchange rates). TheGroup and the Company are exposed to price risk arising from its investment in quoted equity and debts securities.These securities are quoted on the stock exchanges of New York, NASDAQ, Tokyo, Hong Kong and DeutscheBbrse Xetra. The securities are classified as held for trading financial assets. The quoted debts securities are issuedfrom their respective companies and subsequently traded between participants directly over—the—counter. Due tothe diversity of qualities, maturities and yields, the prices of debts securities are determined by the willingness ofparticipants to transact at a given price and are usually not quoted by a market maker such as an exchange.
The Group’s objective is to manage investment returns to achieve rea|<term capital preservation and long-termcapital growth.
Sensitiviy analﬁis for grice risk
At the end of the reporting period, if the price of the shares and bonds had been 2% higher/Iower with all othervariables held constant, the Group's profit before tax would have been $296,000 (2016: $307,000) higher/lower,arising as a result of higher/Iower fair value gains on held for trading investments in equity and debts instruments.
Capital management
The priman/ objective of the Group's capital management is to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a goingconcern and to maintain healthy capital ratios in order to support its business and maximise shareholder's value
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions. Tomaintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital toshareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the years ended31 December 2017 and 2016.
As disclosed in Note 29(c), certain subsidiaries of the Group are required by the Foreign Enterprise Law of the PRC tocontribute to and maintain a non-distributable statutory reserve fund whose utilisation is subject to approval by therelevant PRC authorities,
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is net debt divided by total capital The Group includes withinnet debt, total loans and borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Capital includes equity attributable to the ownersof the Company less the fair value adjustment reserve and the above-mentioned restricted statutory reserve fund‘ TheGroup's policy is to keep the gearing ratio below one.

Gazelle had on1 February 2018 submitted a requisition pursuant to their right under section 183 of the Companies Act, Cap 50 (section183) for a resolution to be moved at the Annual General Meeting The reasons for Gazelle’s proposal are set out below:-
(a)
(b)
(d)
No intention to utilise excess funds
The Company has not announced any plan in furtherance of any expansion or business growth which may requireexcess cash to be utilised. Gazelle noted that in the latest announced financial statements of the Company andits subsidiaries (the “Group) for the quarter ended 30 September 2017 (the “Financial Announcement“),it is stated that the Company's subsidiary Mansfield (Thailand) Co.

(”Mansfield Thailand“) would beconstructing a plant in Thailand scheduled for completion in the first half of FY2018, with production andrevenue contributions expected to commence in the second half of FY2018, Until then, operational activitiesin Thailand will be supported from Dongguan. Revenue contribution from Mansfield Thailand is expected togather momentum from FY2019.
here is no suggestion that this plant is a major investment that will impact in any significant manner theCompany's cash reserve or that any need for cash cannot be met by the Company's expected cash generationthrough its ordinary course of business
=inancial position
Based on the Financial Announcement, the Group has cash and cash assets of approximately $47 million of which$15.4 million are “held as trading financial assets. They have been so held since at least 2013. Furthermore,according to the Financial Announcement, the Company is debt-free.
mprovement in financial performance
he performance of the Company has improved significantly in the past two years For the financial year ended31 December 2016 (FY16), net profitafter tax increased to $116 million in FY16 from a net loss after tax of$163 million in the previous financial year.
:or the nine months ended 30 September 2017, the Group achieved a net profit after tax of $71 million despitean extraordinary increase of tax payable from $2.9 million to $4.7 million or a 62% increase over the previous yeah
Reward for loyalty
he declaration of dividends of 7.5 cents per share would reward members of the Company for their loyaltyand support, and would in some measure, compensate them for the poor dividend distribution in recent years,contrary to the Company's practices in past periods.

Shareholder valueThis resolution will greatly enhance shareholder value to the betterment of the Company and Group, raise itsprofile as a stable value investment and facilitate its future expansion programs,
After careful deliberation, the Directors do not accept the proposal by Gazelle and the Company's response toGazelle's requisition under section 183 is as follows:-
1)
The net profit after tax (NPAT”) of $98 million for 2017 is lower than the NPAT of $11.6 million for 2016‘However, despite the lower profit made by the Company in 2017, the Directors are recommending a one-tier(tax-exempt) dividend payment of 1.0 cent per share, doubling the dividend of 05 cent per share paid last year.
The Directors believe in a sustainable dividend policy and does not consider that 75 cents dividend will besustainable.
The Company has embarked on two major projects: Mansfield Thailand and Mansfield Technology (Weihai) Co.Ltd‘, which require substantial capital investment in addition to start—up expenses and working capital.

RISK MANAGEMENT
InnoTek acknowledges that appropriate management of the risks accompanying its business is vital to prevent losses anddamages in the fast-changing business environment. The Board has put in place processes and procedures which help toidentify and manage areas of significant strategic, business and financial risks. The Group manages risk under an overall riskmanagement framework determined by the Board and supported by the Audit and Risk Management Committee and InternalAudit, Management periodically reviews the past performance of, and profiles the current and future risks facing the GroupsThis system by its nature can only provide reasonable, but not absolute, assurance to investors regarding:
the safeguarding and protection of the Group’s assets against unauthorised or improper use or disposal;protection against material misstatements or losses;
the maintenance of proper accounting records;
the reliability of financial information used within the business and for publication;
the compliance with appropriate legislations, regulations and best practices; and
the identification and containment of business risks.
Among the various risks that affect the Group include, but are not limited to:
1.
Industry and customer risk
The market demands and customers specific requirements constantly remind the Company not to be complacent andto keep up and be able to cater to the needs in the market and of its customers. In the event the Company is unableto meet customer and industry requirements, there may be a possibility that its products and/or process will becomeobsolete, and its customers may take their business to those who are able to meet such requirements. As such, theCompany works closely with its customers and industry sources to ensure that its technology and product roadmaps arein line with customer requirements.
Under utilisation of production capacity
The Company’s business is characterised by high fixed costs including plant facilities, manufacturing equipment andmachineriest In the event when it's capacity utilisation decreases due to poor demand or cancellation or delay ofcustomer orders, the Company could encounter significantly higher unit production costs, lower margins and potentiallysignificant losses Under utilisation of production capacity could also result in equipment write-offs, restructuring chargesand employee layoffs
Dependence on a small customer base
In the highly competitive industry with low margin and customers could easily bring their orders elsewhere, the lossof one or more of its major customers or a substantial reduction in orders by any major customer, for any reason,could have a material adverse effect on the Group’s revenue. To mitigate the risk of losing customer the Companyworks closely with its customers, so as to be able to build long term working relationships and, hence, build long-termcustomers’ trust and loyalty.
Primary materials prices and timely supply of materialsThe Group relies on a limited number of qualified suppliers for some of the materials used in its precision metal
component division manufacturing processes. Any increase in the price of primary materials would affect the cost ofmanufacturing. The Group mitigates the risk by not committing to large orders of fixed price materials thus enabling

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
the Group to adjust prices when appropriate and feasible. The timely supply of sufficient quantity of raw materials byits supplier is also crucial in meeting the commitments to its customers. To mitigate the risk the Group employs supplychain management and builds long term relationships with qualified suppliers.
5. Exposure to credit risks
The Group is exposed to credit risks of its customers. From time to time, in the ordinary course of business, certaincustomers may default on their payment. Such events may arise due to the inherent risk from its customers’ business,risk pertaining to the political, economic, social and legal environment of its customers’ jurisdiction and foreign exchangeriskt However, the Group regularly reviews its exposure by way of monthly management reports, market feedbacks,performing checks on customers’ financial status and executes necessary payment recovery measures to minimise itscredit risks
6. Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases that are denominated in a currenq/other then the respective functional currencies of the Group entities. The Group manages its transactional currenq/exposures by matching as far as possible, its receipts and payments in each individual currency.
7. Liquidity risk
To ensure that it has adequate funding to achieve these requirements and its long-term goals, the Group regularlymonitors its capital expenditure to ensure an appropriate rate of returns, monitors the efficiency of the investment andpursues new financing opportunities to supplement its current capital resources.
8. Changes in the political, social and economic conditions
The Group’s manufacturing facilities are located mainly in China. Any unfavourable changes in the political, social, legal,regulatory and economic conditions in China may disrupt our operations and affect our financial performance
Regulatory changes could result in increased costs to the Group, The Group continues to evaluate and monitordevelopments with respect to new and proposed rules and regulations by the local authorities in the different provincesin China which can or may affect the Group in any way, and cannot predict or estimate the amount of additional coststhe Group may incur or the timing of such costs.
SUSTAINABILITY REPORTING
The Board recognises that to ensure business is sustainable; the Group has to strike a balance between its business needs andthe need of the society and the environment in which the Group operates. The Board believes that to grow sustainably, theGroup has to regularly reach out to all stakeholders, from its employees to the community, and to be responsible stewards ofits natural environment The Group’s efforts to employ eco-friendly and sustainable value chain processes, training programmesfor its employees, interaction and cooperation with the communities, its anti-corruption procedures and the relevant policy toensure health, safety and welfare of its employees and other sustainability issues will be released in a stand-alone report to itsshareholders before the end of this year.

INNOTEK LiMITEDiANNUAL REPORT 2017
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
For the tiiiahtiai year eiided 31 Detemher 2017
Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of lnnoTek LimitedReport on the Audit of the Financial StatementsOpinion
We have audited the financial statements of lnnoTek Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group“),which comprise the balance sheets of the Group and the Company as at 31 December 2017, the statements of changes inequity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated income statement, consolidated statement of comprehensiveincome and consolidated cash flow statement of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements,including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the balance sheet and the statement ofchanges in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act, Chapter50 (the Act) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (“FRSs”) so as to give a true and fair view of the consolidatedfinanciai position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and of the consolidatedfinanciai performance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash flows of the Group and changes in equity of theCompany for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAS). Our responsibilities under thosestandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section of our report.We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Codeof Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code”) together with the ethicalrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethicalresponsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code, We believe that the audit evidence we haveobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financialstatements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as awhoie, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below,our description of how our audit addressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements sectionof our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed torespond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financiai statements. The results of our audit procedures,including the procedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanyingfinanciai statements
Impairment of Trade Receivables
The gross balance of the Group's trade receivables as of 31 December 2017 is $65.4 million, against which allowance for doubtfuldebts of $0.9 million was made. The impairment assessment of trade receivables requires management to exercise significantjudgement on trade debtors' ability to repay after taking into account the Group’s operating environments that continue to bechallenging due to slower domestic growth, rising labour costs and intense competition. The collectability of trade receivables isalso a key element of the Group’s working capital management, which is managed on an ongoing basis by management.
As part of our audit, we obtained an understanding of the processes and controls relating to the monitoring of tradereceivabies. Our audit procedures included, amongst others, requesting confirmation of trade receivable balances and reviewingfor collectability by way of obtaining evidence of receipts from the customers subsequent to the year—end. We evaluatedmanagement's assumptions used to determine the amount of allowance for doubtful debts, through testing of ageing forsampies of trade receivables and assessment of significant overdue trade receivables by reviewing historical payment patternsand whether any payments subsequent to year—end had been received up to the date of completing our audit procedures. Inevaluating management’s determination of allowance for doubtful debts, we considered the facts and circumstances specificto the countries and economic environments where the subsidiaries operate in. We also assessed the adequacy of the Group'sdisclosures related to the impairment of trade receivables and the related risks such as credit risk and liquidity risk included inNote 21 Trade and other receivables and Note 34 Financial risk management objectives and policies,

Independent Auditor's Report to the Members of lnnoTek Limited (cont'd)Key Audit Matters (cont’d)Allowance for Inventory Obsolescence
The gross balance of the Group’s inventories as of 31 December 2017 is $25.8 million, against which allowance for inventoryobsolescence of $0.8 million was made. The determination of allowance for inventory obsolescence requires management toexercise significant judgement in identifying slow moving or obsolete inventories and making estimates of their net realisablevalues, This process is particularly complicated for inventories that are components of customers' products that are reaching orhave reached their end-of-Iife,
As part of our audit, we attended and observed physical inventory counts at all material inventory locations where weperformed procedures to identify slow moving and obsolete inventories We tested management’s ageing analyses for samplesof inventories by re—performing the ageing calculation and discussed with management on how slow moving inventoriesfor selected samples are dealt with We obtained an understanding of the analyses and assessments made by managementwith respect to slow moving and obsolete inventories and end-of-life products, including the specific identification of theseinventories, and tested the adequacy of the allowance made by management by comparing the net carrying amount ofinventories to their net realisable values We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the allowance for inventoryobsolescence included in Note 20 Inventories

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate toprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher thanfor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or theoverride of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriatein the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relateddisclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the auditevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubton the Group's ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are requiredto draw attention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures areinadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of ourauditor’s report However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern‘
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures, and whetherthe financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
0 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activitieswithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsible for the direction,supervision and performance of the group audit We remain solely responsible for our audit opiniont
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significantaudit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear onour independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the auditof the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in ourauditor's report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so wouldreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication}

SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
SFRS(I) 15 establishes a five-step model to account for revenue arismg from contracts with customers, and introducesnew contract cost guidance Under SFRS(I) 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration whichan entity expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer, The new revenue standardis effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018,
The Group has performed a preliminary assessment of adopting SFRS(|) 15 based on currently available information.This assessment may be subject to changes arising from ongoing analysis until the Group adopts SFRS(I) 15 in 2018.
The Group plans to apply the changes in accounting policies retrospective to each reporting year presented, using thefull retrospective approach. The Group also plans to apply the follow1ng practical expedients:
, For completed contracts, the Group plans not to restate completed contracts that begin and end within thesame year or are completed contracts on 1 January 2017; and
— For completed contracts that have variable consideration, the Group plans to use the transaction price at thedate the contract was completed instead of estimating variable consideration amounts in the comparative years
The Group is in a business of manufacture and sale of moulds and precision metal stamping and assembly components.The Group expects the following impact upon adoption of SFRS(I) 15:

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Standards issued but not yet effective (cont'd)
SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (cont’d)Manufacture and sale of moulds
The Group currently recognises revenue from the sale of moulds when significant risks and rewards of the moulds aretransferred to the customer, which coincides with delivery of moulds to the customer. For certain contracts, where thecustomer requires the moulds revenue to be amortised over the quantity of stamping components delivered, revenueon such moulds is recognised when significant risks and rewards of the stamping components are transferred to thecustomer, which coincides with delivery of stamping components to the customer.
Under SFRS(I) 15, manufacture of moulds is considered a separate performance obligation and hence, the transactionprice will be allocated between the manufacture of moulds and stamping components on a relative stand-alone sellingprice basis and recognised separately. Revenue from manufacture of moulds are satisfied at a point in time as the Groupdoes not have enforceable right to payment for performance completed to-date. Accordingly, some of the revenue frommanufacture of moulds, currently recognised over the quantity of stamping components delivered will be adjusted uponadoption of SFRS(I) 15 to recognise revenue when the customer obtains control of the moulds. The Group does notexpect any significant impact to arise from this change.
SFRStl) 9 Financial Instruments
SFRS(I) 9 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment of financialassets and hedge accounting, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018‘ Financial assetsare classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business model under which they areheld The impairment requirements in SFRS(I) 9 are based on an expected credit loss model and replace the SFRS(I) 1-39incurred loss modelt
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date without restating prior periods' informationand recognises any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at the beginning of theannual reporting period at the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings.
'he Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting SFRS(I) 9 based on currently available information,'his assessment may be subject to changes arising from ongoing analysis, until the Group adopts SFRS(I) 9 in 2018‘
SFRS(|) 9 requires the Group and the Company to record expected credit losses on all its loans and trade receivables,either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expectedosses on all trade receivables The Group does not expect any significant impact to arise from the adoption of SFRS(I) 9.
SFRStI) 16 Leases
SFRS(I) 16 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reflect the rights to use the leased assets andhe associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciation charges,'he standard includes two recognition exemption for lessees — leases of ’low value’ assets and short-term leases. Thenew standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019,
’he Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of SFRS(I) 16 and expects that the adoptionof SFRS(I) 16 will result in increase in total assets, total liabilities and gearing ratio.

'he Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date by applying SFRS(I) 16 retrospectively with thecumulative effective of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 January2019.
'he Group is currently in the process of analysing the transitional approaches and practical expedients to be elected onransition to SFRS(I) 16 and assessing the possible impact of adoption

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at theend of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidatedﬁnancial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are
applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-group transactionsand dividends are eliminated in fulL
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, andcontinue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Losses within a subsidian/ are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deficit balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transactionIf the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
— derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the datewhen controls is lost;
— derecognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
— derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;— recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
— recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
— recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss; and
— reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit orloss or retained earnings, as appropriate.
Foreign currency
The financial statements are presented in SGD, which is also the Company's functional currency. Each entity in the Groupdetermines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured usingthat functional currency.
(a) Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and itssubsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximatingthose ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies aretranslated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period, Non-monetary items that aremeasured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the datesof the initial transactions Non-monetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated usingthe exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising 0n the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the endof the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Foreign currency (cont'd)(b) Consolidated financial statements
For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into SGD at the rate ofexchange ruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange ratesprevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognisedin other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensiveincome relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss,
Exchange differences arising on monetary items that form part of the Group’s net investment in foreignoperations are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated under foreign currencytranslation reserve in equity The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassified from equity to profit or lossof the Group on disposal of the foreign operation.
Property, plant and equipment
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost, Subsequent to recognition, property, plant andequipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-Iine basis over the estimated useful iives of the assets as follows:
Leasehold buildings — 10 to 25 yearsMachinery and equipment — 5 to 10 yearsFurniture, fittings and office equipment — 3 to 10 yearsMotor vehicles — 5 yearsLeasehold improvements — 5 to 20 years
Assets under construction included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yetavailable for use.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year—end, and adjustedprospectively, if appropriate.
An Item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits areexpected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arises on derecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in theyear the asset is derecognised.
Investment properties
Investment properties are properties that are held to earn rentals or for capitai appreciation, or both, rather than for usein the production or supply of goods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business.Investment properties comprise completed investment properties. Properties held under operating leases are classifiedas investment properties when the definition of an investment property is met.
Investment properties are initially measured at cost, including transaction costs.
Subsequent to initial recognition, investment properties are measured at fair value. Gains or losses arising from changesin the fair values of investment properties are included in profit or loss in the year in which they arise.
Investment properties are derecognised when either they have been disposed of or when the investment property ispermanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gains or losses onthe retirement or disposal of an investment property are recognised in profit or loss in the year of retirement or disposal.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Prepaid land lease payments
Prepaid land lease payments under operating leases are initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, prepaidland lease payments are measured at cost less accumulated amortisation. The prepaid land lease payments are amortisedon a straight—line basis over the lease terms of 47 to 49 years.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost, Foliowing initial acquisition, intangible assetsare carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Internally generatedintangible assets, excluding capitalised development costs, are not capitaiised and expenditure is reflected in profit orloss in the year in which the expenditure is incurred
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as finite.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairmentwhenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisationmethod are reviewed at least at each financial year—end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expected pattern ofconsumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation periodor method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between the net disposalproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or ioss when the asset is derecognised‘
Computer softwareComputer software was acquired separately and is amortised on a straight-iine basis over its finite useful lives of 5 years.Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired If any indicationexists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset’srecoverable amount
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposal and itsvalue in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largelyindependent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cash-generatingunit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determinethe asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised} If that is the case, the carrying amountof the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carwing amount that would havebeen determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously Such reversal is recognisedin profit or loss.
SubsidiariesA subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or hasrights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its
power over the investee‘
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairmentlosses.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Joint arrangement
A joint arrangement is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties have joint control. Joint control is thecontractually agreed sharing of control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activitiesrequire the unanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
A joint arrangement is classified either as joint operation or joint venture, based on the rights and obligations of theparties to the arrangement
To the extent the joint arrangement provides the Group with rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilitiesrelating to the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint operation. To the extent the joint arrangement provides theGroup with rights to the net assets of the arrangement, the arrangement is a joint venture.
The Group recognises its interest in a joint venture as an investment and accounts for the investment using the equitymethod. The accounting policy for investment in joint venture is set out in Note 2.13.
Joint venture
The Group account for its investment in joint venture using the equity method from the date on which it becomes ajoint venture.
On acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fair valueof the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwili and is included in the carrying amount of theinvestment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities overthe cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the entity’s share of the joint venture's profit orloss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
Under the equity method, the investment in joint venture is carried in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisitionchanges in the Group’s share of net assets of the joint venture. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of theoperations of the joint venture, Distributions received from joint venture reduce the carrying amount of the investmentWhere there has been a change recognised in other comprehensive income by the joint venture, the Group recognisesits share of such changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactionsbetween the Group and joint venture are eliminated to the extent of the interest in the joint venture.
When the Group's share of losses in a joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the joint venture, the Group does notrecognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint venture
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additionalimpairment loss on the Group's investment in joint venture. The Group determines at the end of each reporting periodwhether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the joint venture is Impaired. If this is the case, the Groupcalculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the joint venture and itscarrying value and recognises the amount in profit or loss.
The financial statements of the joint venture are prepared as the same reporting date as the Company Where necessary,adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group‘
Upon loss of joint control over the joint venture, the Group measures the retained interest at fair value. Any differencebetween the fair value of the aggregate of the retained interest and proceeds from disposal and the carrying amount ofthe investment at the date the equity method was discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.

2.14 Financialinstruments
(a)
Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisionsof the financial instrument The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognitiont
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assetsnot at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their ciassification as follows:
(i)
(ii)
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assets held for trading. Financial assetsare classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in thenear term. This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group. Derivatives,including separated embedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at fair vaiue through profit or loss are measured at fairvalue. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognised in profitor loss. Net gains or net losses on financial assets at fair vaiue through profit or loss include exchangedifferences. Interest income and dividend income on financial assets at fair value through profit or lossare recognised separately in profit or loss.
Derivatives embedded in host contracts are accounted for as separate derivatives and recorded at fairvalue if their economic characteristics and risks are not closeiy related to those of the host contracts andthe host contracts are not measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.These embedded derivatives are measured at fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit orloss Reassessment only occurs if there is a change in the terms of the contract that significantly modifiesthe cash flows that would otherwise be required.
Loans and receivables
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinabie payments that are not quoted in an activemarket are classified as loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables aremeasured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses arerecognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivabies are derecognised or impaired, and throughthe amortisation process.
Derecognition
A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired.On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sumof the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensiveincome is recognised in profit or loss.

(b)
Financial liabilitiesInitial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisionsof the financial instruments The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognitions
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair valuethrough profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurementThe measurement of financial liabilities depends on their classification as follows:(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial liabilities held for trading. Financialliabilities are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term.This category includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that are not designatedas hedging instruments in hedge relationships. Separated embedded derivatives are also classified as heldfor trading unless they are designated as effective hedging instruments.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are measured atfair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial liabilities are recognisedin profit or loss.
(ii) Financial liabilities at amortised cost
After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss aresubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method. Gains and losses arerecognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.
Derecognition
A financial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expiresWhen an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms,or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as aderecognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new iiability, and the difference in the respectivecarrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
2.15 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
(a)
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairmentexists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that arenot individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for anindividually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not. it includes the asset in a group of financial assetswith similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individuallyassessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss IS, or continues to be recognised are not included ina collective assessment of impairment.

Impairment of financial assets (cont'd)
(a)
(b)
Financial assets carried at amortised cost (cont'd)
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has beenincurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and thepresent value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financial assets original effective interest rate. Ifa loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the current effectiveinterest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account. Theimpairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced directly or ifan amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowance account are writtenoff against the carrying value of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has been incurred,the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtorand default or significant delay in payments.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be relatedobjectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairmentloss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at thereversal date. The amount of reversal is recognised in profit or loss,
Financial assets carried at cost
If there is objective evidence (such as significant adverse changes in the business environment where the issueroperates, probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the issuer) that an impairment loss onfinancial assets carried at cost had been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference betweenthe asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the currentmarket rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such impairment losses are not reversed in subsequent periods.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and short—term, highly liquidinvestments that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk ofchanges in value.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to theirpresent location and condition are accounted for as follows:
Raw materials: purchase costs on a first—in first-out basis.
Finished goods and work-in-progress: costs of direct materiais and labour and a proportion of manufacturingoverheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a first—in first—out basis.
Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying value ofinventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completionand the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.

(a)
(b)
General
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a pastevent, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle theobligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliabiy.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate.If it is no longer probable that an outflow of economic resources wiii be required to settle the obligation, theprovision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using acurrent pre—tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used,the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost.
Restructuring provision
Restructuring provisions are only recognised when genera] recognition criteria for provisions are fulfilled.Additionally, the Group needs to follow a detailed formal pian about the business or part of the businessconcerned, the location and number of employees affected, a detailed estimate of the associated costs andappropriate time-Iine. The people affected have a valid expectation that the restructuring is being carried out orthe implementation has been initiated already.
Government grants
Government grants are recognised when there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attachingconditions will be complied with.
Borrowing costs
Ail borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that anentity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.
Employee benefits
(a)
(b)
(C)
Defined contribution plans
The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it hasoperations. In particular, the Company makes contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore,3 defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognisedas an expense in the period in which the related service is performed,
Employee leave entitlement
Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they are accrued to the employees.The undiscounted liability for leave expected to be settled wholly before twelve months after the end of thereporting period is recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period.
Termination benefit
Termination benefits are employee benefits provided in exchange for the termination of an employee's employmentas a result of either an entity’s decision to terminate an employee’s empioyment before the normal retirement dateor an employee’s decision to accept an offer of benefits in exchange for the termination of employment.
A liability and expense for a termination benefits is recognised at the earlier of when the entity can no longerwithdraw the offer of those benefits and when the entity recognises related restructuring costs. Initial recognitionand subsequent changes to termination benefits are measured in accordance with the nature of the employmentbenefits, short-term employee benefits, or other Iong-term employee benefits.

Employee share option plans
Employees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share options asconsideration for services rendered. The cost of these equity-settled share based payment transactions withemployees is measured by reference to the fair value of the options at the date on which the options are grantedwhich takes into account market conditions and non-vesting conditions, This cost is recognised in profit or loss,with a corresponding increase in the employee share option reserve, over the vesting periods The cumulativeexpense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects the extent to which the vesting periodhas expired and the Group's best estimate of the number of equity instruments that will ultimately vest. Thecharge or credit to profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised as atthe beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expenses
The employee share option reserve is transferred to retained earnings upon expiry of the share options
As lessee
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of theleased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at thepresent value of the minimum lease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalisedtLease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achievea constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to profit or lossContingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they are incurred
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the leaseterm, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-Iine basis over the leaseterm. The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expenseover the lease term on a straight-line basis.
As lessor
Leases where the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset areclassified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to thecarrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income. Theaccounting policy for rental income is set out in Note 2.23(d). Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in theperiod in which they are earned.
Revenue
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and therevenue can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is made. Revenue is measured at the fair value ofconsideration received or receivable, taking into account contractually defined terms of payment and excluding taxesor duty.
(a)
Sale of goods
Revenue from sale of goods is recognised upon the transfer of significant risk and rewards of ownership of thegoods to the customer, usually on delivery of goods. Revenue is not recognised to the extent where there aresignificant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return ofgoods,

(b) Deferred tax (cont'd)The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of thedeferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting
period and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow thedeferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when theasset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantivelyenacted at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred tax are recognised in the profit or loss except that deferred tax relating to items recognised outsideprofit or loss is recognised either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.
(c) Sales tax
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
— Where the sales tax incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxationauthority, in which case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the asset or as partof the expense item as applicable; and
— Receivables and payables that are stated with the amount of sales tax included.
Share capital and share issue expenses
Proceeds from issuance of ordinary shares are recognised as share capital in equtty. Incremental costs directly attributableto the issuance of ordinary shares are deducted against share capital.
Treasury shares
The Group's own equity instruments, which are reacquired (“treasury shares”) are recognised at cost and deductedfrom equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’sown equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount of treasury shares and the consideration received,
if reissued, is recognised directly in equity. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for the Group and nodividends are allocated to them respectively.
ContingenciesA contingent liability is:
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrenceor non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle theobligation; or
(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by theoccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group.

Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimatesand assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure ofcontingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates couldresult in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrylng amount of the asset or liability affected in thefuture periods:
Judgement made in applying accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements whichhave the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
(a)
(b)
(C)
Classification between investment properties and owner-occupied properties
The Group determines whether a property qualifies as an investment property, and has developed criteria inmaking that judgement. Investment property is a property held to earn rentals or for capital appreciation orboth. Therefore, the Group considers whether a property generates cash flows largely independently of theother assets held by the Group. Some properties comprise a portion that is held to earn rentals or for capitalappreciation and another portion that is held for use in the production or supply of goods or services or foradministrative purposes. If these portions could be sold separately or leased out separately under a financelease, the Group accounts for the portions separately. If the portions could not be sold separately, the propertyis an investment property only if an insignificant portion is held for use in the production or supply of goods orservices or for administrative purposes. Judgement is made on an individual property basis to determine whetherancillary services are so significant that a property does not qualify as an investment property. The carryingamount of the Group's investment properties at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 14:
Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profitwill be available against which the losses can be utilised. Significant management judgement is required todetermine the amount of deferred tax assets that can be recognised, based upon the timing and level of futuretaxable profits together with future tax planning strategies. In determining the timing and level of future taxableprofits together with future tax planning strategies, the Group assessed the probability of expected future cashinflows based on expected revenues from existing orders and contracts for the next three years.
Where taxable profits are expected in the foreseeable future, deferred tax assets are recognised for unused taxlosses. The carrying amounts of the recognised tax losses and the unrecognised tax losses as at 31 December2017 were nil (2016: $13,305,000) and $37,526,000 (2016: $37,045,000) respectively. If the Group was ableto recognise all unrecognised deferred tax assets, profit would increase by $8,617,000 (2016: $8,343,000).
Income taxes
The Group has exposure to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions: Significant judgement is involved indetermining the group-wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations forwhich the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business The Group recognisesliabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. Where the finaltax outcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were Initially recognised, such differenceswill impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Thecarrying amounts of the Group’s income tax payable, deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities as at 31December 2017 were $5,552,000 (2016: $2,944,000), $861,000 (2016: $3,265,000) and $2,334,000 (2016$2,214,000) respectively. The carrying amounts of the Company's income tax payable and deferred tax liabilitiesas at 31 December 2017 were $42,000 (2016: $1,000) and $430,000 (2016 $318,000) respectively.

Significant accounting judgements and estimates (cont'd)
Key sources of estimates uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reportingperiod are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financialstatements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may changedue to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in theassumptions when they occur.
(a)
(b)
(C)
(d)
Impairment of loans and receivables
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a loan orreceivable is impaired‘ Factors such as the probability of insolvency or significantfinancial difficulties of the debtorand default or significant delay in payments are objective evidence of impairment. In determining whether thereis objective evidence of impairment, the Group considers whether there is observable data indicating that therehave been significant changes in the debtor's payment ability or whether there have been significant changeswith adverse effect in the technological, market, economic or legal environment in which the debtor operatesin.
Where there is objective evidence of impairment, the amount and timing of future cash flows are estimatedbased on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit risk characteristics. The carrying amounts of theGroup's and the Company's loans and receivables at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 21 .
Useful lives and residual value of property, plant and equipment
The Group determines the residual values, useful lives and related depreciation charges for the Group’s property,plant and equipment These estimates are based on the historical experience of the actual residual values anduseful lives of property, plant and equipment of similar nature and functions. They could change significantly asa result of technical innovations and competitor actions in response to severe industn/ cycles. Management willincrease the depreciation charges where residual values or useful lives are less than previously estimated, or it willwrite down technically obsolete or non-strategic assets that have been abandoned or sold‘ Actual economic livesmay differ from estimated useful lives. Periodic review could results in a change in depreciable lives and thereforedepreciation in the future periods The carrying amounts of the Group’s and the Company's property, plant andequipment at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 13.
Employee share options
The Group measures the cost of equity-settled transactions with employees by reference to the fair value ofthe equity instruments at the date at which they are granted, Estimating fair value for share-based paymenttransactions requires determining the most appropriate valuation model, which is dependent on the terms andconditions of the grant. This estimate also requires determining the most appropriate inputs to the valuationmodel including the expected life of the share option, volatility and dividend yield and making assumptionsabout them The assumptions and models used for estimating fair value for share-based payment transactionsare disclosed in Note 30‘
Fair value of investment properties
Investment property is measured at its fair value. The fair vaiue was based on a valuation on the propertyconducted by an independent firm of professional valuers using property valuation techniques which involvemaking assumptions on certain market conditions. Favourable or unfavourable changes to these assumptionswould result in changes in the fairvalue of the Group's investment properties, and the corresponding adjustmentsto the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss The carrying amount of the investment properties at the end ofthe reporting period is disclosed in Note 14.
Further details including the key assumptions used for fair value measurement are given in Note 33.

(f)
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The carrying amounts of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events orchanges in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts may not be recoverable. The recoverable amount ofan item of property, plant and equipment is the higher of its fair value less costs of disposal and value in use,the calculations of which involve the use of estimates. In estimating the recoverable amounts of assets, variousassumptions, including future cash flows to be associated with the assets and discount rates are made. If futureevents do not correspond to such assumptions, the recoverable amounts will need to be revised, and this mayhave an impact on the Group’s results of operations or financial position.
There has been no impairment loss recognised for the financial years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016‘ Thecarrying amount of the property, plant and equipment at the end of the reporting period is disclosed in Note 13‘
Inventory obsolescence
Management reviews the condition of inventories and makes allowance against obsolete and slow movinginventory items and end-of-Iife products which are identified as no longer suitable for sale or use. This reviewinvolves comparison of the carrying value of the inventory items with the respective net realisable value.Management estimates the net realisable value for such inventories based primarily on the latest invoice pricesand current market conditions. The carrying amount of the Group’s allowance for inventory obsolescence as at31 December 2017 was $780,000 (2016: $956,000).

For the financial year ended 31 December 2017, the corporate income tax rate applicable to the Company is 17%(2016: 17%). For the subsidiaries operating in Hong Kong and the PRC, income taxes are calculated using domestic taxrates of 16.5% (2016: 16.5%) and 25% (2016: 25%) respectively.
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share amounts are calculated by dividing the profit, net of tax, attributable to owners of the Companyby the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the financial yeari
Diluted earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit, net of tax, attributable to owners of the Company by theweighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the ﬁnancial year plus the weighted average numberof ordinary shares that would be issued on the conversion of all the dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinaryshares.
The following table reflects the profit and loss data used in the computation of the basic and diluted earnings per sharefor the years ended 31 December 2017 and 2016:

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICERMESSAGE
Dear Valued Shareholders,
lam pleased to present the annual report for InnoTek Limited (“|nnoTei< or the ”Group) for the financial year ended 31December 2017 (FY'17), It has been almost two years since I joined the Board as Executive Director and Chief ExecutiveOfficer of Mansfield Manufacturing Company Limited (“Mansfield”), InnoTek's main operating subsidiary‘
As sharehoiders are aware, I was re—designated as Group Chief Executive Officer in March 2017 to better reﬂect my rolein leading the team through the arduous journey of restructuring and stabilising our core business. We worked withmanagement and employees to improve cash flows, customer engagement and operational efficiencies, even as westrengthened our product offerings through employees training and technoiogical innovation.
These tough measures were essential for us to stay profitable and competitive at a time when customers across all ourbusiness segments — office automation (”0A), TV and automotive — are cutting costs, I am grateful to the InnoTek familyfor their support and resilience through this transformative periodtWhile it has not been an easy road, we are now poisedto recognise the frurts of our labour in FY’18 and beyond.
HNANCIAL PERFORMANCE
FY’17 revenue dipped 1.0% to $212.7million from $214.7 million in FY‘16,due to lower sales of OA and consumerproducts as Japanese customers movedproduction out of China. This was offsetby higher sales of heat sinks — a newproduct which we introduced in the firsthalf of FY’17, and can be used in TVs andcomputers — as well as TV bezels and car
MR. LOU YILIANG diSP'aY Pam's}Chief Executive Officer

The TV segment, which typically has lowermargins, overtook CA as our main revenuecontributor this year, accounting for 39%of saies in the last three months of FY’17.
The Group’s net profit after tax was $9.8miiiion in FY’17, a drop from last year’s$11.6 million mainly due to higher taxexpenses. However, we were heartened tosee that our profit before tax was $15.8miiiion in FY'17, $2.0 million higher thanthe $13.8 million in FY'16.
InnoTek’s net cash position improved to$35.8 million as at 31 December 2017compared to $300 million a year earlier,due to positive cash flows from operations.

At the end of the reporting period, no deferred tax liability (2016: Nil) has been recognised for taxes that would bepayable on the undistributed earnings of the Group's subsidiaries and joint venture as:
— The Group has determined that undistributed earnings of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeablefuture; and
— The joint venture of the Group cannot distribute its earnings until it obtains the consent of both the venturers.At the end of the reporting period, the Group does not foresee giving such consent.
Such temporary differences for which no deferred tax liability has been recognised aggregate to $9,662,000 (2016:$3,552,000)
Unrecognised deferred tax assets
At the end of reporting period, the Group has tax losses of approximately $37,526,000 (2016: $37,045,000), that areavailable for offset against future taxable profits of the companies in which the losses arose, for which no deferred taxasset is recognised due to uncertainty of its recoverability. The use of these tax losses is subject to the agreement withthe tax authorities and compliance with certain provisions of the tax legislation of the respective countries in which theGroup operates. The tax losses arising from the PRC subsidiaries will expire in one to five years.

BUSlNESS REVIEW
The manufacturing sector in China has been beset bychallenges such as wage inflation, higher raw materialprices and other operating costs Several companies —including major Japanese customers in the 0A segment— have transferred operations from China to lower-costSoutheast Asian countries such as Vietnam and Thailand
To strengthen our synergies with these key customers,we have incorporated a subsidiary in Thailand,Mansfield (Thailand) Co. Ltd. (“Mansfield Thailand).We expect to complete construction of the plant in thesecond quarter of 2018 and commence production inthe second half of 2018. Until then, we will supportthe operations in Thailand from our Dongguan facilities.
While CA has taken a backseat as our top revenuedriver, our business in China still holds promise In thethird quarter of 2017, we incorporated a subsidiaryin Weihai, China, Mansfield Technology (Weihai) Co.Ltd. (Mansfield Weihai”). In January 2018, it passedHewlett Packard's (HP) audit requirements for newfacilities. Mansfield Weihai can now support HP'sprinter—related operations, following the electronicsgiant's US$105 billion acquisition of Samsung’s printerbusiness in China.

33. Fair value of assets and liabilities
(a) Fair value hierarchy
The Group categorises fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation
inputs used as follows:
' Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can
access at the measurement date;
0 Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or
liability, either directly or indirectly; and
0 Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability
Fair value measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the samelevel of the fair value hierarchy as the lowest level input that is Significant to the entire measurement.

The following is a description of the valuation techniques and inputs used in the fair value measurement forassets and liabilities that are categorised within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy:
Dgrivativgg
Forward currency contracts are valued using a valuation techmque with market observable inputs. The mostfrequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricmg models, using present value calculations. Themodels incorporate various inputs including the credit quality of counterpar’ties, foreign exchange spot, forward
rates and forward rate curves.

Under the income approach, more specifically a term and reversion analysis, fair value is estimated byconsidering the capitalised rental incomes derived from the existing tenancies with due provision for anyreversionary income potential of the property at appropnate reversionary yield and where appropriatecross checking to comparable sales evidences as avallable In the relevant market subject to suitableadjustments between the property and the comparable properties.
For commercial investment properties, a significant increase/(decrease) in the market rental and passingrent would result in a significant increase/decrease) in the fair value of the investment properties. Asignificant increase/(decrease) in the capitalisation rate would result in a significant decrease/(increase) inthe fair value of the investment property.

Valuation policies and procedures
For all significant financial reporting valuations using valuation models and significant unobservableinputs, it is the Group’s policy to engage external valuation experts who possess the relevant credentialsand knowledge on the subject of valuation, valuation methodologies and FRS 113 fair value measurementguidance to perform the valuation.
For valuations performed by external valuation experts, the appropriateness of the valuationmethodologies and assumptions adopted are reviewed along with the appropriateness and reliability ofthe inputs (including those developed internally by the Group) used in the valuations.
In selecting the appropriate valuation models and Inputs to be adopted for each valuation that usessignificant non-observable inputs, external valuation experts are requested to calibrate the valuationmodels and inputs to actual market transactions (which may Include transactions entered into bythe Group with third parties as appropriate) that are relevant to the valuation if such information arereasonably available. For valuations that are sensitive to the unobservable inputs used, reputable externalvaluation experts will be engaged to ensure valuation are properly executed according to industrystandard guideline,
Significant changes in fair value measurements from period to period are evaluated for reasonablenessKey drivers of the changes are identified and assessed for reasonableness against relevant informationfrom independent sources, or internal sources if necessary and appropriate.

Determination of fair valueNon-current other receivables
The fair value as disclosed in the table above are based on significant unobservable inputs (Level 3) and havebeen calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows using rates currently available for instruments onwith similar terms, credit risk and remaining maturities.
Non-current loan to a subsidiary is repayable upon demand and is not expected to be repaid within the next 12months. As the timing of the future cash flows arising from this amount cannot be estimated reliably, the fairvalues of this amount cannot be reliably measured.

(a)
Interest rate risk
