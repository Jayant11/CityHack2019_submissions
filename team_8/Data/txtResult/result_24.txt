CHAIRMAN'S STATEMENT 7 2017Review
2017 remained a year of challenge and change forKrisEnergy. Upstream companies, as well as theoffshore, marine and service sectors, had taken apummelling since the oil price downturn in 2014,and many a balance sheet was left enfeehled andinvestor confidence severely weakened.
Energy commodity markets have improved somewhat Global benchmarkBrent crude futures averaged US$54.75/bbl for 2017. a 21.3% increase fromthe previousyear‘s average when we witnessed spot levels below US$28.0/bbl. However, in the first quarter of2018 the Brent crude market hastradedbetween US$80.00/bbl and USS70,00/bbl‘ and despite the improvementswe remain exceedingly cautious and we continue to take a conservativepath when it comesto cash flow and capital expenditure going forward.
Our financial restructuring at the beginning of 2017 extended our debtmaturities and brought some fresh funds into the Company throughthe issuance of zero coupon notes With warrants. This restructuringrequired the support of holders of KrisEnergy equity and debt securitiesand I would like to offer my sincere appreciation to all investors for theircontribution in what was a sophisticated and interlinked process
PORTFOLIO REBALANCINE
As stated at the time of the restructuring, there was a need to adjust theoperational business model as part of the process, Initiatives to reach ourtargets have been taken throughout the year and will continue in 2018,
One key element was the maXimisation of existing production streamsand we have benefitted from essential infill drilling campaigns in all ourproducing assets in Bangladesh and in the Gulf ofThailand. Infill drillingis in the normal course of business for Gulf of Thailand fietds wherestacked reservoirs are faulted or eompartmentalised: drilling will maintainproduction levels and add to cash flow going forward if oil markets arestable.
We have rebalanced specific areas of the portfolio to prioritise capitalexpenditure to our core focus areas — existing producing assets and oildevelopments offshoreThailand and Cambodia.
As a result. we have relinquished three less mature assets in Indonesia andVietnam. In the fourth quarter of 2017, we also took the decision to ceaseparticipation in the Block A Aceh P50 and the associated gas development,The development is highly capital intenswe over several years and thisdecision reduces our exposure to development risks that have emergedand alleviates pressure on our capital resources. which will he directedto our lowerrcost and higher product value oil developments in the Gulf ofThailand.
DOST MANAGEMENT
Operating expenses for 20i7 have remained relatively flat at US$823mitlionand corporategeneraland administrative :ostscontinued to reduce,down byBB‘BD/ofrom 20iB, Cost managementisanotherfocusarea althoughwe recognise that certain expensesare fixed in nature and there must be nocompromise in our actions and systems regarding environmental‘ health,safety and security (“EH58).
The KrisEnergyteam recorded a solid performanceacross all EHSS areas inthe pastyear. TheGroup recorded 1587,18] man-hours on operated assets in2017 with zero lost time injuries (“LTIs”). Unfortunately after 1,014 workingdays without an LTI‘ one offshore personnel received an injury requiringhospital treatment in March 2018 during a regular maintenance procedure.The injured person received treatment and is expected to return to work
11
on the next crew change rotation, The inmdent was immediately reportedto our partner and the government regulatory body. A full investigationis underway and all necessary measures witl be implemented as soon aspossible to mitigate againstfurther such incidents
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
As companies evolve there are natural changes to management anddirectors as strategies refocus.
We welcomed Kelvm Tang to the position of Chief Executive Officer as ofi September 20i7. Kelvin joined KrisEnergy at its inception in 2009, andas General Counsel, he was closely aligned with all work streams withinthe Group. Kelvin directed the negotiations with the various governmentauthorities in Cambodia to Sign the restated petroleum agreement andthe production permit for the Apsara oil development. an outcome thatforms a key element in our strategy going forward. We are benefittingfrom his excellent leadership in steering the Company through the ongoingchallenges
Kelvin was also appointed as Executive Director to the Board in November20i7 along with Kiran Raj, our Chief Financial Officer. who was in turnappointed as Kelvm‘s Alternate Executive Director‘ These positions Willprovide consistency between management and the Board.
I would also like to welcome Chris Dng Leng Yeow, Chief Executive Officerof Keppel Offshore & Marine Ltd, who joined KrisEnergy's Board as Non-exeeutive Director effective 5 January 2018. Chris is a Chartered Engineerwith almost two decades of experience in the offshore and marine sectorand he brings a wealth of experience at a time when we are focused ondevelopment projects.
Associated with these changes‘ I would to thank and acknowledgecontributions made by Jeffrey MacDonald, who stepped down from hisposition of Interim Chief Executive Officer and Executive Director inAugust 20i7, and Michael Chia for his tenure as Nonrexecutive DirectoruntilJanuary 20i8.
WORKING WITHIN BUR MEANS
It remains paramount for us to maintain rigorous discipline in our activitieswithin funding and cash flow constraints, Our intent to derive additionalfinancmg from asset divestment/farm-out has proved challengingdespite vigorous efforts‘ primarily a consequence of oil price volatility andreduced access to traditional capital sources. We continue discussions,notwithstanding prevailing uncertainties, and we are exploring channelsto alternative and innovative funding solutions to alleviate immediatecapital requirements while progressing projects to meet ourtimelines,
KrisEnergy is a team of capable professmnals‘ who are very committed todehven
| wish to thank all stakeholders. our partners, contractors and theKrisEnergy community for the support and encouragement we havereceived‘andcontinuetoreceive.aswegoforthtocharterthesechallengingwaters.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER'S MESSAGE 7 2017Review
Although we welcomed the steady improvement inoil prices throughout 2017, the markets‘ gyrations inthefirstquarterof2018continuedtotestconfidencein the upstream sector and management‘s abilityto plan and commit to capital expenditure. In thisuncertain environment, our priorities will be tosafeguard our balance sheet through cost control,focus our capital resources towards committedand/or contractual expenditures, specifically onour development projects. whilst maximising oiland gas production.
With that in mind,we havecuntinuedthe portfolio managementprocess andas a result we decided in the fourth quarter of 2017 to cease participation inthe Block A Aceh gas project in Indonesia, thereby reducing the Group's riskexposure. The financial impact in 2017 ufthe Block A Aceh cessation was anbn-cash impairment of US$120] miliion, which was a primary contributorto the Group's net loss after tax of 0551392 million. An additionai writedown was taken for the Kutai PSC. which we relinquished in 2017 followingthe expiration of the licence and as part of a management review of nonrcure assets.
ADVANCES MADE
Our financial and operational resources in 2018 and 2019 will be directedtowards core Cambodian and Thai assets in the Gulf of Thailand whereour oil development projects have shorter cycie times to begin cash flowgeneration‘ and mandatory commitment activities as required under ourlicence agreements. Projects have been progressing within ourconstraihedmeans.
It was exceedingly satisfying to sign the petroleum agreement and prayduction permit for Cambodia Block A and the Apsara oil field developmentin August 2017. The formalisation of the agreements. together with oursubsequent declaration of final investment decision, have significantlyde-riskedtheApsara prujectand wewererewardedwiththereclassificationqupsara contingent resources to proved plus probable reserves.
The Cambodian authorities have been tremendouslysupportive and wecoh-tinue to cooperate closely as Apsara operations advance. We are honouredto bespearheading theApsara development, which is a majoreiement in ourfuture growth and we believe we remain on track to deliverfirst oii in 2019.
Infill drilling was undertaken in all our producing assets in 2017 to maintainor increase production rates. This was of particular significance in theWassana oil fieid in the Gulf of Thailand where for the last 12 months wehad encountered mechanicai issues in certain deviated wells that led to asharp drop in productivity. Six horizontal infill wells were completed andprogressively put on stream in Wassana since December 2017 providing animmediate uplift in production. which we expect to rise to around 6,000 to7,000 barrels ofoil per day (“bond) onceflow rates are optimised.
In addition, we had success in March 2018 with the Wassanarli appraisalweil and the associated sidetraek well in the vicinity of the Wassanafield. Preliminary results from these wells indicate that the Wassanasatellite area is an economically viabie commercial development in the010/413 licence. Development of the Wassana sateilite‘ which wouid betied back to the existing facilities, would reduce unit lifting costs on a perbarrel basis,
13

CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
We continue to discuss opportunities to farmrdown assets where we havea high working interest 7 Cambodia Block A and [310/48 , in parallel withexpioring financing solutions to attract maximum valuations With thecontinued uncertainty over oil markets it is prudent to reduce our risk— both technical and commercial e by way of farm—uut, which will aisopartialiy mitigate capital expenditure to our baiahce sheet.
Farm-uut discussions have been hampered for at least the last 24 monthslargely due to turbulent uii markets. which have impacted vaiuatinnsas well as access to financing. Stress tests on our developments undermultiple oil price scenarios indicatethatcurrent market valuations supportfullcommercialdevelupment.
BRIGHT DEMAND FDREBASTS
As well as the somewhat tentative improvement in oil prices, the macropicture for oil and gas, particularly in Asia, appears positive. Asia is widelypredicted by research bodies and think—tanks to be the driver of globalenergy demand growth in the coming decades through economic andpopulation expansion and urbanisation. Although various energy sourceswilicontribute tofiiithe increase in consumption, fossilfuels willcuntinueto playa primary role to ensure consistent, secure and affordabie supplies.
I would like to thank our shareholders, noteholders. banks and ourcolleagues in the offshore and marine sector for their support throughout2017 as we have repositioned and to some extent‘ highrgraded the portfoiioto bettermanage uurresourcesgoing forward. I am also profoundlygratefulforthe advice, support and encouragementfrom our Board of Directorsandmy eulieaguesin KrisEhergy,
While there remain many hurdles ahead, we are committed to rebuiidingKrisEnergy into a sustainable upstream oil and gas company.

ANTl—CURRUFTIDN
The KrisEnergy Group, with our operations across different geographiesand our engagement with numerous contractors, consultants, suppliers,joint-venture participants and agents, has multiple vulnerable points whichexpose us to risks of corruption. Preventing and managing risks associatedwith corrupt practices across KrisEnergy's operations is a key concern to ourstakeholders.
We manage this risk through maintaining our commitment to high standardsof ethical behaviour and actively ensuring that the Group's zeroitulerancepolicy towards Corruption, bribery and unethicalactiuns is strictly observed.Our core approach is to enable all personnel to make informed businesschoices that avoid all forms of breach and thereby protect the value of ourbusiness.
Our policy to prevent improper payments is constantly reinforced in respectof giving or receiving gifts, and dealing with entertainment, sponsorshipsand charitable contributions. In conjunction with this, we have in placequestionnairestoassistin duediligenceinrespectafnurthird-partycontracts.
126

As part of bur commitment to improve the lives of communities: we seekways to improve marginalised and underprivileged locals, In Sihanuukville,Cambodia, we work to empower local women through our StrengtheningWomen Entrepreneurs (“SWE”) program. We developed women's self-helpgroups across Sihanoukville municipality, Steunghav and Prey Nub districts.where only setfrmotivated women are identified to form villagerbasedWomen's Empowerment Groups (“WEGs”).
These groups build financial savings over time. provide low interest loans.and reward dividends to their members. KrisEnergy plays a vital role intraining these WEGs in growing their literacy, numeracy, leadership, financtalmanagement and entrepreneurial skills. Groups are administered by anelected managementcnmmittee consisting ofthewumen entrepreneurswhoelect rules for their groups and are also trained by KrisEnergy.
For the year 2017, we have a total of 20 WEGs and 500 women participating.They have accumulated a total of US$lB7JZ4 in savings.
We conduct monitoring programs to our existing Corporate SocialResponsibility (“CSR”) programs tn gather the necessary feedback forimprovement. This allows monitoring of trends, measure changes andcaptures knowledge to improve prugrams' performance and increasetransparency. Therefore, ensuring our programs are sustainabte, makesa difference in the lives of the community. The aim is to assess effects andprogress in terms of advances towards the generation of public proceduresandtrainingsandimprovementsinpeopte'sLivelihood‘focusingonprugrammeuutcumesandnotjustactivities.
We intend to continue building on our current programs. monitor ourperformance and to branch out into new areas not extensively coveredpreviously, specifically in Cambodia.

CHIEF FINANCiAL OFFICER 7 2017 FinancialReview
Entering 2017, we set out to execute several corporateand asset—related milestones, including:
- the restructuring and exchange of the $5130 miilion senior unsecurednotes due 2017 (the 2017 Notes) to the 55130 million senior unsecurednotes due 2022 (the “2022 Notes):
- the restructuring and exchange of the $5200 million senior unsecurednotes due 2018 (the “2018 Notes) to the $5200 million senior unsecurednotes due 2023 (the 2023 Notes);
- the preferentiat offering ofsenior secured zero coupon notes due 2024(“2024 ZCNs“ and together with the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notes,the “Notes) With detachabte warrants (the Wairants) to raise55139.5 million;
- farm-0ut/divestmeht/ielinquishmeht of certain assets to partialiymitigate portfoliuandtinancialrisk;
' maximising Group production and cost efficiencies, as well as curtailingcapital expenditure to committed capital expenditure: and
~ high grading the Group's development assets.
We successfuily exchanged and issued the 2022 Notes and the 2023 Notesin January 2017 and subsequently raised US$968 mitliun from the issue ofthe 2024 ZCNs with Warrants in February 2017.
We completed the farmrout 0f the Block A Aceh P50 and subsequenttymade the decision to cease participation in this gas development owingto the increasing risk exposure to the Group. Although it was our intentionto farm down working interests in other development blocks. mismatchesin valuations ted to the strategic decision to defer the farmrout process infurtherance of enhancing the overall net presentvalue ofour interests.
The macroeconomic environment, as it impacted the upstream oil and gasindustry, continued to remain volatile. As a consequence, we maintainedour Vigilance on cost nontrut and further reduced Group general andadministrative expenses: we continued to curtail capital expenditures tofocuson committed contracted expendituresin orderto protectthe Group'sfinancial performance and position; and we completed an infiii well in theBahgora gasfield in Bangladesh and we entered into infilidriiling programsin each of the 88/32. 010/46 and 011/46 concessions in the Gulf of Thailandto maintain ahd/ur rerestabtish production rates and maximise productionefficiencies.
We also made progress in thefuture commercialisation of ourdevelopmentassets in the Gulf of Thailand, where today, we are attracting significantattention from global fabrication and construction parties, drilling rig andoffshore support service providers and international crude oil offrtakers aswe strive to deliver ﬁrst 011 in the Kingdom of Cambodia in 2019.

We entered 2017 with lower carrying vatues for the Group's Oil &Gas Properties Assets and Exploration, Evaluation & Appraisat Assets dueto the incurrence of impairment charges in 2016 (“FY2016). As a resutt, andcoupled with lower Group production in 2017, DD&A amounted to US$483million (FY2016: 035104.13 mitiion).
Operating costs were ﬂat year~on~year at US$823 million in 2017 (FV2016:US$818 million). The Group's operating costs associated with piodumngassets are generally fixed in nature. Given lower production recorded in2017 and relatively ftat operating costs, Group lifting costs increased 27.7%to US$17.69 per harreluf nil equivatent (“hoe)compared with US$13 85/boein 2016.
The higher average reaiised crude price in Thailand in 2017 was offset bylower Wassana oii sates, which resulted in Thailand petroleum royattiespaid remaining flat at US$112 million year-on-year. We also incurred US$24million write down in crude oit inventories in 2017.

2018 FINANCIAL OUTLOOK
The Group‘s financial focus in 2018 will be to maximise cash flow from (1)expected incremental production from the Wassaha field in the 010/48concession and (ii) improvement in reatised uit pricing for Wassana crudeoil as we enter into a new oneryear sates contractcummencing1May 2018.The price differential against the Dubai crude behchmarkw1ll improve bymore than 50.0%.
We were encouraged by the successful WassanaVA appraisai welt drilledand completed in March 2018. which we believe witl provide vaiuable datato approve and sanction the deveiopmeht of the Wassana sateltite fietdin the vicinity of the existing Wassaha pruductionfa01t1ties.The satettitedevelopment witt be tied back to the existing Wassana facilities. therebysharing operating costs. The increased production from the uverattWassana devetopmentwill result in a reduction in lifting costs.
Foitowing significant progress made in the Cambodia Biock A developmentin 2017. we are in the process of selecting preferred bidders furthe ApsaraPhase 1A platform construction and instatlation. as wett as the prowsinnof drilling and support services. We intend to imptement fultyrintegrateddevelopment funding solutions to improve project returns for the Apsaraoil field as well as to preserve the Group's cash position. High grading ofCambodia Block A is critical to KrisEnergy's strategy as we remain firm inour commitmenttb deliver first bit to the Kingdom of Cambodia m 2019.
In addition to Cambodia Block A and the Wassana satellite. we wilicontinueto work with our juint-vehture partners to progress other developmentassets, namely the Rossukon oilfietd in 86/48 inthe GulfbfThailand and theLehgo gas field in the Butu PSC offshore EastJava.|nd0nesia.0ur1hteht10his to continue developing both Rossukon and Lengo projects so as to beabie to consider finai investment decision sometime at the end of 2018 orearly 2019.
Baiance sheet management remains criticat to the financial and riskmanagement of the Group. 0n 8 January 2018. we made a votuntaryanhouncemehtregardingthedivestmentuthuldingsbyKrisEnerngotdihgsLtd. a special purpose vehicle whotlyrowned by First Reserve Fund XII, LP.(“First Reserve) First Reserve duesnut inform the Board of Directors of itstradingandinvestmentratiunale.
We intend to continue to fund our operations through a combination of cashon hand, free cash fiow from operations. the Group‘s existing hank facilities.structured financing solutions for devetopment projects and potentially,proceeds from asset realisations. Today. the RCF has capacity to increaseto USS200.0 million and the upsize funds may be drawn on as and whenappropriate to provide additionalsources ofwarkihg capitat.
As we enter into2018, althoughvotatitity remains. we are encouraged by therecent rally in Brent benchmark pricing. In parallel with the high grading ofour assets. we intend to undertake farm out transactions to mitigate risk.We believe certain producing and developmentassetsshoutd be con51deredsignificant farm-uut prospects, espemalty those in which we hold highworking interests such as the 010/48 concession and Cambodia Block A.both in the GulfotThaitand.

THE PORTFOLIO
AS AT 1 APRIL 2018, KRISENERGY HELD WORKING INTERESTSIN 17 CONTRACT AREAS IN FIVE COUNTRIES
Our assets are largely in shallow waters in well-explured geological basins.We operate10 of our 17 assets. giving us control of the work programs andbudgetsand therefore theflexibility to optimise operations such asdrillingand seismic acquisition as well as the timing of expenditure.
We aim to balance our reserves, resources and production between oil andgas. Commercial nil discoveries are quickerto develop and sell into a readyinternationalspot market ata highervalue than the gas equivalent, butthelatter is generally sold in Asia under long-term supply contracts and is lessvulnerable to the volatility of global benchmark oil prices.
24
Our four producing assets — B8/32, Wassana in 610/48, Nong Yao in 611/48and Bangora in Block 9 — provide cash flow with which we plan to developour discoveries. Our development portfolio comprises the Apsara oil field inCambodia Black A. the Wassana satellite oil accumulation, the Rossukon oilfield in 66/48. all in the Gulf DfThailand: and the Lengn gasfield in the BuluPSC offshore East Java. in Indonesia.

TECHNICAL REVIEW

Operations in 2017 focused on producing assets tomaximise production and operational efficienciesas well as progressing development projects.
Infill drilling was undertaken in each of KrisEnergy‘s operated and non7operated producing assets in Bangladesh and the Gulf of Thailand, and theWassana-4appraisal and sidetrack well, drilled in March 2018, encounteredsufficient net oil pay to indicate a viable commercial satellite developmentin the 010/48 licence.
CONSTANT SAFETV REVIEW
The Group recorded 1,587,181 man-hours on its operated assets in 2017with zero LTIs as we continue to strive to implement best practice policiesfor EHSS across the organisatinn. In March 2018, after 1,014 workingdays without an LTI, one offshore personnel received an injury requiringhospital treatment during a regular maintenance procedure, The incidentwas immediately reported to our partner and the government regulatorybody. A full investigation is underway and all necessary measures will beimplemented assoon as possible to mitigate againstfurthersuch incidents.The injured party was treated and is expected to return to work on the nextcrew change rotation,
The Company maintained its OSHA518001 and 15014001 accreditation foroffices in Dhaka in Bangladesh, Jakarta in Indonesia and Singapore, as wellas the Bangora gas field operations in Block 9, onshore Bangladesh. Work isunderway to extend these accreditatiuns t0 KrisEnergy-operated fields inthe Gulf ofThailand.
RATIONALISATION
Three KrisEnergyeperated assets were relinquished 7 the Kutai and EastMuriah PSCs offshore Indonesia and Block105-110/04 offshore Vietnam 7following a review of non-core assets.
In addition, KrisEnergyfarmed down itsworking interestin the non700eratedBlock A Aceh PSC, onshore North Sumatra in Indonesia, from 41.BBBE% toresidual 15.0%. Subsequently, the Company decided in the fourth quarter2017 to cease participation in the Block A Aceh gas development to refocusthe Group's activities and capital resources to producing assets andoperated development projects in the Gulf of Thailand. The Company isawaiting approval from the Government of Indonesia for the takeover of itsentire15,0% working interest.

Working interest proved plus probable (”2P) reserves were estimated byNetherlahd. Sewell & Associates, Inc. (NSAI) at 83.5 million barrels of oilequivalent (“mmboe”) as at 31 December 2017 versus 96.6 mmboe as at 31December 2018, The majority of the decline 718.4 mmboe 7 resulted fromthe farm down 0fw0rking interest in the Block A Aceh PSC.
The reduction was partially offset by a reclassification to 2P reserves of8.1 million barrels of oil (“mmbo”) from contingent resources associatedwith Phase 1A of the Apsara oil development in Cambodia Block A. Thereclassification was a result of the signing in August 2017 of the amendedandrestated petroleumagreementforCambodia BlockAandtheproductiunpermitforthe Apsara development,
Minor reductions amounting to an aggregate 4.2 mmboe were recorded atthe B8/3201land gastields in the GulfofThailand and the Bangora gas fieldin Biuck 8. onshore Bangladesh. while there were gains totalling 1,4 mmboerelated to well performance and future drilling plans for the Wassana andNong Yaooilfieldsih 610/48 and 011/48. respectively. in the GulfofThailand.
NSAI recognised best estimate contingent(201resources of 87.3 mmboeas at 31 December 2017 versus 150.8 mmboe as at 31 December 2018.

The amended and restated petruteum agreement for Cambodia Block Aand the production permit for the Apsara oil development were signed on23 August 2017 between KrisEnergy, the Cambodian Ministry of Mines andEnergy and the Ministry of Economics and Finance.
The agreements triggered the second retinquishment phase of theconcession, whereby approximately 250% of the Cambodia Block A area,was returned to the authorities leaving 3,083 sq. km over the Khmer Basinin the Gulf of Thailand where water depths range between 50 metres and80 metres
KrisEnergy. the operator of the Cambodia Block A since 2014, plans todevelop the Apsara area in the north-eastern section of the concession,which 15 one of seven geological trends in the licence where there ispotentialtoroiland/orgasto be trapped.

The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historicalcost basis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below.
Historical cost isgeneratly based on the fairvalue 0fthe consideration given inexchange forgoodsand services.
Fair value is the price that would be received to seltan assetor paid to transfera liabitity in an orderly transaction between market participants at themeasurement date, regardiess of whether that price is directly observabieor estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair valueof an asset or a liability, the Group takes ihtn account the characteristicsat the asset or liability which market participants woutd take into accountwhen pricing the asset or liabihty at the measurement date. Fair value formeasurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financialstatements is determined on such a basis, except for sharerbased paymenttransactions that are Within the scope of IFRS 2 Share-based Payment,leasing transactions that are within the scope of IFRS i6 Leases, andmeasurements that have some similarities to fair vatue but are not fair valuesuch as netrealisable value in IASZ lnventuriesor value-in-use(“V|U) in IAS 36lmpairmentofAssets
in addition. for financial reporting purposes. fair value measurements arecategorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to thefair value measurements are observabte and the significance of the inputs tothe fairvatue measurement in its entirety‘ which aredescribed asfoltows:
a) Level] inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identicalassets or liabilitiesthatthe entity can access at the measurementdate‘
b) LevelZinputsareinputs,otherthanquotedpricesinciudedwithinLeveli,thatare observablefor the asset or habiiity, eitherdirectlyor indirectly;and
c) Level3 inputsare unobservabte ihputsfurthe assetorliability.
1.2 BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
The consolidated tinanciai statements comprise the financiai statementsof the Company and entities (including structured entities) controtled bythe Company and its subsidiaries as at 3] December 2017. The financialstatements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidatedfinancialstatementsare preparedfurthesamereportihg date asthe Company.Consistent accounting pelicies are applied to Like transactions and events insimilarcircumstances,
70
Control is achieved when the Company‘
- Has power overthe investee:
- Is exposed, or has the rights, to variabie return from its involvement With theinvestee; and
- Has the abitity to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee it facts andcircumstances indicate that there are changes to one or more of the threeetements ofcontrollisted above,
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee,
it has power overthe investeewhenthevoting rightsare sufficient to give it the
practicatabilitytu directthe relevantactivitiesofthe investee unilaterally.The
Cnmpany considersall relevantfactsand circumstances in assessing whether
or nutthe Company's voting rights in an investee are sufficient to give it power,
including:
- The sizeof the Company's holding ofvoting rights relativeto the sizeanddispersion of hotdings oi the othervote hotders;
- Potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or otherparties:
' Rights arising from othercontractual arrangements; and
- Any additionalfactsand uircumstancesthatindicatethatthe Company has,or does not have‘ the current ability to direct the relevant aotivxties at thetime that decisions need to he made‘ including voting patterns at previousshareholders’meetings.
All intrargruup balances. income and expenses and unreatised gains and lossesresulting from intra-grouptransaotions and dividends areeliminated in fuli.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date onwhich the Group obtains controt‘ and continueto be consolidated untilthe datewhen such controlceases.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the nunrcohtrulling interests evenitthatresultsinadeficitbalance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control,is accounted for as an equity transaction. If the Group loses control over asubsidiary, it:

- Recognises any surplus or deﬁcit in profit or loss: and
' Re-alassifies the Group's share of components previousiy recognisedin other comprehensive income to profit or loss or retained earnings. asappropriate.
2.3 CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICY AND DISCLOSURES
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previousﬂnanciai year except in the current financiai year, the Group has adopted allthe new and rewsed standards which are effective for annuai finanoial periodsbeginning on or after] January 20W. The adoption of these standards did nothave any material effect on the financiat performance or position ofthe Group,except for certain presentation improvements arising from Amendments toIAS 7 Statement ofL‘ash Flows: Disclosure Initiative.
The Group‘s Liabilities arising from financing activities and a reconciliationbetween theopening and closing batances 0ftheseliabilitiesare setuut in Note18. Consistent with the transition provisions of the amendments the Grouphas not disctosed comparative information for the prior period. Apart from theadditional disclosure in Note 18, the application ofthese amendments has hadno impacton the Group‘s consolidated financialstatements.

Management anticipates that the adoption of the above IFRSs. IFRICs andamendments to IFRS in future periods will not have a material impact on thefinanCial statements of the Group and 0f the Company in the period of theirinitialadoption exceptfurthefollowing:
IFRSIE LEASES
IFRS 16 introduces a comprehensive model for the identification of leasearrangements and accounting treatments for both lessors and lessees. IFRS18 will supersede the current lease guidance including IAS 17 Leases and therelated Interpretationswhen it becomes effective,
IFRS1Bdistinguishesleases and service contracts on the basis of whether anidentified asset is Cuntrolled by a customer. Distinctions of operating leases(off balance sheet) and finance leases (on balance sheet) are removed forlessee accounting, and is replaced by a model where a rightrofruse asset anda curresponding liability have to be recognised for all leases by lessees (i.e. allon balance sheet) except for shortterm leases and lease of low value assets.
The rightrufruseassetisinitially measured atcustand subsequently measuredat cost (subject to certain exception) less accumulated depreciation andimpairment losses, adjusted for any remeasurement 0f the lease liability, Thelease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease paymentsthat are not paid at that date. Subsequently, the lease liability is adjusted forinterest and lease payments, as well as the impact of lease modifications.amongst others. Furthermore, the classification of cash flows will also beaffected as operating lease payments under IAS 17 are presented as operatingcash flows; whereas under the IFRS 18 model‘ the lease payments will be splitinto a principaland an interest portion which will be presented as financing andoperating cash flows respectively.
In contrast tn lessee accounting. IFRS 16 substantially carries forward thelessor accounting requirements in IAS 17, and continues to require a lesser tnclaSSify a lease either as an operating lease or a finance lease.
Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by IFRS 16.
Management is currently assessmg the potential impact of the new IFRS 18. Itis not practicable to providea reasonable estimate 0fthe financial effect untilmanagement completes the review Management does not plan to early adoptthe newlFRSiB.
2.5 BUSINESS COMBINATION AND EODDWILL
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method.Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combinationare measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date, Acquisition»related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs areincurred andtheservices are received.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will berecognised at fair value atthe acquisition date. Subsequentchanges tn the fairvalueofthecontingentconSiderationwhichisdeemedtobeanasseturliability,willbe recognised in prufitnrloss.
The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non~controllinginterest in theacquiieeﬂfanytthatare present ownershipinterestsand entitle their holders to a proportionate share at net assets in the event ofliquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the noncontrolling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable netassets. Other components of nonrcontrulling interests are measured at theiracquisition date fair value, unless another measurement basis is required byanutherlFRS.
71
Any excess of the sum of the fair value Of the consideration transferred in thebusiness combination, the amount at nonrcontrulling interest in the achiree(it any), and the fair value of the Group's previously held equity interest in theacquiiee (if any), over the net fair value of the aequiree‘s identifiable assetsand liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In instances where the latter amountexceedsthetormer‘theexcess isrecognisedasexcessoffairvalueofnetassetsacquired overcunsideratiun paid in pmfit 0r lossunthe acquisition date.
GoodWill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill ismeasured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquned in a businesscombination is, from the acquisition date‘ allocated to the Group's cashgeneratingunitst“CGUslthatareexpectedtobenefitfromthesynergiesofthecombination, irrespective of whether otherassets or liabilities of the acquireeareaSSignedtothoseunits.
The CGUs to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairmentannually and whenever there is an indication that the CGU may be impaired.Impairment isdetermined fur goodwill by assessmg the recoverable amuunt ateach CGU (orgroupofCGUs) to which the goodwill relates.
Where goodWill forms part of a CGU and part of the operation within thatCGU is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of isincluded in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain orloss Un disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this Circumstance ismeasured based on the relative fairvalues 0fthe operations disposed ufand theportion of the CGU retained.
2.6 SUBSIDIARIES
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controlsan investee when it is exposed. or has rights, to variable returns from itsinvolvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returnsthrough its power over the investee.
In the Company'sseparatefinancialstatements‘ investment in subsidiariesaieaccounted for at cost less impairment losses.

2.8 FOREIGN CURRENCY
The financial statements are presented in USD, which is also the Company'sfunctional currency. Each entity in the Group determines its own functionalcurrency and items included in the financialstatementsofeach entityare measured using thatfunctional currency.
(I) TRANSACTIONS AND BALANCES
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functionatcurrencies of the Company and its subsidiaries and are recorded on initialrecognition inthefunctionalcurrenciesatexchangerates approXimatingthoseruting at the transaction dates.

PRE-lICENBE COSTSPre-iicence costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred.
LICENCE AND PROPERTY ACQUISITION BDSTS
Exptoration licence and leasehold property acquisition costs are capitalised asintangible assets
Licence and property acquisition costs are reviewed at each reporting dateto confirm that there is no indication that the carrying amount exceeds therecoverable amount, This review includes confirming that expioration driliing isstitl under way orfirmly planned‘ or that it has been determined, or work is underway to determine that the discovery is economically viable based on a range oftechnicai and commerCial considerations and suffiCient progress is being madeon establishing development plans and timing.
if no future activity is planned orthe Licence has been relinquished or has expired,the carrying amount of the Licence and property acquisition costs is written offthrough profit or toss. Upon production ottirst gas or oil. the relevant expenditureis transferred to oil and gas properties.
72
EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION COSTS
Exploration and evaluation actiVity involves the search for hydrocarbon resources,the determination of technical feasibility and the assessment of commercialViability of an identified resource.
Once the legal right to explore has been acquired, costs directty associated withan exploration wellare capitalised as exptoration and evaluation intangibleassetsuntil the drilling of the well is completed and the results have been evaluated.These costs inctude directly attributable employee remu neration, materials andfuel used‘ rig costs and payments made to contractors.
If no potentially commercial hydrocarbons are discovered and evaluated resultsare not used in assessing the commerciality of the asset, the exptoration andevaluation asset is written off through profit or loss as a dry hote expense. ifextractable hydrocarbons are found and, subject to further appraisal activity(eg the drilting of additional wetls), it is probabte they can be commerciallydeveloped, the costs continue to be carried as an intangible asset while sufficient/continued progress is made in assessing the commerciaiity of the hydrocarbons,Costs directly associated with appraisal actiVity undertaken to determine thesize, characteristics and commercial potential of a reservoir foltowing theinitial discovery of hydrocarbons, inciuding the costs of appraisal weils wherehydrocarbons were not found, are initially capitalised as an intangibte asset.
Atl such capitalised costs are subject to technicat, commercial and managementreview, as weli as review for indicators of impairment at Least once a year. This isto conﬁrm the continued intent to develop or otherwise extract value from thediscovery. When this is no longer the case, the costs are written off through profitor loss.
Upon production of first gas or oil, the relevant capitalised expenditure is firstassessed for impairment and (if required) any impairment loss is recognised, thenthe remaining balance is transferred to oil and gas properties.
FARM-OUTS - IN THE EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION PHASE
The Group does not record any expenditure made by the farmee on its account. Itatso does not recognise any gain or loss on its exptoration and evaluation farm-outarrangements but redesignates any costs previously capitatised in retation to thewhole interest as relating to the partial interest retained, Any cash conSiderationreceived directty from the farmee is credited against costs previously capitalisedin reiatiun to the whole interest with any excess accounted for by the farmoras again on disposal. The Group wili test the retained interests for impairment if theterms of the arrangement indicate that the retained interest may be impaired.
DEVELOPMENT COSTS
Expenditure on the construction, instaltation or completion of infrastructurefacilities such as ptatforms, pipelines and the drilling of devetopment wetls,inciuding unsuccessful development on delineation wetls, is capitalised withinexploration and evaluation assets, as management betieves there are futureeconomic benefits to be obtained for otherwells.
2.1!] IJIL AND GAS PROPERTIES AND OTHER PROPERTY, PLANT ANDEUUIPMENT
INITIAL RECOGNITION
Oil and gas properties and other property, plant and equipment are initiallyrecorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, other property, ptant and equipmentare measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulatedimpairment losses.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price orconstruction cost, anycosts directly attributable to bringing the asset into operation, the initial estimateof the decommissioning obligation, and for qualifying assets (where relevant),borrowing costs. The purchase price or construction cost isthe aggregate amountpaid and the fair value of any other consideration given to acquire the asset. Thecapitalised value of a finance lease is also included within property, ptant andequipment.
Whenadevelopmentprojectmovesintotheproductionstage.thecapitalisationof certain constructiun/development costs ceases and costs are eitherregarded as part of the cost of inventory or expensed, except for costs whichquatify for capitalisation relating to oil and gas properties asset additions,improvements ornewdevelopments.

The assets' residual values‘ useful lives and methods of depreciation.depletionand amortisation are reviewed ateach reporting period,and adjustedprospectively,ifapprupriate.
FARM-UUTS - OUTSIDE THE EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION PHASE
In accounting for a farm-out arrangement outside the exploration andevaluation phase.theGr0up:
- De-recognises the proportion oftheasset that it has sold tothefarmee;
- Recognisesthe consideration received nrreceivable from theiarmee, whichrepresents the cash received and/or the farmee‘s obligation to fund thecapitalexpenditure in relatiuntu the interestretained bythefarmor;
- Recognises a gain or loss on the transaction for the difference betweenthe net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset disposedof.

The consideration receivable on disposal of an item of property. plant andequipment or an intangible asset is recognised initially at its fair value by theGroup. However, if paymentfurthe item is deferred,the consideration receivedis recognised initially at the cash price equivalent, The difference betweenthe nominal amount of the consideration and the cash price equivalent isrecognised as interest revenue.

All other day-tu-day repairs and maintenance costs are expensedas incurred.

2. INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost, Followinginitial acquisition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any accumulatedamortisation and any accumulated impairment lusses Internally generatedintangibleassets, excluding capitalised developmentcosts‘ are nutcapitalisedand expenditure is reflected in profit or loss in the year in which the expenditureisincurred.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as eitherfinite 0r indefinite
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amnrtised over the estimated usefullives and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that theintangible asset may be impaired‘ The amortisation period and the amortisationmethod are reViewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expecteduseful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future economic benefitsembodied in the asset is accounted for by changing the amortisation period ormethod, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets With indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are testedfor impairment annually. or more frequently if the events and circumstancesindicate that the carrying amount may be impaired either individually or atthe CGU level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of anintangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determinewhetherthe useful life assessment continues to be supportable. If not, the changein useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured asthe difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of theasset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset is de-recugnised.
2.12 IMPAIRMENT 0F NDN-FINANCIAI. ASSETS
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indicationthat an asset (or CGU) may be impaired‘ CGU is the smallest group ofassetsthat independently generates cash flow and whose cash flows is largelyindependent of the cash flows generated by other assets, which include oiland gas properties. other property, plant and equipment, goodwill and otherintangibleassets.Ifanyindicatiunexists,urwhen anannualimpairmenttestingfor an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset‘s 0r CGU'srecoverableamount.

Where thecarrying amount at an assetanGUexceedsits recoverableamount,theasset isconsidered impaired and iswrittendown to its recoverable amount.
In calculating VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to theirpresent value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current marketassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asseturCGU. The Group bases its impairment calculation on detailed budgets andforecasts, which are prepared separately for each of the Group's CGU to whichthe individual assets are allocated. These budgets and forecasts generallycover the period up to the end of Oil and gasfield's economic life. VIU does notreflect future cash flows associated with improving or enhancing an asset'sperformance,
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been achange in the estimates used to determine the asset's recoverable amountsince the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carryingamount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increasecannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined‘ net ofdepreCiation, had no impairmentluss been recognised previuusly.$uch reversalis recognised in profitorloss.

“3 FINANCIALINSTRUMENTS2.l3.l FINANCIAL ASSETSINITIAL RECOGNITION Mil] MEASUREMENT
Financial assets are recognised when. and only when. the Group becomes aparty to the contractual provtsmns 0f the financial instrument. The Groupdeterminesthe classification utitsfinancialassetsatinitialrecognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially. they are measured at fair value.ptus, in the case of hnanciat assets not at fair value through profit or loss,directly attributable transaction costs.
SUBSEOUENT MEASUREMENT
The subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on theirclassification. as follows:
FINANCIAL ASSETS AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PROFIT OR LOSS
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss include financial assetsheld for trading. Financial assets are classified as heid fortrading if they areacquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasing in the near term. Thiscategory includes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group.Derivatives, inctuding separated embedded derivatives are atso classified asheldfortrading.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profitor loss are measured at fair value. Any gains or tosses arising from changes infairvalue nfthefihancial assetsare recognised in pmfitnrlnss. Net gains urnetlosses on financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss inctude exchangedifferences, interestand diwdendihcome.
LOANS AND RECEIVABLES
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments thatare not quoted in an active market are classified as loans and receivables.Subsequent to initiat recognition, lnans and receivables are measured atamurtised cost using the effectiveinterest method‘ tessimpairment. Gains andlosses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are de»recognised urimpaired, and thmugh theamortisatiun process.
The Group has not designated any finanmal asset upon initial recognition asheld»to»maturity investments oravaitable»t0r»satefinancial assets.
DE-RECDBNITION
A ﬁnanciat asset (or, where applicable a part of a financial asset or part of agroup ufstmilarfihancialassets) isde-recognised when:
- The Group transfers the contractual rights to receivethe cash ttows 0fthefinancialassetmr

Where the Group has transferred its rights to receive cash flows from an assetand has neither transferred nor retained su bstantially all the risksand rewardsof the asset nor transferred control of the asset, the asset is recognised tnthe extent at the Group's continuing involvement in the asset. Continuinginvolvement that takes the form at a guarantee over the transferred asset,iS measured at the lower of the original carrying amount of the asset and themaximum amount of consideratiunthat the Group could be required to repay.

Itthereisobjectiveevidencethatanimpairmentlossonfinancialassetscarriedat amortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured asthe difference between the assets carrying amount and the present valueof estimated future cash flows discounted at the financiat asset‘s originaleffective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount ratefor measuring any impairment toss is the current effective interest rate. Thecarrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowanceaccount.The impairment toss is recognised in profit or loss.

If in a subsequent period. the amount of the impairment tossdecreases and thedecrease can be related objectively toah event occurring after the impairmentwas recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to theextentthatthe carryingamountoftheassetdoesnotexceeditsamurtisedcostat the reversat date. The amou nt of reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
2.13.2 EOUITVINSTRUMENTS
Ah equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in theassets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. Equity instruments arerecorded atthe proceeds received. netufdirect issue costs.
WARRANTS
Detachabie warrants issued are classified as equity. Warrants are measuredatfairvatue at the date of grant and the proceeds are apportioned towarrantsusing the relative tairvalue approach.
2.13.3 FINANCIAL LIABILITIESINITIAL RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT
Finanmal liabilities are recognised when, and onty when, the Group becomesa party to the contractual provisions at the financial instrument. The Groupdetermines the classification ofitsfinanciat Liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial Liabilities are recognised initially at fair value ptus in the case oftinanciat liabitities hot at fair value through profit or loss‘ directly attributabletransactioncosts.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES AT FAIR VALUE THROUGH PRUFIT OR LOSS
Financxal liabilities at fair vatue through profit or loss include financialliabilities hetd for trading. Financiai liabitities are classified as held fortradihgif they are acquired for the purpose of selling in the near term. This categoryincludes derivative financial instruments entered into by the Group that arenot designated as hedging instruments in hedge retatiunships. Separatedembedded derivatives are also classified as held for trading unless they aredesignated as effective hedging instruments.

FINANCIAL “ABILITIES CARRIED AT AMORTISED BUST
Financial Liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss aresubsequently measured at amortised cost usmg the effective interest method.Gains and losses are recognised in profit or toss when the liabilities are de-recognised‘ and through the amortisation process.
DE-REBOGNITIDN
A financiat liability is derrecognised when the obligation under the liabilityis discharged or cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability isreplaced by another from the same lender on substantiatly different terms. orthe terms of an existing liability are substantially modiﬁed‘ such an exchangeor modification is treated as a derrecognition of the original liabitity and therecognition of a new liability. and the difference in the respective carryingamounts is recog nised in profit or loss.
2.l3.4 EMBEDDED DERIVATIVES
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contractsare treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are notclosely related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts are notmeasured at fairvalue with changes in fair vatue recognised in profit or toss
An embedded derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-currentliability if the remaining maturity of the hybrid instrument to which theembedded derivative relates is more than i2 months and it isnotexpected to berealised orsettled withilemonths.Otherembeddedderivatives are presentedas current assetsorcurrentliabilities.
“3.5 OFFSETTING OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Financial assets and financiat Liabilities are offset and the net amount isreported in the statement offinancial position ifthere isa currentty enforceablelegal rightto offset the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settleon a net basis, to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
LII. EASII AMI] EASII EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivatents comprise cash at bank and on handi and short-termdeposits which are subjectto insignificant risk of changes in value.

Net realisable value is the estimatedselling price in the ordinary course of busmess, less estimated costs ofcompletion and the estimated costs necessary to make thesate,
2.I8 LEASES
Operating lease payments are recognised as an operating expense in profit orloss on a straightvline basis uverthe lease term.
2. PROVISIONSGENERAL
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legator constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outflow ofresourcesembodyingeconomic benefitswill be required tosettletheobligationahdthe amountofthe obligation can be estimatedreliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adJListed toreflect the current best estimate, If it is no longer probable that an outflowof economic resources witl be required to settte the obligation, the provisionis reversed, If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions arediscounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects where appropriate, therisks specific to the liability. When discounting is used. the increase in theprovision dueto the passage oftime is recognised asa finance cost.
75
DECOMMISSIONING LIABILITY
The obligation generally arises when the asset is installed or the ground/environment is disturbed at the field location. When the liability is initiallyrecognised,the presentvalueoftheestimatedcostsiscapitalised byincreasingthe carrying amount of the related oil and gas assets to the extent that it wasincurred by the development/cunstruction of the field. Any decommissioningobligations that arise through the production of inventory are expensed whenthe inventory item is recognised in cost of goodssold.
Changes in the estimated timing of decommissioning or changes to thedecommissioning cost estimates are deatt with prospectively by recording anadjustment to the provision. and a corresponding adjustment to oil and gasassets.
Any reduction in the decommissioning liabitity and‘ therefore. any deductionfrom the asset to which it relates, may not exceed the carrying amount of thatasset If it does‘ any excess over the carrying amount is taken immediately toprofit or loss.
If the change in estimate results in an increase in the decommissioning liabilityand, therefore, an addition to the carrying amount of the asset‘ the Groupconsiders whether this is an indication of impairment of the asset as a whole,and if so, tests for impairment in accordance with IAS 36. If, for mature fields,the estimate for the revised value of oiland gasassets net of decommissmningprovisionsexceedtherecoverabtevatue‘thatportion oftheincreaseis chargeddirectlyto expense.
Over time, the discount liability is increased for the change in present valuebased on the discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments andthe risks specific to the liabitity. The periodic unwinding of the discount isrecognised in protitcrlcss asa finance cost.
2.]! HEDGE ACCOUNTING
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain hedging relationships whichqualityforhedge accounting.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedgesare classified as fairvalue hedgeswhen hedging the exposure to changes in the fairvalue ofa recognised asset orliabilityoranunrecognisedfirm commitments
At the inception of a hedging relationship, the Group formally designates anddocuments the hedging relationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedgeaccounting and the risk management objective and strategy for undertakingthe hedge
The documentation includes identification of the hedging instrument, thehedged item or transaction the nature of the risk being hedged and how theentity will assess the effectiveness of changes in the hedging instrument'sfair value in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedged item's fair valueorcash flows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to behighly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fairvalue or cash flows andare assessed on an ongoing basis to determine that they actually have beenhighly effective throughoutthe financiat reporting periods forwhich they weredesignated,
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted forastollows:
FAIR VALUE IIEIJGES
The change in thefairvatueofa hedging derivativeisrecognised in profitorlossin other operating expenses. The change in the fair value of the hedged itemattributable to the risk hedged is recorded as a part of the carrying amountof the hedged item and is also recognised in profit or loss in other operatingexpenses.
Forfairvaluehedgesrelatingtoitemscarriedatamortisedcost,theadjustmentto carrying amount is amortised through proﬁt or loss over the remainingterm of the hedge using the effective interest method, Effective interest rateamortisation may beginassoon asan adjustmentexistsand no laterthanwhenthe hedged item ceases to be adjusted fnrchanges in itstairvalue attributabteto the risk being hedged.

in 2016, the Group had cross currency swaps that were used as hedges tor theexposure ofchanges in the fair vatue of its Multircurrency medium term notes.Theswaps wereterminated in 2017 See Note 22fur mute details.
2.]! REVENUE RECOGNITION
Revenue is recognised t0 the extent that it is probable that the economicbenefits wilt flow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured,regardless ofwhen the payment is made. Revenue is measured atthe fairvalueof consideration received or receivable, taking into account cuntractuatlydefinedterms ofpaymentand excludingtaxes arduty.
Revenue from the sale at oil and gas is recognised when the signiﬁcant risksand rewards of ownership have been transferred. which iS considered to occurwhen title passes to the customer. This generally occurs when the product isphysicaily transferred into a vessel, pipeorbtherdelivery mechanism.
Revenue from the production of mi, in which the Group has an interest withother producers, is recognised based on the Group's working interest and thetermsufthe relevantprnductiun sharing contracts.

DASH-SETTLED TRANSACTIONS
The cost of cash-settled transactions is measured initially at fair vatue atthe grant date using a binomial modet, further detaits at which are given inNote 21. This fair value iS expensed over the period untit the vesting datewith recognition of a corresponding liability. The liability is re-measured tofair value at each repurting date up to, and including the settlement date‘with changes in fairvalue recognised in employee benefits expense in Note2i.
(Ill DEFINED BENEFIT PLAN
The Gruupnperatesdetined benefit pension plansin IndonesiaandThailand.which are governed by the local labour Laws.

The net deﬁned benefit Liability 0r asset is the aggregate of the presentvalue 0fthe defined benefit obligations (derived using a discount rate basedon high qualitycorporate bonds) at the end of the reporting period reducedby the fair value of plan assets (if any) adjusted for any effect of limiting anetdefined benefit asset to the asset ceiling. If there is no deep market forhigh quality corporate bonds, the Group derives the discount rate basedon government bonds instead. The asset ceiting is the present value ofany economic benefits available in the form of refunds from the ptan nrreductions in future contributions to the plan.
The cost of providing benefits underthedefined benefit ptans is determinedseparatetyfureach plan using the projected unit credit method.
Defined benefit costs cumprisethetolluwing:
- Service cost
- Net interest onthe netdefined benefit liabitityorasset
- Re-measurements utnetdefined beneﬁt liabilityorasset
Service costs which include current service costs, past service costs andgains or tosses 0n non-routine settlements are recognised as expense inprofit or toss, Past service costs are recognised when plan amendment orcurtailment occurs.
Net interest on the net defined benefit liability or asset is the change duringthe period in the net deﬁned benefit liability or asset that arises from thepassage of time which is determined by applying the discount rate based onhigh quality government bonds to the net deﬁned benefit liability or asset.Net interest on the net defined benefit liabitity or asset is recognised asexpense orincomein prufiturloss.
Re-measurements comprising actuariat gains and losses, return on planassets and any change in the effect of the asset ceiling (excluding netinterest on defined benefit liabitity) are recognised immediately in othercomprehensive income in the period in which theyarise. Re-measurementsare recognised in retained earningswithin equityand are not reclassified toprofit or loss in subsequent periods,
Plan assets are assets that are held by a tongrterm employee benefitfund or qualifying insurance policies. Plan assets are not available tn thecreditors of the Group, norcan they be paid directly to the Group. Fair valueutplan assets isbased on marketprice information. When no marketprice isavaitable, the tairvalue of plan assets is estimated by discounting expectedfuture cash flows using a discount rate that reﬂects boththe risk associatedwith the plan assets and the maturity or expected dispusat date of thoseassets(or, it they have no maturity, the expected period until the setttementof the related obligation s).
The Gruup’srightto bereimbursed of some oratl of the expenditure requiredto settleadefined benefitobligation is recognised asaseparateasset atfairvalue when and onlywhen reimbursement isvirtuatly certain,
2.2l TAXESCURRENT TAX
Current tax assets and Liabilities forthe current and prior periods are measured atthe amount expected to be recovered from or paid to the taxation authorities Thetax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those that are enacted0r substantively enacted, at the reporting date in the countries where the Groupoperates and generates taxabie income.
Current taxes are recognised in profit and loss except to the extent that the taxrelates to items recognised outside profit or loss. either in ether cnmprehensiveincome or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positinnstaken inthe tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regutations aresubject to interpretations and establishes provisions where appropriate.
DEFERREDTAX
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences atthe end of the reporting period between the tax bases of assets and Liabilitiesandtheircarrying amountsfnrfinanciatreporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences,except:

RDVALTIES, RESOURCE RENT TAX AND REVENUE-BASED TAXES
In addition to corporate taxes, the Group's consolidated financial statements alsoinclude and recognise taxes on income, other type of taxes on net income whichare calculated based on oil and gas production.
Royalties, resource rent taxes and revenue—based taxes are accounted for underIAS 12 when they have the characteristics of an income tax. This is consideredto be the case when they are imposed under government tax authority and theamount payable is based on taxable income , rather than based on physicalquantity produced or as a percentage of revenue - afteradjustment for temporarydifferences. For such arrangements, current and deferred tax is provided on thesame basis as described above for other forms of taxation, Obligations arisingfrom royalty arrangements and other types of taxes that do not satisfy thesecriteria are recognised as current provisions and included in cost of sales.
PRODUCTIUN-SHARINE AGREEMENTS
According to the productionrsharihg agreements (“PSA”), the share of the profitoil to which the government is entitled in any calendar year, is deemed to includea portion representing the corporate income tax imposed upon and due by theGrou p. This amount will be paid directly by the government on behalf of the Groupto the appropriate tax authorities. This portion of tax and revenue are presentednet in profit or loss.
3| SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS, ESTIMATESAND ASSUMPTIONS
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requiresmanagement to make judgements. estimates and assumptions that affect thereported amounts of revenues expenses. assets and liabilities, and the disclosureof contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty abouttheseassumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a materialadjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the futureperiods.
77
3.] JUDGEMENTS MADE IN APPLYING AECIIIUNTING PIJLIBIES
In the process of applying the Group‘s accounting policies, management has madethe following judgements which have the most significant effect on the amountsrecognised in the consolidated financial statements:
HVDRDBARBUN RESERVE AND RESOURCE ESTIMATES
TheGroup has engaged an independentqualitied personto estimatethe proved,probable and possible reserves for certain of the Group's exploration andevaluation assets and oiland gas properties. and such reservesare determinedin accordance with Society of Petroleum Engineers’ rules and incorporatingthe estimated future cost of developing those reserves. The Group estimatesits commercial reserves based on information compiled by the independentqualified person and internal experts relating to the geological and technicaldata on the size, depth, shape and grade of the hydrocarbon body and suitableproductiohtechniquesahd recovery rates.
Recoverable reserves are determined by taking into conSideration, amongstother factors, future development costs. discount rates, operating costs,decommissioning costs. exploration potential. and future hydrocarbon prices,the latter haVing an impact onthe total amount of recoverable reserves and theproportion ofthe gross reserveswhieh are attributable to the host governmentunder the terms 0fthe PSA.
Future development costs are estimated using assumptions as to numberof wells required to produce the commercial reserves the cost of suchwells and associated production facilities and other capital costs. The oilprice assumption is derived based on the average forecast for Brent Crudefuture prices and adjusted for quality, transportation fees and regional pricedifferences. The Group's average forecast for Brent Crude future prices rangefrom USSBDto USSBU (2016: US$50 to US$85) perbarrel.
As the economic assumptions used may change and as additional geologicalinformation is obtained during the operation of an asset‘ estimates ofrecoverable reserves may change. Such changes may impact the Group'sreportedfinancialposition and results,includingamongstothers,onitemssuchas(i) impairment assessment otthe Group’s exploration and evaluation assets,oil and gas properties. and intangible assets: (ii) depreciation, depletion andamortisation charges: (iii) inventory cost; (vi) provisions for decommissioning;and iiv) deterred tax assets.

EXPLORATION AND EVALUATION EXPENDITURES
The application ufthe Group's accounting policyfor exploration and evaluationexpenditure requires judgement to determine whether it is likely that futureeconomic benefits are likely, eitherfrom future expluitation nrsale‘ orwhetheractivities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonable assessmentof the existence of reserves. The determination of reserves and resourcesis itself an estimation process that reqwres varying degrees of uncertaintydepending on how the resources are classified. These estimates directly impactwhen the Group defers exploration and evaluation expenditure The deferralpolicy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as tofuture events and circumstances in particular, whether an economical Viableextraction operation can he established. Any such estimates and assumptionsmay change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure iscapitalised, information becomes available suggesting thatthe recovery oftheexpenditureis unlikely.therelevantcapitalisedamuuhtis written ottin profiturloss in the period when the new information becomes available.
DEBUMMISSIONING COSTS
Decommissioning costs will be incurred by the Group at the end of theoperating life of some of the Group's facilities and properties. The ultimatedecommissioning costs are uncertain and cost estimates can vary in response tomany factors including changes to relevant legal requirements the emergence ofnew restoration techniques or experience at other production SitES‘ Consequently,the timing and amounts of future cash flows are subject to significant uncertainty,Changes in the expected future Gusts are reflected in both the prowsion and theasset and could have a material impact on the Group's financial statements,
The carrying amount of the Group's provision for decommissioning is disclosed inNotei9tu the financial statements,
FAIR VALUE MEASUREMENTS
Some of the Group‘s assets and liabilities are measured at fair value for financialreporting purposes
In estimating the fair value at an asset or a liability, the Group uses marketobservahle datatu the extent it is available. Where Level1 mputsare not available,the Group engages third party qualified valuers to perform the valuation. Themanagement works closely with the qualified external valuers to establish theappropriatevaluationtechniquesandinputstothe model.TheGroup usesvaluationtechniques that are appropriate in the circumstances and for which sufﬁment dataare available to measure fair value, maximising the use of relevant observableinputs and minimising the use of unobservable inputs. Changes in estimates andassumptionsabauttheseinputs couldaffectthereportedfairvalue.
Information about the valuation techniques and inputs used in determining thefairvalue of various assets and liabilities are disclosed in Notes 18. 22 and 25 to thefinancialstatements.
TAXES
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations,changes in tax laws, and the amount and timing of future taxable income TheGroup has expusure to income taxes in various jurisdictions due to the wide rangeof international husmess relationships and the longrterm nature and complexity ofexisting contractual agreements, Significantjudgement is involved in determiningthe gmup-wide pmwsiun torincnmetaxesand recuverability ufcertain taxfmm thetax authorities The Group establishes provisions based on reasonable estimates,forpossible consequencesufaudits by thetaxauthorities 0f the respective countiesin which it operates When the ﬁnal tax outcome nfthese matters is different fromthe amuuntsthatwereinitiallyrecognised‘such ditterenceswillimpacttheincometax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.Furtherdetails on taxes are disclosed in Note7
