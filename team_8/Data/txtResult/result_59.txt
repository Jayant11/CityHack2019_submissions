Highlights 2017
During the reporting year, Lonza’s business for bioconjugates, cell therapy and gene therapy experiencedcontinued strong customer interest driven by new regulatory approvals of CAR—T therapies and positive marketmomentum.
In May 2017 Lonza acquired PharmaCell BV (NL), a ceIl-and-gene-therapy contract manufacturer in Europethat successfully launched two commercial autologous cell therapies. The acquisition strengthens Lonza’sautologous cell— and gene—therapy offering and further enhances Lonza’s global cell— and gene—therapy footprint,which is especially important for autologous therapies, where close proximity to the patient is critical.
Another highlight was the continuing construction of the world’s largest dedicated cell— and gene-therapyfacility in Pearland, TX (USA), which is expected come on-stream in Q1 2018. The projects from our existingTexas facility will be transferred to the new installation during 2018. A customer and press event to buildmomentum around the opening of this new facility is scheduled for 10 April 2018.
In February 2017 we entered into a strategic manufacturing agreement with Selecta Biosciences for ancestraladeno-associated viral vector- (Anc80-AAV—) based gene therapy. Lonza will produce an AncSo-AAV—basedgene therapy product for Selecta’s proprietary program for the treatment of methylmalonic acidemia (MMA), arare inborn error of metabolism.
In November 2017 Lonza, Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE) and Akouos, a new biotechnology companyfocused on restoring and preserving hearing with backing from leading life science investors, announced theirstrategic license agreements for exclusive rights to the Anc-AAV gene therapy platform for all hearing andbalance disorders.
Also during this reporting year, which marked a decade of ADC manufacturing, our ADC team won the BestContract 1\Iannfactnrcr Award at the World ADC Conference in San Diego, CA (USA). Lonza reinforced ourstrong position in clinical ADC development and manufacturing at our Visp (CH) site.

Innovation and Initiatives
Our collaboration with Octane Biotech Inc. — based on the CocoonTM technology, a fully automated, cGMP-in-a-box technology — made substantial progress in 2017. We have been successfully targeting and engaging keyplayers in the autologous cell therapy ﬁeld. The CocoonTM technology keeps receiving positive feedback fromcustomers and trade media, and it received the Spark Health 2017 design award. Lonza was invited to give aseries of talks that showcased the CocoonTM technology at a variety of tradeshows and workshops organized byregulatory agencies, including the US. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) and the European MedicinesAgency (EMA).
These activities were complemented by a series of key opinion leader talks about manufacturing automation, aswell as sponsored case studies outlining the respective benefits of the technology.
Also in the ﬁeld of Anc—AAV, our collaboration with Massachusetts Eye and Ear (MEE), which began in 2016with an exclusive licensing agreement, is ongoing. Anc—AAV is a novel AAV technology capable of superior geneexpression and has the potential to overcome critical limitations that exist with current AAV constructs, such aspre—existing immunity.
Our Nikon—Lonza collaboration project — with the aim to offer process development and manufacturing servicesin Japan in the cell—and—gene—therapy ﬁeld — continues to progress according to plan. The new Nikon CeLLinnovation (NCLi) facility in Tokyo (J P) is expected to go live in early 2018.
Lonza’s early engagement in pluripotent stem cells is reaching a critical milestone with several of our clients inthe late stages of ﬁling Investigational New Drug (IND) applications with the FDA for ﬁrst-in-man studies.Innovative approaches, including bioreactor—based expansion and differentiation, are at the core of Lonza’sofferings in that ﬁeld.

Highlights 2017
Strong market demand for our Bioscience technologies continued in 2017, notably the cell biology, transfection,bio—therapeutic media and endotoxin product portfolios.
The reporting year saw the launch of ﬁve new products:
. Idiopathic pulmonary ﬁbrosis (IPF) lung fibroblasts — to support research for treatment of IPF, a rare non—neoplastic pulmonary disease affecting approximately 5 million people worldwide. This release furtherexpanded our airway disease portfolio, which also incorporates cells from asthma, chronic obstructivepulmonary disease (COPD) and cystic fibrosis donors, supporting some of the most important areas inrespiratory research.
- Irradiated mouse-embryonic ﬁbroblasts (iMEF) — an inactivated form of MEF cells that can be used tosupport some stem—cell cultures.
- CytoSlVIARTM 2 System, an upgrade of Lonza’s popular system for affordable live-cell imaging and cell—culture monitoring.
- A new release of MODA—EM ‘3‘ (Version 3.3) — quality—control tools for environmental monitoring orCleanrooms to facilitate compliance with data integrity requirements, while delivering better analytics andreporting.
- Silensomes ‘3‘ HLM — pooled human liver microsomes (HLM) for in—vitro cytochrome P450 (CYP)phenotyping. HLMs are used to support qualitative and quantitative CY P phenotyping methods requested byregulatory agencies for drug metabolism and drug—drug interactions.
In May Lonza acquired HansaBioMed Life Sciences, based in Tallinn (EE) and invested in Exosomics Sicnu, anItalian start-up. These investments reinforced our platform for developing next-generation research andtherapeutic and diagnostic applications based on exosomes.
Bioscience Solutions experienced ongoing positive market demand in 2017; but remediation efforts related tothe production of certain biotherapeutic liquid media products manufactured in one particular area of ourWalkersville, MD (USA), site that is used to produce <20 L containers negatively affected the performance. Weare addressing the issues affecting the Walkersville site with a comprehensive approach and continue to focuson our commitments to the FDA made in connection with the FDA warning letter Lonza Walkersville receivedin April 2017. As of November 2017 and on a rolling basis, we have begun to resume manufacturing in the areawhere it was previoust suspended. First products were released in J anuary 2018; other products have becomegradually available as well. Production of research—use—only (RUO) and certain for—further—manufaeturing(FFM) media products in other manufacturing lines in Walkersville and other global sites have been ongoing.

3CORE Deﬁnition: Lonza believes that disclosing CORE results of the Group’s performance enhances the ﬁnancial markets' understanding of thecompany because the CORE results enable better comparison across years. CORE results exclude exceptional expenses and income related to egg.restructuring, environmentaI-remediation, acquisitions and divestitures, impairments and amortization of acquisition-related intangible assets,which can differ significantly from year to year. For this same reason, Lonza uses these CORE results in addition to IFRS as important factors in
internally assessing the Group's performance.

Highlights 2017
Lonza's Consumer Health division, the former Consumer Care business unit until October 2017, was re-organized after the Capsugel acquisition in order to strengthen Lonza's position in the fast—moving healthcareand nutrition consumer goods market and to drive our growth along the healthcare continuum. ConsumerHealth now consists of Consumer Health and Nutrition and of Consumer Product Ingredients.
The strategic business unit experienced another successful year and contributed to Lonza’s (standalone) full-year 2017 guidance. Growth drivers were the Hygiene and Preservation business and the Nutrition business.
Our Consumer Health and Nutrition business grew strongly in 2017. The continued success of our ﬂagshipingredients Carnipure® L—Carnitine and UC—II® undenatured collagen helped drive this growth.
Following the acquisition of Capsugel in 2017, Consumer Health and Nutrition now further enhances our abilityto combine expertise in high-quality, science-backed ingredients with formulation know-how and industry-leading capsule and encapsulation technologies to create innovative solutions for consumer health and nutritioncompanies.
Lonza expects to continue to benefit from high market demand and innovative product offerings in the fast—growing consumer products markets with Capsugel further strengthening Lonza‘s offerings. One recent exampleis the launch of several new dietary supplement formulas addressing sports, mood, sleep, weight managementand immunity powered by Capsugel’s formulation and finished dosage forms expertise.
Lonza beneﬁted from growth momentum in disinfection solutions in several markets throughout 2017, and wesee ongoing high demand in this non—cyclical business based on changing regulatory requirements. OurHygiene and Preservation businesses performed strongly in 2017 with our extensive portfolio of products. Theseproducts include global solutions registered by the US.

Innovation and Initiatives
The integration of the nutraceuticals specialist InterHealth, acquired by Lonza in September 2016, was one ofthe main projects in 2017 and was successfully completed in the reporting year. One result of the integrationwas the expansion and upgrading of the manufacturing site in Fort Smith, AR (USA) for our UC-II undenaturedcollagen ingredient, a nutritional ingredient clinically proven to beneﬁt consumers by helping to improve jointmobility. It is a key ingredient for many leading brands to develop products in a convenient one—per—day dose.
The other major initiative was the beginning of the integration of Lonza nutritional ingredients and Capsugelformulation and encapsulation capabilities. Capsugel’s strong presence in solutions for the delivery of dietarysupplements opens new opportunities for Lonza’s ingredients. Lonza’s penetration in the food and beverage
segments represents an opportunity to employ Capsugel’s formulation sciences to improve performance and theconsumer experience.

Highlights 2017
During the reporting year, the Agro Ingredients unit was reorganized to integrate Performance Intermediates,which was previously part of Lonza’s Coatings and Composites business. Zelam, a crop protection companyacquired by Lonza in 2015, was renamed Lonza NZ Ltd. in 2017 in order to increase brand awareness and theimage of Lonza in New Zealand and Australia.
Agro Ingredients showed solid growth based on higher demand in animal nutrition. Our vitamin B3 businessfor animal nutrition applications experienced favorable market conditions in all geographies, but a cyclicalmarket demand has to be taken into consideration in a mid— to long—term view. Feed applications for L—Carnitine-based and arabinogalactan-containing formulations also grew by geographic expansion, especially inAsia.
Progress was also made in the build—up of a niche portfolio for selected specialty crops with a range ofagrochemical products and applications, based on Lonza’s broad technology platfonns in chemistry andbiotechnology. Geographic expansion, new label claims and new formulations are supporting the strategicgrowth in this business.
Lonza is one of the world's market leaders in molluscicides, with our offering of Meta® metaldehyde activeingredient and Meta®—based, formulated products. For example, Meta®, Lonza’s speciﬁc molluscicide for slugand snail control in agriculture and home & garden applications, had strong demand from our strategic growthareas in Southeast Asia. We offer solutions for the main pest there — the Golden Apple Snail.
Also we serve the professional and home & garden markets with our formulated end-use molluscicide, Axcela®.In all the main markets, we collaborate with strategic partners and leading local distribution companies tosupport the growth of our premium—quality products.
Additionally, we offer fertilizers and sanitizing agents for the agricultural industry. Our Frexus® line ofbactericides and algaecides to ensure effective sanitization in the food, beverage and farming industries coverspre— and post—harvest treatment needs to ensure fresh and healthy food for consumers. For instance, ourfinished commercial Frexus® CH Sanitizer products are sold in Brazil — one of the largest agricultural marketsin the world — as fertilizers and as disinfectants for fruit and vegetable crops (pre- and post-harvest treatments).

Innovation and Initiatives
Capital expenditure in 2017 included geographical expansion of our crop-protection products into new markets,and investments at our production plants that targeted reduced costs. Lonza also invested in new R&D facilitiesat the Lonza site in New Plymouth (NZ) and in Salto (BR). Furthermore, we were able to expand our portfoliothrough the launch of Frexus® products in Paraguay, as well as Celenco® in Brazil. These initiatives provideLonza the foundation for expanding these product ranges in the future in the Latin America region.
Our aim within the value—added chain of the agricultural sector is to help reduce crop losses and boostproductivity. We enable our customers to optimize the use of increasingly scarce natural resources, such asarable land and clean irrigation water.
These sustainability targets would be impossible to achieve without the use of modern, highly efﬁcient agro-chemistry. Meeting these requirements will take major investments in the research and development of effectiveand sustainable solutions. It will require innovation — and cutting—edge technology companies like Lonza aremaking an important contribution in this regard.

Note 1 - Account Principles
Lonza Group
Lonza Group Ltd and its subsidiaries (hereafter “the Group” or “Lonza”) operate under the name Lonza. LonzaGroup Ltd is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in Switzerland. The Group isheadquartered in Basel, Switzerland. Lonza is one of the world’s leading and most—trusted suppliers to thepharmaceutical, biotech and specialty ingredients markets. It harnesses science and technology to createproducts that support safer and healthier living and that enhance the overall quality of life. With the
2017 Capsugel acquisition, Lonza now offers products and services from the custom development andmanufacturing of active pharmaceutical ingredients to innovative dosage forms for the pharma and consumerhealth and nutrition industries. Benefiting from its regulatory expertise, Lonza is able to transfer its know-howfrom pharma t0 hygiene and fast—moving consumer goods all the way to coatings and composites and thepreservation and protection of agricultural goods and other natural resources.
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements for 2017 and 2016 are reported in Swiss francs (CHF), rounded tomillions, and based on the annual accounts of Lonza Group Ltd (Company) and its subsidiaries at 31 December,which have been drawn up according to uniform Group accounting principles. The consolidated accounts areprepared in accordance with the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and with Swiss law. Theyare prepared on the historical cost basis, except that derivative ﬁnancial instruments and contingentconsiderations are stated at their fair values and the employee beneﬁt liability is stated at the fair value of planassets less the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation.
As a result of the 2017 acquisition of Capsugel SA (see note 4.1) certain of the ﬁnancial statement positions havechanged signiﬁcantly compared to the previous financial year. Therefore, the comparability of the consolidated
balance sheet positions as of the end of 2017 and 2016 as well as the consolidated income statement 2017 and2016 is limited.
Changes in Accounting Standards
There were no new standards or amendments to existing standards that had a significant impact on the Group’sconsolidated financial statements.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 138
===================================================
14.hocr: 
By integrating, modernizing and optimizing Lonza’s enabling functions — like IT, procurement and ﬁnance — weare ensuring that the company structure is fit for further growth. Based on the sound foundation laid in 2017 forthe future, and starting from a new baseline, Lonza (including Capsugel) is announcing the following outlookfor 2018:
- Mid-single-digit sales growth on a comparable basis in line with Mid-Term Guidance 2022o 100 bps improvement in CORE EBITDA margin in line with Mid-Term Guidance 2022
The Outlook 2018 is a next step toward achieving our Mid—Term Guidance 2022. During 2018 the healthcarecontinuum is expected to grow above average while Lonza is executing ongoing optimizations in parts of thebasic portfolio like the discontinuation of fertilizers.
Mid-Term Guidance 2022
With 120 years of company history, Lonza is stronger than ever and well prepared to maintain positivemomentum toward the company’s 125th anniversary in 2022 and beyond. Therefore, Lonza conﬁrms the Mid—Term Guidance 2022, as announced during the half-year results presentation in July 2017:
- Sales CHF 7.5 billion- CORE EBITDA margin 30%- CORE RONOA 35%
During 2018 CORE RONOA (return on net operating assets) will be replaced by ROIC (return on investedcapital).
The Outlook 2018 and Mid—Term Guidance 2022 are based on the present business composition, macro—economic environment, current visibility and constant exchange rates.

The following new and revised standards have been issued, but are not yet effective. They have not been appliedearly in these consolidated financial statements. The current status of the expected effects is disclosed below.
Planned application byStandard / Interpretation Effective date Lonza





IFRS 15 — Revenue from Contracts with Customers ** 1 January 2018 Reporting year 2018IFRS 9 — Financial Instruments * 1 January 2018 Reporting year 2018Amendments to IFRSZ — Classiﬁcation and Measurement ofShare-based Payment Transactions * 1 January 2018 Reporting year 2018IFRIC 22 — Foreign Currency Transactions and AdvanceConsideration ‘

* No or no signiﬁcant impact is expected on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements** The Group‘s assessment on the impacts of adopting these standards is outlined below
IFRS 15 Revenueﬁ'om contracts with customers amends revenue recognition requirements and establishesprinciples for reporting information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cashﬂows arising from contracts with customers. Revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of a goodor service and thus has the ability to direct the use and obtain the beneﬁts from the good or service. Based onthe Group’s assessment the adoption of the new standard will primarily impact its long—term contracts in thecustom manufacturing business and will result in recognition of contract assets for costs incurred during thepre-manufacturing phase as well as additional deferred income related to payments from customers beforesupply of goods. The Group applies a full retrospective application of IFRS15 to enhance comparability. TheGroup expects that the adoption of IFRS 15 will result in the recognition of additional deferred income ofapproximately CHF 100 — 120 million and contract costs of approximately CHF 30 — 40 million as of 31December 2017. The additional deferred income and contract costs are expected to be amortized consistent withthe underlying contractual terms spanning a period of 5 — 10 years. Furthermore, the Group expects that theimplementation of IFRS 15 will have an adverse impact of CHF 15 — 25 million on the restrospective 2017consolidated income statement, as a result of the deferral of certain payments from customers.
IFRS 16 Leases substantially changes the ﬁnancial statements as the majority of leases will become on—balancesheet liabilities with corresponding right of use assets on the balance sheet. The current operating leasecommitments of CHF 170 million as of 31 December 2017 (see note 6) provide, subject to the provision of thestandard, an indicator of the impact of the implementation of IFRS 16 on the Group’s consolidated balancesheet. However, Lonza is still in the process of evaluating the potential impacts of applying IFRS 16.
Principles of Consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements represent the accounts for the year ended 31 December of Lonza GroupLtd and its subsidiaries. Subsidiaries are those entities controlled, directly or indirectly, by Lonza Group Ltd.Control is achieved when the Group is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with theentity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Consolidation of a subsidiarybegins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiary and ceases when the Group loses control of the
Lonza Annual Report 2017 139
===================================================
141.hocr: 
subsidiary. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if they occurafter control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control. The signiﬁcant subsidiariesincluded in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are shown in note 33.
The full consolidation method is used, whereby the assets, liabilities, income and expenses are incorporated infull, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Payables, receivables, income and expensesbetween Lonza-consolidated companies are eliminated. Intercompany proﬁts included in year-end inventoriesof goods produced within Lonza are eliminated, as well as unrealized gains on transactions betweensubsidiaries. Unrealized losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment ofthe asset transferred.
The Group’s interests in equity-accounted investees comprise interests in associates and joint ventures, asdisclosed in note 8. Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control orjoint control, over the ﬁnancial and operating policies, A joint venture is an arrangement in which the Grouphas joint control, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to itsassets and obligations for its liabilities. Associates and interests in joint ventures are accounted for in theconsolidated financial statements using the equity method of accounting. They are recognized initially at cost,which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to the initial recognition, the consolidated financial statementsinclude the Group’s share of the proﬁt and loss and other comprehensive income of equity—accounted investees,until the date on which significant inﬂuence or joint control ceases. Dividends paid during the year reduce thecarrying value of the investments.
Segment Reporting
For the purpose of segment reporting, the Group’s Executive Committee (EC) is considered to be the Group’sChief Operating Decision Maker. The determination of the Group’s operating segments is based on theorganizational units for which information is reported to the EC on a regular basis. The information provided isused as the basis of the segment revenue and proﬁt disclosures reported in note 2. Selected segment balancesheet information and performance measures are also routinely provided to the EC.
Lonza had two segments in the first half of 2017 as well as in 2016: Pharma&Bi0tech and Specialty Ingredients.When Capsugel was acquired on 5 July 2017, it remained a separate operating segment from its acquisition datethrough 31 December 2017. Revenues are primarily generated from the sale of products. The Pharma&Biotechsegment and Capsugel also derive revenues from rendering of services as well as the sale or licensing ofproducts or technology to third parties. Residual operating activities from certain global activities are reportedas “Corporate.” These include the EC and global group functions for communications, human resources, finance(including treasury and taxes), legal, environmental and safety services. Transfer prices between operatingsegments are set on an arm’s-length basis. Operating assets and liabilities consist of property, plant andequipment, goodwill and intangible assets, trade receivables /payables, inventories and other assets andliabilities, such as provisions, which can be reasonably attributed to the reported operating segments. Non—operating assets and liabilities mainly include current and deferred income tax balances, post-employmentbeneﬁt assets / liabilities and ﬁnancial assets / liabilities such as cash, investments and debt. In 2018 the Groupanticipates integrating the Capsugel reporting segment into Pharma&Biotech and Specialty Ingredients.
Revenue Recognition
Sales are recognized when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership of the assets have been transferred toa third party and are reported net of sales taxes and rebates. Rebates to customers are recognized in the sameperiod that the related sales are recorded. Revenue from termination fees is recorded in the income statement inthe period in which the termination occurs. The percentage of completion (POC) method is applied for
Lonza Annual Report 2017 140
===================================================
142.hocr: 
development projects and defined long-term contracts in the Pharma&Biotech segment that have the economicsubstance of a construction contract. The stage of completion of a contract is determined on the basis of theestimated total contract costs. Revenue from the sale of rights is recognized upon transfer of rights or on anaccrual basis, depending on whether the transaction in substance is a sale or a licensing arrangement. Interestincome is recognized on a time—proportion basis using the effective interest method. Dividend income isrecognized when the right to receive payment is established.
Foreign Currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of theprimary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidatedﬁnancial statements are presented in Swiss francs (CHF), which is the Group’s presentation currency. Forconsolidation purposes the balance sheet of foreign consolidated companies is translated to CHF with theexchange rate on the balance sheet date. Income, expenses and cash ﬂows of the foreign consolidatedcompanies are translated into CHF using the monthly average exchange rates during the year (unless thisaverage is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing 0n the transactiondates, in which case income and expenses are translated at the dates of the transactions). Exchange ratedifferences arising from the different exchange rates applied in balance sheets and income statements arerecognized in other comprehensive income. In the individual company’s financial statements, transactions inforeign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate applicable at the date of the transaction. Monetaryassets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreignexchange rate ruling at that date. All resulting foreign exchange gains and losses are recognized in the individualcompany’s profit or loss statement, except when they arise on monetary items that form a part of the Group’snet investment in a foreign entity. In such a case, the exchange gains and losses are recognized in othercomprehensive income.
Derivative Financial Instruments and Hedging
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognized in the balance sheet at their fair value. The method ofrecognizing the resulting gain or loss is dependent on whether the derivative contract is designed to hedge aspecific risk and qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. On the date a derivative contract is entered into, the Groupdesignates derivatives that qualify as hedges for accounting purposes as either a hedge 0f the fair value of arecognized asset, liability or ﬁrm commitment (fair value hedge), a hedge of a forecasted transaction (cash ﬂowhedge) or a hedge of a net investment in a foreign entity. Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are fairvalue hedges are recognized in the income statement, along with any changes in the fair value of the hedgedasset or liability that is attributable to the hedged risk. Changes in the fair value of derivatives in cash ﬂowhedges that are highly effective are recognized in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating to theineffective portion is recognized immediately in the income statement. Where the forecasted transaction resultsin the recognition of an asset or liability, the gains and losses previously included in other comprehensiveincome are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. Otherwise, amounts recorded in othercomprehensive income are transferred to the income statement and classiﬁed as revenue or expense in the sameperiod in which the forecasted transaction affects the income statement.
Certain derivative instruments, while providing effective economic hedges under the Group’s policies, do notqualify for hedge accounting. Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not qualify forhedge accounting are recognized immediately in the income statement.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 141
===================================================
143.hocr: 
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedgeaccounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in equityand is recognized in the income statement, when the committed or forecasted transaction is ultimatelyrecognized in the income statement.
However, if a forecasted 0r committed transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or lossthat was recognized in other comprehensive income is immediately transferred to the income statement.
The purpose of hedge accounting is to match the impact of the hedged item and the hedging instrument in theincome statement. To qualify for hedge accounting, the hedging relationship must meet several strict conditionswith respect to documentation, probability of occurrence, hedge effectiveness and reliability of measurement. Atthe inception of the transaction, the Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments andhedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions.
This process includes linking all derivatives designated as hedges to specific assets and liabilities or to speciﬁcfirm commitments 0r forecasted transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at the hedgeinception and on an ongoing basis, as to whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highlyeffective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂows of hedged items.
The fair value of derivatives (forward exchange contract, FX swaps, commodity swaps and interest rate swaps)is estimated by discounting the difference between the contractual forward price and the current forward pricefor the residual maturity of the contract using a credit-adjusted risk-free rate. Current forward prices areprovided by banks 01' other ﬁnancial service providers.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairmentlosses. The assets are depreciated on a component basis over their estimated useful lives, which vary from 10 to50 years for buildings and structures, and 5 to 16 years for production facilities, machinery, plant, equipmentand vehicles. Fixed assets are depreciated using the straight-line method over their estimated useful lives.Subsequent expenditure incurred to replace a component of an item of property, plant and equipment that isaccounted for separately, including major inspection and overhaul expenditure, is capitalized. Other subsequentexpenditure is capitalized only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the item of property,plant and equipment. Borrowing costs incurred with respect to qualifying assets are capitalized and included inthe carrying value of the assets.
All other expenditure is recognized in the income statement as an expense as incurred. The residual values andthe useful life of items of property, plant and equipment are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at eachbalance sheet date.
Leases
Financial leases, which effectively constitute assets purchased with long—term ﬁnancing, are carried as ﬁxedassets at their purchase price and are written off over their estimated useful lives if the leased assets aretransferred to the lessee at the end of the lease term. If there is no reasonable certainty that the lessee willobtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the asset is fully depreciated over the shorter of the lease termand its useful life. The corresponding liabilities are included in non-current and current debt. The ﬁnance leasegives rise to a depreciation expense for depreciable assets as well as a ﬁnance expense for each accountingperiod. For the purpose of classifying a lease of land and buildings, lease of the land and 0f the buildings isevaluated separately. Lease payments under an operating lease are recognized as an expense in the incomestatement on a straight—line basis over the lease term.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 142
===================================================
144.hocr: 
Intangible Assets
Purchased intangible assets with a ﬁnite useful life are stated at cost less accumulated amortization andaccumulated impairment losses. Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are recognized at theirfair value. Intangibles include software, licenses, patents, trademarks and similar rights granted by thirdparties, capitalized product development costs and capitalized computer software development costs. Costsassociated with internally developed or maintained computer software programs are recognized as an expenseas incurred. Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software productscontrolled by the Group, and that will probably generate future economic beneﬁts exceeding costs beyond oneyear, are recognized as intangible assets. Those direct costs include the software development employee costsand an appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Intangible assets are amortized using the straight—linemethod over their estimated useful lives, which is the lower of the legal duration and the economic useful life.Useful lives vary from 3 to 5 years for software, 5 to 35 years for patents, trademarks and similar rights and 4 to16 years for development costs. All intangible assets in Lonza have ﬁnite useful lives, except for the Capsugeltrade name acquired in 2017 and the trademarks acquired in 2011 through the Arch Chemicals businesscombination and 2007 through the Cambrex business combination. The Group considers that these trademarkshave an indeﬁnite useful life as they are well established in the respective markets and have a history of strongperformance. The Group intends and has the ability to maintain these trademarks for the foreseeable future.
Goodwill and Business Combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred in abusiness combination is measured at fair value at the date of acquisition and includes the cash paid plus the fairvalue at the date of exchange of assets, liabilities incurred or assumed and equity instruments issued by theGroup. The fair value of the consideration transferred also includes contingent consideration arrangements atfair value. Directly attributable acquisition—related costs are expensed in the period the costs are incurred andthe services are received and reported within administration and general overhead expenses. At the date ofacquisition, the Group recognizes the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumed and any non-controlling interest in the acquired business. The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed areinitially recognized at fair value. Where the Group does not acquire 100% ownership of the acquired business,non—controlling interests are recorded as the proportion of the fair value of the acquired net assets attributableto the non-controlling interest. Goodwill is recorded as the surplus of the consideration transferred over theGroup’s interest in the fair value of the acquired net assets. Any goodwill and fair value adjustments arerecorded as assets / liabilities of the acquired business in the functional currency of that business,
When the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete at the end of a reporting period,provisional amounts are recognized. During the measurement period, the provisional amounts areretrospectively adjusted and additional assets and liabilities may be recognized to reﬂect new informationobtained about the facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date which, had they been known,would have affected the measurement of the amounts recognized at that date. The measurement period doesnot exceed 12 months from the date of acquisition. Goodwill is not amortized but is tested annually forimpairment. Changes in ownership interests in subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions if theyoccur after control has already been obtained and if they do not result in a loss of control,
Goodwill may also arise upon investments in associates and joint ventures, being the surplus of the cost ofinvestment over the Group’s share of the fair value of the net identifiable assets. Such goodwill is recordedwithin investments in associates and joint ventures.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 143
===================================================
145.hocr: 
Inventories
Inventories are reported at the lower of cost (purchase price or production cost) or market value (net realizablevalue). In determining net realizable value, any costs of completion and selling costs are deducted from therealizable value. The cost of inventories is calculated using the weighted average method. Prorated productionoverheads are included in the valuation of inventories. Adjustments are made for inventories with a lowermarket value or which are slow moving. Unsalable inventory is fully written off. Costs include all expendituresrelated directly to speciﬁc projects and an allocation of ﬁxed and variable overheads incurred in the Group’scontract activities based on normal operating capacity.
Receivables
Trade receivables are recognized at the original invoice amount less allowances made for doubtful accounts. Anallowance for doubtful accounts is recorded for the difference between the cariying value and the estimatedrecoverable amount where there is obj ective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due.These estimates are based on speciﬁc indicators, such as the aging of customer balances, speciﬁc creditcircumstances and the Group’s historical experience, also taking into account economic conditions Expensesfor doubtful trade receivables are recognized in the consolidated income statement within cost of goods sold.Long—term accounts receivable are discounted to take into account the time value of money, where material.
Financial Assets
Loans and advances and other ﬁnancial assets are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinablepayments that are not quoted in an active market. They arise when the Group provides money, goods or servicesdirectly to a debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are classified as current with maturities notlonger than 12 months and as non-cnrrent with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date.Loans and advances are carried at amortized costs using the effective interest method. Realized and unrealizedgains and losses are recorded in the income statement in the period in which they arise. The Group derecognizesa ﬁnancial asset when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the asset expire, or it transfers the rights toreceive the contractual cash ﬂows in a transaction in which substantially all the risk and rewards of ownershipof the ﬁnancial asset are transferred. Any interest in such transferred ﬁnancial assets that is created or retainedby the Group is recognized as a separate asset or liability.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, in postal and bank accounts, as well as short—term deposits andhighly liquid funds that have an original maturity of less than three months.
Impairment
Assets that are subject to amortization and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events orchanges in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Goodwill and intangibleassets with indeﬁnite useful lives are tested for impairment annually, and whenever there is an indication that
Lonza Annual Report 2017 144
===================================================
146.hocr: 
the assets may be impaired. An impairment loss is recognized for the amount by which the asset’s carryingamount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costsof disposal and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levelsfor which there are separately identiﬁable cash ﬂows (cash-generating units).
Calculation of recoverable amount — In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted totheir present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value ofmoney and the risks speciﬁc to the asset.
Reversal of impairment — An impairment loss is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount canbe related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognized. An impairment loss inrespect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been achange in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to theextent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,net of depreciation or amortization, if no impairment loss had been recognized.
Assets Held for Sale
Disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities are classiﬁed as held-for-sale if it is highly probable that theywill be recovered primarily through sale rather than through continuing use.
Such disposal groups are generally measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs tosell. Any impairment loss on a disposal group is allocated ﬁrst to goodwill and then to the remaining assets andliabilities on a pro rata bases, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets or deferred taxassets, which continue to be recognized in accordance with the Group’s other accounting policies. Impairmentlosses on initial classiﬁcation as held—for—sale and subsequent gains and losses on remeasurement arerecognized in proﬁt or loss. Once classiﬁed as held—for—sale, intangible assets and property, plant andequipment are no longer amortized or depreciated.
Deferred Taxes
Tax expense is calculated using the balance—sheet liability method. Additional deferred taxes are providedwherever temporary differences exist between the tax base of an asset or liability and its carrying amount in theconsolidated accounts for the year.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differencesbetween the ﬁnancial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax basesand, for deferred tax assets, operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted or substantially enacted tax rates in the respectivejurisdictions in which Lonza operates that are expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which thosetemporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled. In assessing the recoverability of deferred taxassets, management considers whether it is probable that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will notbe realized. For transactions and other events recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity,any related tax effect is recognized in other comprehensive income or in equity. Liabilities for income taxes,mainly withholding taxes, which could arise on the remittance of retained earnings, principally relating tosubsidiaries, are only recognized where it is probable that such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeablefuture.

Employee Benefits
Employee-beneﬁt liabilities as stated in the consolidated balance sheet include obligations from deﬁned-benefitpension plans, other post-employment benefits (medical plans) as well as other long-term employee-relatedliabilities, such as long—term vacation accounts.
Defined-Beneﬁt Plans (Pension and Medical Plans)
Most of Lonza’s subsidiaries operate their own pension plans. Generally, they are funded by employees’ andemployers’ contributions. In addition, the Group operates three medical plans in the United States. The Group’snet obligation in respect of defined-benefit plans is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amountof future benefit that employees have earned in the current and prior periods, discounting that amount anddeducting the fair value of any plan assets. The calculation of defined—beneﬁt obligations is performed annuallyby a qualiﬁed external actuary using the proj ected unit credit method. When the calculation results in apotential asset for the Group, the recognized asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits availablein the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculatethe present value of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum fundingrequirements. Remeasurements 0f the deﬁned-beneﬁt liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses andthe return on plan assets (excluding interest) and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), arerecognized immediately in other comprehensive income.
The Group determines the net interest expense on the net defined—benefit liabilities for the period by applyingthe discount rate used to measure the defined-benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the netdeﬁned-beneﬁt liability, taking into account any changes in the net defined-benefit liability during the period asa result of contributions and benefit payments. Net interest expense and other expenses related to defined—beneﬁt plans are recognized in proﬁt or loss. While the net interest expense is disclosed within ﬁnancialexpenses, the other expenses related to deﬁned-beneﬁt plans are allocated to the different functions of theoperating activities. When the beneﬁts of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change inbeneﬁt that related to past service or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognized immediately in proﬁt or loss.The Group recognizes gains and losses on the settlement of a defined-benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
Provisions
A provision is recognized in the balance sheet when (i) the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as aresult of a past event, (ii) it is probable that an outﬂow of economic benefits will be required to settle theobligation, and (iii) a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. If the effect is material,provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂows at a pre—tax rate that reﬂects currentmarket assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability.
A provision for restructuring is recognized when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuringplan, and the restructuring has either commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs arenot provided for.
Provisions for environmental liabilities are made when there is a legal or constructive obligation for the Groupthat will result in an outﬂow of economic resources. Provisions are made for remedial work where there is anobligation to remedy environmental damage, as well as for containment work where required by environmentalregulations.

Debt
Debt instruments are initially recorded at cost, which is the proceeds received net of transaction costs. They aresubsequently stated at amortized cost; any difference between the net proceeds and the redemption value isrecognized in the income statement over the period of the debt instrument using the effective interest method.
Share Capital
Ordinary shares are classiﬁed as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares oroptions are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Where any Group company purchasesLonza Group Ltd’s equity share capital (treasury shares), the consideration paid, including any directlyattributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted from equity attributable to the Group’s equityholders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of.
Dividend
Dividend distribution to Lonza’s shareholders is recognized as a liability in the Group’s ﬁnancial statements inthe period in which the dividends are approved by the Lonza shareholders.
Share-Based Compensation
The Group operates various equity—settled, share—based compensation plans. The fair value of the employeeservices received in exchange for the grant of shares and other share—based compensations is recognized as anexpense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value ofthe shares granted. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of shares that areexpected to become vested. It recognizes the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the incomestatement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period.
Research and Development
Research and development costs are generally charged against income as incurred. Development costs are onlycapitalized when the related products meet the recognition criteria of an internally generated intangible asset,which mainly require the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset, the probability of futureeconomic beneﬁts, the reliable measurement of costs and the ability and intention of the Group to use or sell theintangible asset. Fixed assets (buildings, machinery, plant, equipment) used for research purposes are valuedsimilarly to other ﬁxed assets. Such assets are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives.Expenses for research and development include associated wages and salaries, material costs, depreciation onfixed assets, as well as overhead costs.

Other Operating Income and Other OperatingExpenses
Other operating income and other operating expenses include items not assignable to other functions of theconsolidated income statement. They mainly include gains and losses from the disposal of intangible assets,property, plant and equipment and other non—current assets, income and expenses from the release andrecognition of provisions, income and expense related to restructuring, gains and losses from currency—relatedoperating derivative instruments, as well as operating exchange rate gains and losses.
Net Financing Costs
Net ﬁnancing costs comprise interest payable on borrowings calculated using the effective interest method, theinterest expenses on the net deﬁned-beneﬁt liability, the finance charge for ﬁnance leases, dividend income,foreign exchange gains and losses arising on ﬁnancial assets and liabilities, gains and losses on hedginginstruments that are recognized in the income statement and gains/losses on sale of ﬁnancial assets. Interestincome/expense is recognized in the income statement as it accrues, taking into account the effective yield ofthe asset or liability or an applicable ﬂoating rate. Dividend income is recognized in the income statement onthe date that the dividend is declared. Interest income and expense include the amortization of any discount orpremium or other differences between the initial carrying amount of an interest—bearing instrument and itsamount at maturity calculated on an effective interest rate basis.
Significant Accounting Estimates and J udgments
Key assumptions and sources of estimation uncertainty
Use of Estimates
The preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and related disclosures in conformity with International FinancialReporting Standards requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reportedamounts of assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses. Actual results could differ from those estimates. Estimatesare used in impairment tests, accounting for allowances for doubtful receivables, inventory obsolescence,depreciation, employee beneﬁts, taxes, restructuring provisions and contingencies. Estimates and assumptionsare reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reﬂected in the financial statements in the period theyare determined to be necessary. The key assumptions about the future key sources of estimation uncertaintythat entail a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities withinthe next ﬁnancial year are described below.

Impairment Test of Property, Plant and Equipment,Intangible Assets and Goodwill
The Group has carrying values with regard to property, plant and equipment of CHF 3,198 million (2016: CHF2,412 million), goodwill of CHF 4,002 million (2016: CHF 1,287 million) and intangible assets of CHF 3,701million (2016: CHF 968 million) (see notes 5 and 6). The intangible assets include trademarks acquired throughbusiness combinations with a carrying value of CHF 630 million (2016: CHF 387 million), which have anindeﬁnite useful life and are not systematically amortized. Goodwill and intangible assets with indeﬁnite usefullives are reviewed annually for impairment. To assess if any impairment exists, estimates are made of the futurecash ﬂows expected to result from the use of the asset and its possible disposal. Actual outcomes could varysigniﬁcantly from such estimates of discounted future cash ﬂows. Factors such as changes in the planned use ofbuildings, machinery or equipment, or closure of facilities, the presence or absence of competition, technicalobsolescence or lower—than—anticipated sales for products with capitalized rights could result in shorteneduseful lives or impairment. The impairment analysis as explained in note 5 is most sensitive to the discount rateused for the discounted cash ﬂow model, as well as the expected future cash-inﬂows and the growth rate usedfor calculation purposes. The key assumptions used to determine the recoverable amount for the different cash—generating units are further explained in note 5.2
Pensions
Many of the Group’s employees participate in post—employment plans. The calculations of the recognized assetsand liabilities from such plans are based upon statistical and actuarial calculations. In particular, the presentvalue of the deﬁned-beneﬁt obligation is inﬂuenced by assumptions on discount rates used to arrive at thepresent value of future pension liabilities and assumptions on future increases in salaries and benefits.Furthermore, the Group’s independent external actuaries use statistically based assumptions, covering areassuch as future withdrawals of participants from the plan and estimates of life expectancy. At 31 December 2017,the present value of the Group’s deﬁned-beneﬁt obligation was CHF 3,264 million (2016: CHF 3,145 million).The plan assets at fair value amounted to CHF 2,730 million (2016: CHF 2,472 million), resulting, comparedwith the present value of the pension obligation, in a funded status deﬁcit of CHF 534 million (2016: CHF 673million) (see note 24.1). The actuarial assumptions used may differ materially from actual results due tochanges in market and economic conditions, higher or lower withdrawal rates or longer or shorter lifespans ofparticipants and other changes in the factors being assessed. These differences could affect the fair value ofassets or liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in future periods.
Business Combinations
Where the Group acquires control of another business, the identifiable assets acquired, the liabilities assumedand any non-controlling interest in the acquired business shall be recognized, separately from goodwill. Theprocess of assessing fair values requires in particular management involvement and judgment in the recognitionand measurement of the following items:
- Intellectual property, such as patents, licenses, trademarks, customer relations, technologies and similarrights
- Contingencies, such as legal and environmental matters
- Contingent consideration arrangements

In all cases, management makes an assessment based on the underlying economic substance of the items inorder to fairly present these items.
Environmental Provisions
Lonza is exposed to environmental liabilities and risks relating to its operations, principally in respect ofprovisions for remediation costs, which at 31 December 2017 amounted to CHF 113 million (2016: CHF 92million), as disclosed in note 14. Provisions for non-reeurring remediation costs are made when there is a legalor constructive obligation and the cost can be reliably estimated. It is difﬁcult to estimate any future actionrequired by Lonza to correct the effects on the environment of prior disposal or release of chemical substancesby Lonza or other parties, and the associated costs, pursuant to environmental laws and regulations. Thematerial components of the environmental provisions consist of costs to clean and refurbish contaminated sitesand to treat and contain contamination at sites. The Group’s future remediation expenses are affected by anumber of uncertainties that include, but are not limited to, the method and extent of remediation and theresponsibility attributable to Lonza at the remediation sites, relative to that attributable to other parties. TheGroup permanently monitors the various sites identiﬁed as at risk for environmental exposures. Lonza believesthat its provisions are adequate, based upon currently available information; however, given the inherentdifﬁculties in estimating liabilities in this area, there is no guarantee that additional costs will not be incurredbeyond the amounts provided. Due to the uncertainty both of the amount and timing of future expenses, theprovisions provided for environmental remediation costs could be affected in future periods.
Income Taxes
At 31 December 2017, deferred tax assets of CHF 33 million (2016: CHF 38 million), non—current tax receivablesof CHF 15 million (2016: none), current tax receivables of CHF 80 million (2016: CHF 16 million), deferred taxliabilities of CHF 760 million (2016: CHF 329 million), non-Current tax payables of CHF 46 million
(2016: none) and current tax payables of CHF 196 million (2016: CHF 88 million) are included in theconsolidated balance sheet. Signiﬁcant estimates are required in determining the current and deferred assetsand liabilities for income taxes. Some of these estimates are based on interpretations of existing tax laws orregulations. Management believes that the estimates are reasonable and that the recognized liabilities forincome tax—related uncertainties are adequate. Various internal and external factors may have favorable 0runfavorable effects on the actual amounts of estimated income tax assets and liabilities. These factors include,but are not limited to, changes in tax laws, regulations and / or rates, changing interpretations of existing taxlaws or regulations and changes in overall levels of pre—tax earnings. Such changes that arise could affect theassets and liabilities recognized in the balance sheet in future periods. The enactment of the United States TaxCuts and J obs Act in December 2017 required significant estimates to determine the adjustments of the Group'scurrent tax payables and its deferred tax assets and liabilities. These signiﬁcant estimates are disclosed in note22.

Critical Accounting J udgments in Applying theGroup’s Accounting Policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, management has made the following judgments thathave the most significant effect on the amounts recognized in the ﬁnancial statements (apart from thoseinvolving estimations, which are dealt with above).
Revenue Recognition
The Group has recognized revenue for sales of goods during 2017 to customers who have the right to rescind thesale if the goods do not meet the agreed quality. The Group believes that, based on past experience with similartransactions, the quality delivered will be accepted. Therefore, it is appropriate to recognize revenue on thesetransactions during 2017. Moreover, the Group has various contractual agreements which include upfront andmilestone payments over a period of several years. Revenue is recognized only when, according tomanagement’s judgment, risks and rewards have been transferred to the customer and no future performanceobligation exists. For certain transactions, recognition of revenue is based on the performance of the conditionsagreed in particular contracts, the veriﬁcation of which requires evaluation and judgments by management.
Intangible Assets
The Group considers the Capsugel trade name acquired through the business combination in 2017 as well as thetrademarks acquired in 2011 through the Arch Chemicals business combination and in 2007 through theCambrex business combination to have an indefinite useful life as they are well established in the respectivemarkets and have a history of strong performance. The Group intends and has the ability to maintain thesetrademarks for the foreseeable future. The assumption of an indefinite useful life is reassessed whenever there isan indication that a trademark may have a deﬁnite useful life. In addition, intangible assets with indefiniteuseful lives are tested for impairment on an annual basis (see note 5).

The recoverable amount of the above cash—generating units is based on the value—in—use calculation. These cashﬂow projections for 2018 to 2022 are based on the Lonza business strategy review and exclude any future cashinﬂows and outﬂows expected to arise from growth potential of future capital expenditures.
The cash ﬂow projections beyond the five—year period, as stated in the respective paragraphs of the cash—generating units, are based on the concept of perpetual growth rates, which do not necessarily reﬂect theGroup’s strategic objective targets for the future growth potential of the underlying businesses.
The key assumptions and the approach to determining the recovery value of the significant cash-generatingunits are based on the following:
The goodwill arising from the acquisition of Capsugel in July 2017 is allocated to the group of cash—generatingunits reﬂecting the acquired businesses, which are Capsugel's Consumer Health and Nutrition business, thePharma Capsules business and the Dosage Forms and Delivery Systems business. The cash ﬂow projections for2018—2022 are based on a 6.1% average sales growth with growing EBIT margins. The cash ﬂow projectionsbeyond the ﬁve-year period are based on a 2.5% growth rate. A pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% has been used indiscounting the projected cash ﬂows. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the keyassumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed itsrecoverable amount.

The Specialty Ingredients business includes the cash-generating units of Consumer Health, Agro Ingredients,Coatings and Composites (excluding Wood Protection), Wood Protection and Water Care. These cash—generating units are the combination of the activities acquired through the Arch Chemicals acquisition in 2011,the former Life Science Ingredients activities from Lonza and the InterHealth Nutraceuticals acquisition in2016. The cash ﬂow projections for 2018—2022 are based on a 4.8% (2016: 4.5%) average sales growth. Thecash ﬂow projections beyond the five—year period are based on a 1% growth rate (2016: 1%). A pre—tax discountrate of 8.8% (2016: 8.5%) has been used in discounting the projected cash ﬂows. Management believes that anyreasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is based would not causethe carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The Bioscience Solutions / Cell Therapy / Viral Therapeutics businesses include the Cambrex Corporation,acquired in 2007, the amaxa business, acquired in 2008, MODA Technology Partners and Vivante cGMPSolutions, acquired in 2010, Triangle Research Labs, acquired in 2016, as well as PharmaCell, acquired in May2017. The cash ﬂow projections for 2018—2022 are based on a 14.3% (2016: 9.4%) average sales growth. Thecash ﬂow projections beyond the five-year period are extrapolated using a 0.5% (2016: 0.5%) growth rate. Apre-tax discount rate of 8.1% (2016: 7.7%) has been used in discounting the projected cash ﬂows. Managementbelieves that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is basedwould not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.
The goodwill arising from the acquisition of InterHealth Nutraceuticals in September 2016 is allocated to theConsumer Health business. The cash ﬂow projections for 2018—2022 are based on a 5.2% (2016: 7.6%) averagesales growth with growing EBIT margins. The cash ﬂow projections beyond the five—year period are based on a1% (2016: 1%) growth rate. A pre—tax discount rate of 7.6% (2016: 8.1%) has been used in discounting theprojected cash ﬂows. Management believes that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions onwhich the recoverable amount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

1Local government requested Lonza to close its Guangzhou (CN) manufacturing site. In response, Lonza entered into an agreement with a third-party property development company to jointly develop the original land into commercial properties. According to the agreement, Lonza providedthe land and the property development company offered the funds and assumed construction responsibilities. In 2017 Lonza obtained its entitledportion of commercial properties based on the agreement. A non-cash gain of the property fair value was recognized in 201 7. The fair value of thepropeny was determined by independent external propeny valuation specialist.
Commitments for capital expenditure in property, plant and equipment amounted to CHF 107 million at year—end 2017 (2016: CHF 165 million), mainly related to capital expenditures at the US sites as well as for the Swiss—based operations. The carrying amount of property, plant and equipment under finance lease contracts at year-end 2017 amounted to CHF 9 million (2016: CHF 5 million). Depreciation relating to property, plant andequipment under finance lease amounted to CHF 0.6 million (2016: CHF 0.3 million) No assets were pledgedfor security of own liabilities in 2017 and 2016. The Group’s obligation under finance leases is secured by thelessors’ title to the leased assets.

Lonza leases a number of vehicles, buildings, warehouses, factory and ofﬁce facilities under operating leases.These leases run for periods between one and 20 years, all with an option to renew the lease after that date.
None of the leases include contingent rentals.
During the year ended 31 December 2017, CHF 29 million (2016: CHF 19 million) was recognized as an expense
in the consolidated income statement in respect of operating leases.
The land and building elements of a lease of land and buildings were considered separately for the purpose of
lease classiﬁcation as outlined in IAS 17.
2. Lessor
There is an operating lease for which Lonza acts as lessor. This lease falls within the scope of IAS 17 and IFRIC 4guidance. It consists primarily of a biopharmaceutical manufacturing facility in Visp. The future minimum leasepayments under non-cancelable operating leases are zero, because the lease payments are pre-financed by the
customer.

In the Pharma&Bi0tech segment, the percentage of completion (POC) method was applied to account for
development contracts. The stage of completion is estimated on the basis of costs incurred, compared with total
forecasted costs. This accounting method is applied only to customer contracts with defined payment and
delivery dates. Contract costs are usually recognized as an expense in the income statement in the accounting
periods in which the work is performed. An expected excess of contract cost over total contract revenue isrecognized as an expense as soon as it is apparent that total contract cost may exceed total contract revenue.

Accounts Receivable Securitization Programs
Lonza maintains two securitization programs for its US businesses, one with PNC Bank, National Associationand another with Wells Fargo Bank, NA.
Under the programs, Lonza sells certain US. and Canadian trade accounts receivable t0 PNC Bank (for the ArchChemicals business and Lonza Walkersvilie Inc) and to Wells Fargo Bank, NA. (for the Capsugel business)through two wholly owned subsidiaries, Arch Chemicals Receivables LLC and Capsugel Funding LLC.
The amount of receivables that Lonza can fund under the programs is subject to change based upon the level ofeligible receivables, with a maximum amount of USD 105 million (2016: USD 50 million) at 31 December 2017
in the aggregate.
Under the programs, the payment by PNC Bank and Wells Fargo Bank, NA. for a portion of the purchase priceis deferred until the transferred underlying receivables have been completely settled. Lonza’s maximumexposure related to the receivables sold is equal to the deferred purchase price component, which issubstantially higher than the average expected credit loss on the receivables. As a result, Lonza continues torecognize all of the transferred receivables in the consolidated balance sheet.
As of 31 December 2017, the consolidated balance sheet includes receivables which Lonza sold to PNC Bank /Wells Fargo Bank, NA. for which it obtained funds of USD 69 million (2016: USD 22 million). These aredisclosed as “Other current liabilities” (note 15).

Adding Capsugel to Create an IntegratedService Provider for the HealthcareContinuum
In 2017 Lonza completed the acquisition of U.S.—based Capsugel. Capsugel — now a Lonza company — designs,develops and manufactures a wide range of innovative dosage forms for more than 4,000 customers in thebiopharmaceutical and consumer health and nutrition industries in more than 100 countries.

The acquisition of Capsugel accelerates Lonza’s strategy to grow and deliver value along the healthcarecontinuum by complementing our existing offerings and by opening up new market opportunities in thepharma and consumer health industries. This transformational step positions Lonza as a unique integratedglobal leader serving those industries.
With Capsugel’s additional sales, 66% 0f Lonza’s total revenues are now derived from providing proﬁtablesolutions to customers in the pharma and consumer healthcare and nutrition industries.
After the successful closing of the acquisition of Capsugel on 5 July 2017, the post—deal integration beganimmediately. Lonza puts a strong focus on business continuity while the integration successfully proceeded asplanned. All integration workstreams made great progress during 2017 on the journey to bring our two world-class companies together; and at the beginning of 2018, we started to work as one company. Colleagues acrossthe globe have started to build relationships, share expertise and work as one team to bring quality, innovationand excellence to customers — from ingredient sourcing to finished dosage forms.
To energize the one-team spirit, Lonza leaders have been visiting Capsugel sites around the world to meet withteams, to welcome colleagues into the Lonza family and to raise any issues and capture potential opportunities.Lonza and Capsugel employees are committed to the common path of offering high—quality products andservices along the healthcare continuum‘

Lonza Group Ltd and the operating company Lonza Ltd are domiciled in Switzerland. The maximum rate of allincome taxes on companies domiciled in Switzerland is 8% (2016: 8%) for holding companies and 22% foroperating companies in the Canton of Valais (2016: 22%).
Since the Group operates across the world, it is subject to income taxes in several different tax jurisdictions.Lonza uses, as the Group’s tax rate, the ordinary tax rate for a legal entity in the Canton of Valais in Switzerland.The Group’s effective tax rate for 2017 is —25% (2016: 19%).
The enactment of the United States Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (TCJA) and the Belgium Tax Reform, both inDecember 2017, reduced, among other provisions, the US Federal tax rate from 35% to 21% and the Belgium taxrate from 34% to 29.6% (for the years 2018 and 2019) and 25% (for year 2020 and following years). As a resultof the changes in tax law, Lonza recognized substantial non—recurring adjustments to its current tax payablesand its deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting in a net income tax beneﬁt of CHF 187 million resulting in anegative group effective tax rate. Excluding the impacts of tax reform, Lonza Group would have had an effectivetax rate of 6.8% for 2017.
The following table represents the key components of the aforementioned adjustments on deferred tax assetsand liabilities and current tax payables:

The enacted U.S. tax reform legislation includes a provision that requires the U.S. parent company’s foreignsubsidiaries’ unremitted earnings to be subj ect to an immediate toll tax on the qualifying amount of unremittedearnings (mandatory repatriation transition tax). Previously, these earnings were only taxable upon distributionto the U.S. parent company. Lonza had provided deferred tax liabilities amounting to CHF 24 million related to

===================================================
201.hocr: 
certain of its non-US domiciled afﬁliates’ unremitted earnings in the past, which have been released as a resultof the TCJA. Conversely, Lonza recorded an estimate of CHF 50 million repatriation tax liability onaccumulated post-1986 foreign earnings that is reported in taxes payable, as the toll tax amount owed is payableover eight years through 2026 (with the ﬁrst of eight installments due in April 2019), independent from theeffective distribution of deemed repatriated earnings.
The TCJA subjects a US. shareholder to current tax on global intangible low—taxed income earned by certainforeign subsidiaries. Under IFRS, an entity can make an accounting policy election to either recognize deferredtaxes for temporary basis differences expected to reverse as global intangible low—taxed income in future yearsor provide for the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. We have elected to providefor the tax expense related to such income in the year the tax is incurred. As a result, there is no recordedimpact from the global intangible low—taxed income in the current year.
The estimated tax payables for the mandatory repatriation transition tax are considered to be Lonza’s bestestimate at this point in time and are based on several assumptions (e.g. earnings and proﬁts in the Group’sforeign subsidiaries (including the portion in cash), foreign tax credits and other foreign losses available, andassertions on any remaining outside basis differences as of 31 December 2017). The estimate for the repatriationtax contains information that was readily available to us.
Certain information necessary to complete our evaluation of the ﬁnancial statement impacts of TCJA was notreadily available and Lonza will revise these estimates during 2018. Such revisions could be material asadditional information to complete the tax returns is gathered and as any interpretation or clariﬁcation of theTCJA occurs through legislation, US. Treasury actions or other means.
Capital taxes of CHF 19 million (2016: CHF 12 million) are included in “Administration and general overheads”.

24.1 Deﬁned-Beneﬁt Pension Plans
The group operates deﬁned—benefit pension plans in various countries, with the major plans being inSwitzerland, Great Britain and the United States (as described below). For pension accounting purposes, theseplans are considered as deﬁned—beneﬁt plans.
Pension Plan in Switzerland
The Group’s Swiss pension plan is governed by the Swiss Federal Law on Occupational Retirement, Survivorsand Disability Pension Plans (BVG), and is funded through a legally separate trustee—administered pension fund(Pensionskasse der Lonza). The Board of Trustees is responsible for the investment of the assets, which cannotrevert to the Company. The cash funding of these plans, which may from time to time involve special payments,is designed to ensure that present and future contributions should be sufficient to meet future liabilities.
The plan contains a cash balance beneﬁt formula, accounted for as a defined-benefit plan. Employer andemployee contributions are deﬁned in the pension fund rules in terms of an age-related sliding scale ofpercentages of pay. Under Swiss law, the company guarantees the vested beneﬁt amount as confirmed annually

to members. Interest may be added to member balances at the discretion of the Board ofTrustees. The riskslinked to retirement benefits (disability and death) have been reinsured until 31 December 2020. Theinvestment risk is not reinsured.
Retirement benefits are based on the accumulated retirement capital (made up of yearly contributions and theinterest thereon), which can either be drawn as a life-long annuity or as a lump sum payment or a combinationof both. The annuity is calculated by multiplying the retirement capital with the applicable conversion ratedefined in the fund rules. The Board of Trustees may adjust the annuity at its discretion subject to the plan’sfunded status including sufﬁcient free funds as determined according to Swiss statutory valuation rules.
Retirement benefits and related plan assets of plan participants with a retirement date on or before 31December 2007 were transferred to an insurance company. The insurance company guarantees theseretirement beneﬁts and bears the investment, death and disability risks.
Pension Plan in the UK
The Group operates two major plans in the UK, the Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme and the Lonza BiologicsPension Scheme. Both plans are closed to new entrants. In addition, both schemes are registered schemes underUK legislation, are contracted out of the State Second Pension and are subject to the scheme fundingrequirements outlined in UK legislation. The plans are managed by corporate trustee bodies, which overseeinvestment strategy and general regulatory compliance.
The Hickson UK Group Pension Scheme is the deﬁned-beneﬁt pension plan of the UK Arch Chemicals business.Pensions are linked to ﬁnal salaries and service, and statutory inﬂation increases apply, except wherecontractually different. Ongoing contributions are sufficient to fund current accrual rates, and a deficit recoveryplan has been in place for a number ofyears to recover any shortfall in funding.
The Lonza Biologics Pension Scheme provides pensions in retirement and death beneﬁts to members. Pensionbeneﬁts are linked to a member’s ﬁnal salary at retirement and their length of service.
Pension Plans in the United States
Lonza currently sponsors three qualiﬁed defined-benefit pension plans in the United States. All of the deﬁned-beneﬁt pension plans are fully frozen with respect to future benefit accruals (with the exception of a small groupof participants). All eligible U.S. employees currently participate in a deﬁned—contribution retirement p1an.A11eligible U.S. employees currently participate in one of the two current deﬁned-contribution retirement plans (itis anticipated that effective 1 J anuary 2019, the two current deﬁned contribution plans will be merged).
As of December 31, 2016, the Pension Plan ofArch Chemicals and the Employees’ Retirement Plan of Lonza Inc.purchased a Group Annuity Contract and transferred the related liability and plan assets for a selected group ofretirees (approximately 1,500) from two of the pension plans to Voya Retirement Insurance and AnnuityCompany, resulting in a settlement gain of CHF 1 million.
Pension beneﬁts for the majority of U.S. pension plan participants are generally based on ﬁnal average pay andcredited service as of the date of termination or as of the date beneﬁt accruals were frozen (if earlier), and arepayable as a lifetime pension. Participants in the Cash Balance formula under the Pension Plan of ArchChemicals are covered under an account-based formula that is credited each year with interest based on theyield on ten—year U.S. Treasury securities. Participants in these plans may commence beneﬁt payments uponattainment of normal retirement age or, if applicable, as of an early retirement age (usually age 55) provided thecriteria for early retirement have been met as of the participant’s termination of employment with theCompany. Participants in the Cash Balance plan may elect to commence benefits upon termination ofemployment either in a single lump sum or as a lifetime annuity, or they may defer payment to a later date.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 205
===================================================
207.hocr: 
Pension benefit payments from the qualified pension plans are paid from a trustee—administered fund. Thequalified deﬁned-benefit plans, whose assets are held in a master trust, are subject to minimum fundingrequirements and are subject to further regulation under the Internal Revenue Code and the EmployeesRetirement Income Security Act of 1974 (ERISA). Responsibility for governance of these qualiﬁed plans lieswith a committee of pension plan fiduciaries appointed by Lonza. Actuarial valuations are completed each yearfor each plan to determine the contribution requirement. The minimum annual contribution for each plan isequal to the present value of benefits accrued each year (if any), plus expected administrative expenses of theplan to be paid from the trust, plus a rolling amortization of any prior underfunding. The plan sponsor mayelect to contribute more than the minimum, in which case the excess amounts may under certain Circumstances
be used to offset future funding requirements.

Equity-Settled Share Schemes
Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP)
In keeping with its Vision and culture, Lonza has continuously encouraged employee participation in thecompany through stock ownership. In 2005 the former Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP) was updated.Under the 2005 plan, ESPP Plus, employees were given the opportunity — but not the obligation — to purchaseLonza shares in multiples of three with a price reduction of 30%. The shares purchased in this manner remainblocked for three years and are eligible for a dividend. After this blocking period, participants are entirely free todo as they wish with the shares. If participants keep their shares for a further two years in a blocked deposit,they will then — after this holding period is over — receive one additional free share for every three sharespurchased. Due to cost-saving measures, the reissue of the share purchase plan was interrupted in 2013.
The purchase conditions to participate in the ESPP Plus were as follows:
. 2012: ranging from 9 shares to 318 shares
The ESPP is not part of an incentive program. The plan is intended as a long—term share—savings scheme toprovide employees with an incentive to strengthen teamwork and personal commitment.

Long-Term Incentive (LTIP)
History and Participation
The LTIP is an equity—based plan introduced in 2006 for the Executive Committee and a segment of keyemployees.
Objective
The LTIP has been designed to align the interests of participants with those of Lonza’s shareholders and to serveas a retention tool. LTIP participants are eligible to receive a number of Lonza shares at the end of the vestingperiod, provided that certain challenging performance conditions are met at the end of the three-yearperformance period.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 213
===================================================
215.hocr: 
Equity Awards
Under the LTIP, participants are awarded the right to receive a number of Lonza registered shares in the future.Depending on the level of the job, the target equity award grant is between 10% and 100% of the annual basesalary. The grant is made at target and the payout level can be between 0% and 200%. The Executive Committeemembers, including the CEO, have a target of 100% of base salary with payout levels between 0% and 200%maximum. Any proration is applied in relation to the entire length of the three—year perfonnance period.
The LTIP plan design is determined at the beginning of the three—year performance period. For 2017 the plandesign included minimum, target and stretch goals. The 2017 LTIP budget value for the Executive Committeewas approved as submitted at the AGM 2017 and administered in accordance with this approval.
Vesting will depend on achievement of the performance conditions and cannot exceed the maximum amount(200%) of granted equity awards.
Restriction and Vesting
The central feature of the plan is that key participants will only receive title and ownership of the shares after athree—year vesting period and only if the performance metrics required for vesting are partially or fully met.
Vesting Targets
For the 2017 and 2016 LTIP the performance metrics were CORE EPS and CORE RONOA with 50% weight foreach measure.
With the payout value directly linked to these key financial metrics, these two measures focus on Lonza’sﬁnancial performance that will drive the valuation of Lonza with investors. The value of the LTIP will be
ultimately driven by the share price at the time of payout, further linking the LTIP t0 the interests of the
shareholders.
Overview of Vesting Conditions for LTIP
For the years 2017 and 2016, the vesting of up to 50% 0f the granted equity awards depends on growth of COREEPS achieved during Lonza’s three ﬁscal years and the vesting of up to 50% of the granted equity awardsdepends on growth of CORE RONOA achieved during Lonza’s three ﬁscal years.
Performance Metrics for CORE EPS Approved at AGM 2017 (LTIP 2017)1
- The minimum threshold to be reached at year—end 2019 was determined by the NCC to be significantlyhigher than the CORE EPS achieved on 31 December 2016 (which was CHF 7.81). If this minimum thresholdis not reached, the payout will be zero. If this threshold is reached, 50% 0f the equity awards granted underCORE EPS will vest.
- If the target is reached, 100% of the equity awards granted under CORE EPS will vest. CORE EPS is aninternal, sensitive ﬁnancial target which is not disclosed at this time.
- The maximum was determined to approximate 110% of the CORE EPS at target. If such level of CORE EPS isreached, 200% of the equity awards granted under CORE EPS will vest.

1 As a result of the acquisition of Capsugel, Lonza management deemed that the performance targets previously set in the LTlPs shall be adjusted toreﬂect and consider the Capsugel integration and contribution to the Group's future performance. The ﬁnancial budget information of Lonza (EBIT.Core EBIT, Net Income and Core Net Income) and NOA used in the calculation of the Forecast Information agrees to the Lonza ﬁnancial budgetinformation (EBIT, Core EBIT, Net Income and Core Net Income) and NOA used in the calculation of the original LTIP performance targets for FY18and FY19 as approved by the Board of Directors when establishing the 2016 and 2017 LTIPs. This information has been amended by the ﬁnancialbudget information of Capsugel for FY 18 and FY19 based on the forecasted information derived from calculations in connection with theacquisition. The methodology applied to incorporate the acquired Capsugel business and supporting calculations into the LTIPs has been validatedby an external party.
Treatment of LTIP in Change of Control Situations
Under the LTIP rules, if a Change of Control occurs, all unvested granted shares shall immediately vest and thegranted price shall be the price at which the shares are sold in the transaction resulting in the Change ofControl.
Actual Performance and Payout for the LTIP 2015
The total 2014 LTIP payout equaled 100%.
Performance under the 2015 LTIP exceeded the target for CORE EPS, generating a 200% payout on 50% 0f thetotal award. Performance under the 2015 LTIP exceeded the target for Core RONOA, generating a 200% payouton the remaining 50% of the total award. The total 2015 LTIP payout equals 200%.

Extended Short-Term Incentive Plan (E-STIP)
Relationship to STIP
For the years 2013 and 2014 the company provided the members of the Executive Committee and SeniorManagement with Short—Term Incentive Plans, of which two—thirds is paid in cash (Cash STIP) and one-third inrestriced share units (RSUS) (E-STIP) which vest after three years, Performance metrics are defined for eachﬁnancial year; achievement determines the payout of STIP.

Alignment on Share Price
The value of the plan is strongly dependent on Lonza's future share price, thereby further reinforcing the link toshareholders' interests. The E—STIP is awarded in the form of RSUs, which are subject to a three—year vestingrequirement.
Grant Timing
The grant of the RSUs under the E—STIP 2014 took place in April 2015 following shareholder approval at theAGM (E—STIP 2013 on 31 March 2014), on which date the number of RSUs was determined based on the closingstock price of the last business day in March. These RSUs vest after three years.
Dividend and Voting Rights
The E—STIP RSUs, do not qualify for dividends and voting rights until vested.

Note 29 - Financial Risk Management
29.1 Overall Risk Management Policy
Lonza is exposed in particular to credit and liquidity risk as well as to risks from movements in foreign currencyexchange rates, interest rates and market prices that affect its assets, liabilities, and forecasted transactions.Lonza’s overall risk management policy aims to limit these risks through operational and finance activities.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of Lonza’s riskmanagement framework. Financial risk management is carried out by a central treasury department (GroupTreasury). Group Treasury is responsible for implementing the policy, and identifies, evaluates and hedgesﬁnancial risks in close cooperation with Lonza’s business units. Group Treasury also has the sole responsibilityfor carrying out foreign exchange transactions and executing financial derivative transactions with third parties.
Lonza’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyze the risks faced by Lonza, to setappropriate risk limits and controls, and to monitor risks and adherence to limits. Risk management policiesand systems are reviewed regularly to reﬂect changes in market conditions and Lonza’s activities.
Lonza Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with Lonza’s risk managementpolicies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk management framework in relation to the risksfaced by Lonza. Lonza Audit Committee is assisted in its oversight role by Internal Audit (Lonza Audit Services).Internal Audit undertakes both regular and ad hoc reviews of risk management controls and procedures, theresults of which are reported to the Audit Committee.
29.2 Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁnancial loss to Lonza if a customer or counterparty to a ﬁnancial instrument fails tomeet its contractual obligations, and mainly arises from Lonza’s receivables from customers.
Accounts Receivables
Lonza’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂuenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer. Riskcontrol assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience andother factors. In monitoring customer credit risk, customers are grouped according to their creditcharacteristics, including geographic location, industry, and existence of previous financial difﬁculties.
Purchase limits are established for each customer, which are reviewed regularly. For customers domiciled inspecific countries with high risk, Lonza has credit risk insurance covering the maximum exposure.
The maximum credit risk is equal to the carrying amount of the respective assets. There are no commitmentsthat could increase this exposure to more than the carrying amounts. In general, Lonza does not requirecollateral in respect of trade and other receivables, but uses credit insurance for country risk where appropriate.
Lonza establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of tradeand other receivables. The allowance is based only on the specific loss component that relates to individuallysigniﬁcant exposures. There is no collective impairment recognized

approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have sufﬁcient liquidity to meet its liabilities
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or risking damageto Lonza’s reputation. Group Treasury maintains flexibility in funding also using bilateral and syndicated credit

29.4 Market Risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices will affect Lonza’s income or the value of its holdings ofﬁnancial instruments. Lonza is exposed to market risk from changes in currency exchange and interest ratesand commodities. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposureswithin acceptable parameters, while optimizing the return on risk. Lonza has established a treasuly policy ofwhich the objective is to reduce the volatility relating to these exposures. Lonza enters into various derivative
transactions based on Lonza’s treasury policy that establishes guidelines in areas such as counterparty exposureand hedging practices. Counterparties to agreements are major international ﬁnancial institutions with at
least investment grade rating. Positions are monitored using techniques such as market value and sensitivityanalyses. All such transactions are carried out within the guidelines set by the Audit Committee.

Foreign Exchange Risk
The Group operates across the world and is exposed to movements in foreign currencies affecting the Groupﬁnancial result and the value of Group equity. Foreign exchange risk arises because the amount of localcurrency paid or received for transactions denominated in foreign currencies may vary due to changes inexchange rates (transaction exposures) and because the foreign currency denominated financial statements ofthe Group’s foreign subsidiaries may vary upon consolidation into the Swiss—franc—denominated GroupFinancial Statements (translation exposures). Foreign exchange risks arise primarily on transactions that aredenominated in USD, EUR and GBP.
In managing its exposure regarding the ﬂuctuation in foreign currency exchange rates, Lonza has entered into avariety of currency swaps and forward contracts. These agreements generally include the exchange of onecurrency against another currency at a future date. Lonza adopts a policy of considering hedging for all thecommitted contractual exposure. The planned exposure is hedged within certain ranges. Hedge ratios aredetermined by the risk committee and depend on market expectation, risk bearing ability and risk appetite.
The table below shows the impact on post-tax profit if at 31 December a currency had strengthened (+) orweakened (—) versus the Swiss franc, with all other variables held constant as a result of the currency exposuresoutlined in the tables below:

Interest Rate
Risk arises from movements in interest rates which could affect the Group financial result or the value of Groupequity. Changes in interest rates may cause variations in interest income and expense. In addition, they mayaffect the market value of certain ﬁnancial assets, liabilities and hedging instruments. The primary obj ective ofthe Group’s interest rate management is to protect the net interest result.
Lonza’s policy is to manage interest cost using a mix of fixed and variable rate debt. Group policy is to maintainat least 50% of its borrowings in fixed-rate instruments. In order to manage this mix in a cost—efﬁcient manner,Lonza enters into interest rate swaps and cross—currency interest rate swaps to exchange at speciﬁed intervals,the difference between fixed and variable interest amounts calculated by reference to a corresponding notionalprincipal amount. Lonza adopts a policy of having one-third of the debt on a short-term basis and two-thirds ofthe debt on a long—term basis. The mix between ﬂoating and fixed rates depends on the market view of Lonza.
Lonza’s exposure to interest rate risk was as follows:

million CHF 2017 2016Net debt (see note 15) 3,762 1,584Net debt at ﬁxed interest rates 1 (2,396) (1,374)Interest risk exposure 1,366 210

1 Including effects from cross-currency interest rate swaps
If the interest rates had increased /decreased by 1% in 2017, with all other variables held constant, post-taxproﬁt would have been CHF 11.3 million lower / higher (2016: CHF 1.7 million lower / higher).
Commodity Price Risk
Lonza needs liqueﬁed petroleum gas (LPG) as raw material for a cracker in Visp. Butane, naphtha or propanecan be used as feedstock for the cracker. The raw material ultimately used depends on its availability andspeciﬁcations. The annual demand is approximately 110,000 metric tons. In order to minimize the risk ofhigher raw material prices, Lonza hedges the commodity price risk Via swaps. At 31 December 2017, if thepropane / naphtha price had weakened / strengthened by 10%, with all other variables held constant, othercomprehensive income would have been CHF 2 million lower / higher (2016: CHF 2 million lower / higher).
29.5 Overview of Derivative Financial Instruments
The following table shows the contract or underlying principal amounts and fair values of derivative ﬁnancialinstruments by type of contract at 31 December 2017 and 2016. Contract or underlying principal amountsindicate the volume of business outstanding at the balance sheet date and do not represent amounts at risk. Thefair values are determined by using the difference of the prices ﬁxed in the outstanding derivative contractsfrom the actual market conditions which would have been applied at the year-end if we had to recover thesetrades.

Offsetting of Financial Asset and Financial Liabilities
The Group enters into derivative transactions under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (ISDA)master netting agreements with the respective counterparties in order to mitigate counterparty risk. Under suchagreements the amounts owed by each counterparty on a single day in respect of all transactions outstanding inthe same currency are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable by one party to the other. The ISDAagreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the balance sheet as the Group does not have a currentlyenforceable right to offset recognized amounts, because the right to offset is only enforceable 0n the occurrenceof future events, such as a default or other credit events.
The following table sets out the carrying value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments and the amounts that aresubject to master netting agreements.

29.6 Financial Instruments Carried at F air Value
The Group applied the following hierarchy for determining and disclosing the fair value of financial instruments
by valuation technique:
- Level 1: quoted (unadjusted) prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,
either directly or indirectly.
. Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

On the Pharma&Bi0tech side, Lonza and Capsugel teams joined together for the first time publicly in late 2017in Frankfurt at the Convention of Pharmaceutical Ingredients (CPhI), the largest pharmaceutical trade show inthe world. Our core message at CPhI was that Lonza can enable their customers from start to ﬁnish — from earlymedicine development and clinical trials all the way to commercialization and beyond. Customers in the pastwould have had to use multiple suppliers to achieve what Lonza and Capsugel can now offer together — fromdrug substance and formulation to final dosage form.

Lonza is party to certain contingent consideration arrangements arising from business combinations. The fairvalues are determined considering the expected payments. The expected payments are determined byconsidering the possible scenarios of forecast gross proﬁt and sales, which are the most signiﬁcant unobservableinputs. The estimated fair value would increase if the forecast gross profits and sales were higher. At 31December 2017 the total potential payments under contingent consideration arrangements could be up to CHF19 million (2016: CHF 30 million), primarily related to the InterHealth Nutraceuticals Inc acquisition. Based onInterHealth's 2017 performance no payment will be required and the contingent consideration liability has beenadjusted accordingly.
29.7 Carrying Amounts and Fair Values of FinancialInstruments by Category
The carrying values less impairment provision of trade receivables are assumed to approximate to their fairvalues due to the short-term nature of trade receivables. The fair value of ﬁnancial liabilities for disclosure
purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash ﬂows at the current market interest rate that isavailable to the Group for similar financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows. The fair
value of forward foreign exchange contracts is determined using quoted forward exchange rates at the balancesheet date.

29.8 Capital Management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and marketconﬁdence and to sustain future development of the business. The Board of Directors monitors both thedemographic spread of shareholders and the return on capital, which Lonza deﬁnes as total shareholders’equity, excluding non—controlling interest, and the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders.
The Board seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels ofborrowing and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position. Lonza’s target is to achieve areturn on invested capital of between 10% and 15%; in 2017, the return was 9.7% (2016: 12.7%). In comparison,the weighted average interest expense on interest—bearing borrowings (excluding liabilities with imputedinterest) was 1.6% (2016: 1.6%).
From time to time, Lonza purchases its own shares on the market; the timing of these purchases depends onmarket prices. Primarily, the shares are intended to be used for issuing shares under Lonza’s share programs.Lonza does not have a deﬁned share buy—back plan.
Neither Lonza Group Ltd nor any of its subsidiaries is subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Highlighting Our Initiatives in 2017Making New Acquisitions
During 2017 Lonza also extended our offerings and services in several core areas through bolt-on acquisitions:
- Expertise in autologous cell— and gene—therapy manufacturing with the acquisition of thu'maCell B.V. (NL),which allows Lonza to be the only CDMO to offer an international cell and gene therapy manufacturingnetwork, spanning the United States, Europe and Asia.
- Addition of early—phase clinical manufacture capacity from the acquisition from Shire plc of a clinical—stagemammalian manufacturing site in the United States, which allows us to address increasing demand forclinical—stage current Good Manufacturing Practice (cGMP) manufacturing capacity.
. To establish Lonza as the global leader in micronization of active ingredients for the pharma and finechemical industries, we supplemented Capsugel’s existing micronization center in Pennsylvania by acquiringMicro—lvlacinazione (MicMac) in August. A Swiss—based global pioneer of jet mill equipment formicronization, MicMac is one of Europe’s leading contract micronization providers.

Our responsibilities under those provisions and standards arefurther described in the Auditor‘sResponsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report.

E Revenue recognltlon
Key Audit Matter
Lonza's recognition oi revenue in a complete andaccurate manner is exposed to various risks. There aretwo distinct risk factors that trigger revenue recognitionas a key audit matter:
' custom manufacturing agreements in thePharma & Biotech segment, and
- linkage of certain of management‘s incentivecompensation to annual revenue targets.
Due to current market forces, the relevance of long-term product supply agreements with Lonza's Pharma& Biotech customers continues to increase. Underthese agreements, Lonza constructs and launches newor reworked suites dedicated to ciient specificmanufacturing, which are owned and operated byLonza. Extending over multiple periods suchagreements often combine milestone and upfrontpayments during a construction phase. the rendering ofproject management services and the delivery ofgoods. To a certain degree the identiﬁcation 01 thesedifferent components as separable revenue streams aswell as their relative fair value is subject tomanagement’s judgment and interpretation of thecustomer contract. This gives rise to the risk thatrevenue could be misstated due to the incorrectidentification, separation and valuation of componentsresulting in an inappropriate timing 01 revenuerecognition.
Lonza regularly publishes forecasted ﬁnancial resultsPerformance targets embedded in management’s shortand Iong-term compensation incentive plans based ontargeted results and achievement of such targets arepartially contingent on the timing of revenuerecognition. There is a risk of fraud in revenuerecognition due to the incentives management may feelto achieve the forecasted results
Our response
For significant new or amended customermanufacturing agreements in the Pharma & Biotechsegment we assessed the appropriateness oi theidentification, separation and valuation of contractelements and the timing of revenue recognition bymaking our own independent assessment, withreference to the relevant accounting standards.Furthermore, we challenged and assessed thequalification 01 separable components of significantnew contracts and their valuation with Lonzamanagement.
As a response to the risk of iraud in revenuerecognition, we penorrned substantive sample testing01 revenue recorded during the year and focused onrevenue transactions taking place beiore and afteryear-end as well as biII-and-hold transactions todetermine that revenue was recognized in the correctperiod. We tested the accuracy 01 the sales recorded,based on inspection oi customer acceptanceoerttiicates‘ shipping documents and delivery notes.Furthermore. we have assessed the appfopriatenessoi management’s response to indications of improperrevenue recognition, tested manual journal entries ona sample basis and tested controls over the recordingoi revenue in the reievant IT systems.
We also assessed the adequacy of the revenuerecognition disclosures contained in accountingprinciples and in the note addressing informationabout reportable segments.

g Accounting for the Capsugel S.A. acqulsltion
Key Audit Matter
On 5th of July 2017, Lonza acquired CapsugelS.A.(“Capsugel) for a total consideration of CHF 3.4billion in cash In addition, Lonza assumed Capsugel’sdebt 01 CHF 2 blllion which was refinancedsubsequently.
As part of the acquisition accounting, InternationalFinancial Reporting Standards require the recognitionand measurement of the identiﬁable assets acquiredand liabilities assumed at their fair values. As a resultLonza recognized goodwill of CHF 2.4 billion,representing the difference of the total considerattonpaid and the fairvalue of Capsugel's net assets.
Identifying and assessing the fair values 01 the assetsacquired and liabilities assumed requires managementiudgement. In particular, the valuation of intangibleassets such as customer re|ationships, technology andthe acquired trade name, which amount to CHF 2.7billion are based on estimates made by Lonzamanagement.
In determining the fair vaIues of these intangible assets,Lonza management engaged specialists who apptied avaluation model that incorporates. amongst others,assumptions in respect of future revenues and margins,useful lives, customer attrition, royalty rates anddiscount rates.
Our response
We read the Capsugel purchase agreement tounderstand the key terms and conditions of thetransaction and their implications on the accounting,We agreed the consideration paid to the agreementand bank statements.
Regarding the identiﬁcation and valuation of intangibleassets, we involved our own valuation specialists.They supported us in gaining sufficient evidence overthe adequacy ot valuation methodologies and theassumptions used. As part of these procedures, weconsidered and challenged the appropriateness 01 themethodology underlying the fair value estimation 01 theidentiﬁed intangibles assets. Amongst others wefocused on the remaining useful lives, and reviewedthe attrition rate assumptions, where relevant, findingthem to be in an acceptable range. As part of ourprocedures, we challenged the underlying businessplan, its derivation and respective assumptions, andcompared it, where available, to relevant benchmarks.
We atso consxdered the adequacy of the disclosuresfor the Capsugel acquisition in the consolidatedfinancial statements.

Income taxes
Key Audit Matter
Lonza Group operates across a number of different taxiurisdictions (primarily Europe, the US and China)giving rise to a high level of cross-border transactionsand complex taxation arrangements being subject tovarious country specific tax laws. During the normalcourse of business local tax authorities may challengefinancing arrangements between Lonza entities,transfer-pricing arrangements relating to the Group'smanufacturing and supply chain and the ownership ofintellectual property rights.
Lonza recorded the estimated Impacts oi the US. TaxCuts and Jobs Act 01 2017 as well as changes inBelgian tax law in 2017. The U.S. and Belgian taxreforms had a significant impact on Lonza’s income taxrelated financial statement accounts, resulting in a netincome tax benefit of CHF 187 million. The short tlmeperiod available. due to the late December 2017enactment. to implement the changes related to theUS. Tax Relorm required assumptions and estimatesof certain input factors, which involved judgment bymanagement. These judgments and estimatesincluded accounting for the estimated US. tax ondeemed repatriated earnings of Lonza‘s non-U.S.subsidiaries, the adju stment ofdeferred tax items at thelower enacted corporate tax rates and other estimatedeffects of a territorial tax based system.
The Group has also recognized provisions againstuncertain tax positions, the estimation 01 which issubiect to management‘s judgement.
Judgment is also required in the recognition andmeasurement oi deferred tax assets. which result fromlosses brought forward.
Our response
Our audit approach included the use of local taxspecialists in all key jurisdictions to evaluate taxprovistons and potential exposures tor the year ended31 December 2017. In response to the US. andBelgian tax reforms, we assessed Lonza's estimatesassociated with the calculation of deemed repatriatedearnings. As part of these procedures, we agreedforeign taxes paid and other inputs to previously filedtax terms or returns and reviewed the company‘sassumptions and methodology used in determining itsestimates relative to the provisions of the newlyenacted law. We challenged the Group’s assumptionsand judgments through our knowledge 01 Lonza's taxstatus circumstances and the enacted laws‘
We obtained explanations lrom managementregarding the known uncertain tax positions andanalyzed existing correspondence with taxationauthorities to identify uncertain tax positions. Weassessed the adequacy 01 management's taxationproviSlons by considering country speciﬁc direct taxrisks, transler-pricing risks, compliance risks andpotential penalties and tines. We challenged andevaluated the judgements made by management inassessing the quantification and likelihood atsignificant exposures and the level of liability requiredfor specific cases.
In respect of deferred tax assets, we have consideredthe appropriateness of management's assumptionsand estimates. We have assessed management'sview of the likelihood of generating suitable luturetaxable proﬁts to support the recognition of deferredtax assets This included our consideration at whetherinternal budgets and management assumptions fortheconcerned legal entities support the relatedconclusions.
Furthermore, we evaluated whether the inwme taxrelated items including the related estimatesassociated with the U13. and Belgium tax reforms wereappropriately disclosed in the consolidated linancialstatements.

In preparing the consolidated financial statements, the Board of Directors is responsible for assessing the Group'sability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using thegoing concern basis of accounting unless the Board of Directors either intends to liquidate the Group or to ceaseoperations. or has no realistic alternative but to do so‘
Auditor's Responsibilities tor the Audit at the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the CDnSOIIdEIed financial statements as a wholeare free from material misstatement, whether due tofraud or error. and to issue an auditor‘s reportthat includes ouropinion Reasonable assurance Is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted inaccordance with Swiss law, ISAs and Swiss Auditing Standards will always detect a material misstatement when itexists, Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis ot theseconsolidated ﬁnancial statements

CORE Results
Lonza believes that disclosing CORE results of the Group’s performance enhances the ﬁnancial markets’ understanding ofthe company because the CORE results enable better comparison across years.
CORE results exclude exceptional expenses and income related to e.g. restructuring, environmental—remediation,acquisitions and divestitures, impairments and amortization of acquisition—related intangible assets, which can differsigniﬁcantly from year to year. For this same reason, Lonza uses these CORE results in addition to IFRS as important
factors in internally assessing the Group’s performance.

Compensation and Performance Overview2017
Lonza’s compensation philosophy is designed to attract and retain talent through competitive compensationprograms. Lonza's compensation programs are performance based, linking employee rewards with companyand individual performance. Executive compensation is aligned with the short—term and long—term objectives ofLonza; results are measured based on achievement of speciﬁc goals that are aligned with the short-term andlong—term objectives. Our performance goals are selected to achieve a balance between desired short—term andlong—term outcomes. In this way, we encourage strategic decisions for competitive advantage and discourageexecutives from taking unnecessary or excessive risks that would threaten the reputation or sustainability of theCompany. The ﬁnancial impact of the Capsugel integration was excluded from the CORE results which arerelevant for the STIP payout and LTIP vesting.
For 2017 Lonza’s overall financial performance vs. short—term incentive plan (STIP) targets was as follows:

2. Compensation Components
The compensation of Lonza employees includes the following components (total compensation):
Base Pay
The base pay of Lonza employees is established by assessing the scope of the job within the context of therelevant market, as well as individual performance. The base pay should be in general comparable with themedian of similar positions in the pharmaceutical, chemical and general industries. Potential increases in basepay are evaluated on a regular basis and are typically based on relevant market economic developments,benchmarks and the employee’s performance.
Variable Compensation
The variable compensation is designed to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in thecompany’s overall success and earn a competitive total compensation. The majority of employees participate ina short—term incentive plan (STIP). Senior management and key employees also participate in a long—termincentive plan (LTIP).

This increase in its entirety is due to the improved businessperformance and underlines the sustained overall performance of the past years and is attribuable to theincrease of the number of Executive Committee members in 2017.
The number of LTIP Equity Awards decreased in 2017 (2016: 18,872 versus 2017: 17,805) due to an increase inshare price on the date of grant of CHF (2016: CHF 156.30 and 2017: CHF 180.90).

LTIP participants are eligible to receive a number of Lonza shares at the end of the vestingperiod, provided that certain challenging performance conditions are met at the end of the three—yearperformance period.

===================================================
296.hocr: 
Vesting will depend on achievement of the performance conditions and cannot exceed the maximum amount(200%) of granted equity awards.
Restriction and Vesting
The central feature of the plan is that key participants will only receive title and ownership of the shares after athree-year vesting period and only if the performance metrics required for vesting are partially or fully met.
Vesting Targets
For the 2017 and 2016 LTIP the performance metrics were CORE EPS and CORE RONOA with 50% weight foreach measure. For more details, see note 25 in the Financial Report.
With the payout value directly linked to these key financial metrics, these two measures focus on Lonza’sfinancial performance that will drive the valuation of Lonza with investors. The value of the LTIP will be
ultimately driven by the share price at the time of payout, further linking the LTIP to the interests of the
shareholders.
Overview of Vesting Conditions for LTIP
For the years 2017 and 2016, the vesting of up to 50% of the granted equity awards depends on growth of COREEPS achieved during Lonza’s three ﬁscal years and the vesting of up to 50% of the granted equity awardsdepends on growth of CORE RONOA achieved during Lonza’s three ﬁscal years.
Performance Metrics for CORE EPS Approved at AGM 2017 (LTIP 2017)1
. The minimum threshold to be reached at year—end 2019 was determined by the NCC to be significantlyhigher than the CORE EPS achieved on 31 December 2016 (which was CHF 7.81). If this minimum thresholdis not reached, the payout will be zero. If this threshold is reached, 50% of the equity awards granted underCORE EPS will vest.
- If the target is reached, 100% of the equity awards granted under CORE EPS will vest. CORE EPS is aninternal, sensitive ﬁnancial target which is not disclosed at this time.
- The maximum was determined to approximate 110% of the CORE EPS at target. If such level of CORE EPS isreached, 200% of the equity awards granted under CORE EPS will vest.

Addressing the Rapid Growth of Megacities
Movement of populations from rural areas to megacities is generating a need for many Lonza products andservices, including the use of nutritional supplements to support good health and an active lifestyle.
Growing populations within megacities are triggering needs for simple yet effective hygiene products to combata broad range of pathogens, including particular bacteria and viruses that are often present in healthcarefacilities. Around the globe our sanitizers and disinfectants are used in hospitals and other medical settings,industrial cleanrooms, homes, restaurants and institutional food—preparation facilities, schools, ofﬁces, gymsand cruise ships.
We are also innovative leaders in addressing the sustainability of an ever-more—populated earth. Our Coatingsand Composites products, for example, help conserve energy by making aircraft, automobiles and satelliteslighter and stronger, by reducing fouling on ocean—going ships to improve fuel efﬁciencies and reducemaintenance costs, and by improving yields in the production of shale, oil and gas.
Wood is one of the world’s most Vital, renewable, natural resources that can support the growth of megacities.Our technologies enable the use of wood products for critical construction and infrastructure needs throughoutthe world. We offer ﬁre—protection and mold—control technologies for the treatment of wood materials used incommercial construction, including nursing/retirement homes, high—rise apartments and condominiums,schools, hospitals, etc. Also we deliver durable and reliable preservative treatments that protect wood used inthe installation and expansion of railroads and utility lines.
In a growing number of cities worldwide, engineered wood is being used in high-density construction joints,joists, timbers and beams in addition to steel and concrete construction. We at Lonza have pioneeredtreatments that add a preservative and water—repellent propexty to our customers’ engineered timbers, as wellas products that combine fungicides and insecticides to protect this wood from insects and decay.
The threat of ﬁre in densely developed cities helps explain the growing use of our fire-retardant treatments forwood used in schools, apartment complexes, homes, train stations, hospitals and other areas.
In crowded urban areas such as megacities, green-thinking municipalities and industries are conservingprecious water resources by treating and recycling wastewater so that it can be used for other purposes. Lonzaprovides sanitizers and organic coagulants that treat the water and reduce the amount of sludge, which in turnmeans less waste disposal.

Addressing the Growth of Middle Classesin BRIC and VISTA Countries
The growing middle classes in BRIC and VISTA countries are generating increasing demand for medication,healthy food and nutrition, hygiene, personal care, and efficient yet sustainable solutions for housing and living— all supplied by Lonza.
With modern facilities in Singapore and China, Lonza's Pharma&Biotech segment is capitalizing on risingdemand in Asia Pacific and elsewhere for medicines and biotech therapies. A major objective of governmentsand industry in emerging countries is to provide their sizeable populations with affordable treatments.
Rising demand for nutritional supplements and personal-care products also can be seen in BRIC and VISTAcountries. Brazil’s youthful population, for example, is eager for healthful nutritional supplements; so it wasrewarding that our Consumer Health and Nutrition business won a trade show innovation award there for aformula that contains both Lonza’s Carnipure® L-Carnitine and caffeine in a tailored Capsugel dosage form.
Growth in these emerging middle classes is creating needs for improved hygienic standards and convenience —needs that can, for example, be met by such products as Lonza’s fast—acting, broad—spectrum disinfecting wipes.Approved for healthcare settings, food—handling facilities and homes, these handy wipes are engaged in front—line battles against a broad spectrum of harmful viruses and bacteria, including the often difﬁcult-to-addresssources of hospital-acquired infections.
Many of the BRIC and VISTA nations are in hot, humid areas of the planet. This fact underscores the value ofour Coatings and Composites business, which helps customers fight mold that contributes to the so—called sick—building syndrome by providing protective biocides and fungicides for paints, wallboard, ceiling tiles,adhesives and other building products.

Capitalizing on Cross—Business Synergies
Lonza is thriving today and will gain even more competitive advantages going forward because we excel attransferring knowledge, experience, technology and best—in—class practices across our businesses.
The quest to capitalize on cross—business synergies is embodied in the challenge that our CEO has issuedrepeatedly in recent years — “If Lonza only knew what Lonza knows!”
Applying Knowledge Across the Businesses
We are bridging the gaps in knowledge between businesses, functions and technologies in many ways, includingsimple things such as using electronic laboratory notebooks that can be broadly accessed by Lonza researchersso that they can benefit from each others’ work. As another example, we have deployed a new global qualityorganization that will make it easier to share quality, error prevention and regulatory excellence practices acrossthe entire company.
The value of cross—business synergies is vividly apparent in two vital goals of the Capsugel integration: togenerate CHF 100 million in additional, synergistic sales per year by 2022 and CHF 30 million in operationaland CHF 15 million in tax savings by 2020. We are already well on track toward achieving those goals.

Exploiting Capsugel's Innovative Dosage Forms
Scientists are sharing expertise to apply Capsugel’s leading capsule and delivery technologies to Lonzaingredients for both the pharma and the consumer health and nutrition markets, At a major trade show in 2017in Las Vegas, NV (USA), for example, customers were introduced to 10 new consumer health and nutritionproducts that feature Lonza ingredients in tailored Capsugel dosage forms. Among others these cross—businessofferings included Lonza’s Carnipure® free-ﬂowing L-Carnitine metabolism nutrient essential for energymetabolism in Capsugel’s liquid—formulated DUOCAP®, Licaps®, beadlet-in-caplet and multi—particulate forms.
Lonza collaborates with consumer healthcare brand customers to drive innovation, creating new applicationsfor existing technologies. Our Melt Spray Congealm (MSC) technology, for instance, was developed to controlthe release proﬁle of biopharmaceutical actives. Now, however, we are applying the same technology tonutritional ingredients, where we replicate the timed-release effect for ready-to-drink beverages.
Capitalizing on the demand for both clean label and healthy aging choices, Lonza-Capsugel has launched theliquid—filled Plantcaps® technology. For the ﬁrst time, customers with branded products are able to deliverorganic, nutritional oils to consumers in a convenient, plant—based, more—natural capsule
Within the Pharma&Biotech segment, Capsugel’s focus on oral and nasal dosage forms has nicelycomplemented our Drug Product Services’ focus on parenterals, which involves drugs for delivery via injectionor implantation. This range of delivery methods is highly complementary for all molecule types.
Opening a Portal to Sales Across Pharma&Bi0techand Consumer Health Businesses
The Pharma&Bi0tech businesses are collaborating to capitalize on the “portal” that the Bioscience Solutionsbusiness provides in terms of being a vital entry point to cross—business sales. Bioscience Solutions' clients forour cell culture media, for example, may also need cell therapy, or viral therapy process development andmanufacturing services.
That’s why businesses as diverse as Emerging Technologies and Drug Product Services and functions likeResearch & Development are working with Bioscience Solutions to position Lonza’s broad portfolio of productsand services as “the comprehensive solution” for patient-speciﬁc, cell—based products and related needs.Depending on the customer’s process, they could also utilize Bioscience Solutions' newly launchedNucleofector® 14V.
Consumer Health spearheaded a broad-based assessment to discover and pursue new uses for Lonza BioscienceSolutions’ agarose technology, which has long been a critical technology for electrophoresis and proteinchromatography. The applications now in development range from skin— and hair—care products through tonovel delivery systems. We expect the initial products from this collaboration to launch in late 2018.

Offering Biocide Alternatives to BannedDisinfectants and Preservatives
Lonza's pyrithione chemistry is a sterling example of a proven technology that is used in multiple businessunits. Our Zinc Omadine®, for example, is the world’s leading active anti—dandruff ingredient offeringbactericide-fungicide efficacy out of shampoos, conditioners and leave-on products. Lonza’s ZincOmadine® actives have been providing dandruff relief and improved scalp health for over 50 years.
Tailored versions of our pyrithione chemistry not only protect shower curtains and bath mats from mold andmildew but also are a key active ingredient in marine antifouling paints to deter the growth of barnacles, slimeand other foulants on ships’ hulls and on aquaculture fishing nets.
We also blend pyrithiones along with other actives into our Proxel® family of products that help preserve andprotect architectural paints and coatings. These solutions protect the painted or treated surfaces from blackmold, mildew and other pathogens that are often cited as causes of sick-building syndrome, which includesrespiratory ailments and other illnesses suffered by homeowners, students, nursing home patients, etc. Ourcompounds also protect the in—can paint or coating from bacteria and thereby extend the product’s shelf— and
service—life.
Biocides such as methylisothiazolinone (MIT) and triclosan are increasingly being banned or severely restrictedby health regulatory agencies. Our products, which are widely registered worldwide, are serving as the preferredalternatives to these biocides. In fact, Lonza has become a leading supplier of triclosan—free antibacterial hand—wash technologies in North America.

Yes, we think, Lonza has become stronger than ever. However, our leaders and staff will remain focused onoptimizing further processes and structures to ensure that profitable growth continues well into the future. Thatis why our focus for 2018 will be on thorough execution and efficiency, particularly for Lonza's enablingfunctions — like IT, procurement and finance — which must continue to be modernized and optimized in orderto support the company’s further prosperous growth.
The Healthcare Continuum as Lonza’s Framework
We want to strengthen Lonza’s leading role as a provider of valuable solutions for the global pharmaceutical andconsumer healthcare markets, with a focus on patient health, consumer preventive health and healthyconsumer environment. The “healthcare continuum” describes well how many markets offer growth anddevelopment potential for Lonza, and it also provides a common platform for our different technologies andcapabilities. Markets within the healthcare continuum span all of our Pharma&Biotech and many of ourSpecialty Ingredients businesses — from prescription drugs to personal care and well—being.
Accelerating growth within the healthcare continuum was also at the roots of the decision to acquire Capsugel,the leading provider of innovative dosage forms for the biopharmaceutical and the consumer health andnutrition industries.
The healthcare continuum provides a strategic framework for what we do and what we stand for, and it willcontribute to an even—better recognition of Lonza’s values and ambitions.
Integration Is Essential
Through the acquisition of Capsugel, Lonza added a trusted brand with a large breadth of technologies. WithCapsugel we expanded the market reach of Lonza’s contract development and manufacturing organization(CDMO) and products businesses.
The integration has been progressing smoothly: Employees are already acting as one organization. But we arestill only at the beginning of a long path of fully exploiting all the potential of our combined skills and strengths.
We are well positioned to beneﬁt from the dynamics in our customers' industries and to address the most-interesting technology trends. However, we must continue to work on our goals of establishing an integratedportfolio of industry—leading technologies — from active pharmaceutical ingredients (APIs) through excipients todosage forms and delivery technologies — and of building a leading integrated, value-added solutions providerin drug development, formulation, delivery technologies and manufacturing for the global pharma andconsumer healthcare industries.
We should not overlook the fact that Lonza's family also grew in 2017 with smaller acquisitions: PharmaCell inthe Netherlands, MicroMacinazione in Switzerland, HansaBiomed in Estonia and the Hayward, CA, site in theUnited States. Integration of all these interesting new units is progressing well.

Our Approach to Innovation
We recognize that keeping our pipelines full with innovative products and services that meet customers’emerging and unmet needs requires a disciplined innovation project management (IPM) approach. As part ofthis process, we begin with a Vigorous evaluation of innovation projects through an integrated approach thatinvolves business and marketing leaders, technology reviews and a ﬁnancial overview to determine whether theproj ect is worthy of investment.
The ﬁrst principle of our IPM philosophy is that the project is customer focused and satisﬁes must—have needs.And to ensure that the project remains on target, our approach requires frequent contacts with customers, othermarketplace experts and our own R&D experts so that we can ﬁne-tune the project to respond to any newcustomer concerns or ideas.
Once innovation projects are selected for support, dedicated cross—functional teams work to help with theexecution of the projects, to track their progress against critical milestones, and to otherwise manage andoptimize the innovation portfolio to deliver the expected results and strategic goals. This Vital teamwork isoverseen 011 a daily basis by our Go—to—Market Excellence IPM Steering Committee, which includes key businessportfolio managers and process owners, as well as support services such as R&D and IT experts.

Pharma&Biotech InnovationsInnovating Breakthrough Therapies
Lonza Pharma&Biotech’s Research and Development function is one of the key pillars to position the segmentas a partner of choice for the pharma and biotech industries, Our innovative spirit is captured in the new branddescription of Lonza Pharma&Biotech — Delivering the Medicines of Tomorrow, Today®.
Throughout 2017 we applied our inventive mindset to address the increasing number of medicines that areobtaining breakthrough—therapy designation and other accelerated—approval pathways. Due to the fast—tracktimeline, these molecules require innovative regulatory, development and project-planning solutions. Theexperience needed to deliver these solutions is available from only a few custom development andmanufacturing organizations (CDMOs) in the world, and Lonza is one of them.
Lonza’s Custom Development business is currently working on several products that have breakthrough—therapy designation across multiple technologies. In large—molecule medicines, we have supported 45 percent ofbreakthrough-therapy designation launches. Also in the realm of small molecules, we have supported 36percent of breakthrough—therapy designation medicines. We continually focus on reﬁning our existing tools anddeveloping new tools at each stage of development.
These advances give customers impressive predictive models based on our vast experience to aid technologyselection, which accelerates the transition to ﬁrst-in-human trials and to market. Our offerings have evolved sothat we can now provide an integrated approach from active pharmaceutical ingredient (API) to ﬁnished formand from point of concept to commercialization, which results in a signiﬁcant reduction in the complexity ofdrug programs.
Innovating to Increase Potency and Efficacy
The heavy investment in oncology treatments continues to yield more low—dose/highly potent applications.With our expertise and investments in capacity for highly potent active pharmaceutical ingredients (HPAPI), aswell as the isolation capabilities we have available across all of our drug delivery technologies, we are stronglyaligned to support this trend. In our collaboration with C1 ovis, we are moving toward real—time release testing ofAPIs, a ﬁrst in the CMO pharmaceutical industry, which requires close collaboration with customers and withregulators.

Innovating Nucleofection Services
Lonza is one of the world’s leading providers of advanced nucleofection services and systems that are being usedto help develop cures for diseases at the molecular level by using the breakthrough gene—editing technologiesCRISPR/Casg, TALENs and ZFNs. Nuclcofection is a premiere transfection technology for the non-viralintroduction of DNA and other substrates into primary cells and cell lines, including clinically relevant cells likehuman T—eells.
Used in combination with nucleofection, these innovative gene—editing technologies can generate inducedpluripotent stem cells (iPSCs), which have the ability to self—renew and generate any cell type in the humanbody for use in regenerative medicine, disease modeling and drug development.
Innovating Autologous Technologies
Innovation in the field of cell and gene therapies is transforming the way that patients with cancers and geneticdiseases are treated — or better yet — cured. At the forefront of this revolution are autologous therapies, in whichcells from a specific patient are extracted, processed ex vivo, and then returned to the patient as therapeuticmedicines. Given the small—batch, patient—specific nature of this approach, large—scale production with its costefﬁciencies do not apply.
For that reason it is critical for Lonza to innovate ways in which these therapeutic cures can be supplied. That’swhere the CocoonTM technology, currently under development in collaboration with Octane Biotech, comes in. Itis based on an automated cGMP—in—a—box concept for autologous cell— and gene—therapy manufacturing. Thegoal is to provide a scalable and cost—efficient solution to current autologous cell— and gene-therapymanufacturing bottlenecks.
Lonza‘s breadth of services across the entire biologic product’s lifecycle is based on innovation — from cell-lineconstruction, process development, clinical phase manufacturing and formulation services to full commercialproduction.

Innovating in Consumer Health and Nutrition
In all key aspects, the acquisition of Capsugel in 2017 represented a major step forward for Specialty Ingredientsbusinesses in terms of our ability to offer our customers innovative products and services. With Capsugel we cannow provide integrated product development to clients from active ingredients all the way through to finisheddosage forms.
Capsugel is a real innovative powerhouse with proven engineering and scientiﬁc expertise. For example, in 2017Lonza capitalized on the growing consumer desire for safe, natural products by launching liquid—ﬁlledPlantcaps® technologies. For the first time ever, our customers are able to deliver organic, nutritional oils andother healthful ingredients to consumers in a convenient plant—based, more—natural capsule.
Similarly, our DUOCAP® capsules improve the stability of nutritional ingredients like probiotics that are at thecenter of a digestive-wellness revolution. And our Melt Spray CongealTM (MSC) technology, which was developedto control the release proﬁle of biopharmaceutical actives, is now being applied to nutritional ingredients so thatcustomers can replicate the timed—release effect for ready—to—drink beverages.
In 2017 Lonza’s Consumer Health and Nutrition business enjoyed rapidly growing sales of our innovative,breakthrough joint-mobility product — our proprietary UC-II® undenatured type II collagen. This nutritionalingredient, available in a small daily pill, has been clinically proven to benefit consumers by improving jointmobility. It is a go—to ingredient for leading brands, with dozens of consumer product launches throughout theworld.
Innovating in Personal Care and Hygiene
Because of our innovative chemistry and biotechnology, Lonza is able to offer customers in the personal care,cosmetics, hygiene, paints, coatings and related industries 3 wide range of safe, preferred alternatives to priormicrobial-control ingredients.
For example, hygiene customers are frequently asking for more sustainable, green disinfectants andpreservatives. With quat-based and other widely registered and approved disinfectants, Lonza’s Hygienebusiness has become a leading supplier of triclosan—free antibacterial hand—wash technologies in NorthAmerica. We are addressing this desire with new product development efforts through biotechnology-basedplatforms and readily biodegradable microbial-control solutions.

By having more frequent and informal “Performance Cheek—Ins,” we take thestress out of the typical annual performance conversation and ensure employees are set up for successthroughout the year.
Launching Initiatives for a Smooth CapsugelIntegration
One reason that Lonza was attracted to Capsugel was both companies' have a culture that celebrates andrewards high—performing teams and individuals. In fact, one of the themes of the internal launch of ouracquisition of Capsugel was Bringing T ogether High—Performing Teams.
Integration processes often generate challenges. Colleagues from HR, Talent & Organization Development andthe business integration teams continue to deploy a portfolio of tools to address growing change managementneeds. These resources can be applied to integrating Capsugel and other smaller companies we acquire, as wellas to managing the fast—paced changes that we are facing throughout the company. We are well positioned forthe integration of all our new employees into Lonza.
In 2017 HR formed a Total Rewards team that integrated Compensation and Beneﬁts teams across Lonza andCapsugel. That new dedicated team has been working to strengthen our ability to offer competitive, market-based total rewards by evaluating the terms and conditions of employment globally. In that way HR can betterunderstand the trends and developments in key markets, as well as the skills that will support the businessmore effectively. On a holistic level, HR can ensure that the right policies, compensation, incentives, beneﬁtsand programs are in place and can identify potential areas for improvement, harmonization andstandardization.

For that reason we have been investing in innovative business models and projects like Ibex® Solutionsin Visp (CH), which, by the way, also demonstrates our commitment to strengthen Switzerland as an industrialhub. Continuous facility expansions and upgrades, driven by customer needs, such as the US. sites of Houston,TX; Portsmouth, NH; and Bend, OR, will also contribute to Lonza’s growth. Needless to say, we will continue togrow also by adding bolt—on technical acquisitions wherever we ﬁnd convincing opportunities.
Lonza’s goal is to strengthen our global footprint, also by enforcing our positions outside the company’s already—strong home markets of Europe and the United States, with greater emphasis in South East Asia, SouthAmerica, China, J apan, India, Oceania and South Africa.
We Believe in Industry Responsibility
Lonza not only operates sites worldwide, but also feels responsible for our impact on and relations with the localcommunities where we live and work. Yes, we also take responsibility for our industrial heritage, asdemonstrated by our continued progress in Visp (CH) on remediating the mercury situation.
We want our sites to make further progress toward comprehensive environmental and health protection andsafety at work, and we do not shy away from higher ambitions than merely complying with legal standards.Sustainability and corporate social responsibility continue to be high on our agenda going forward.
Our sites should become good ambassadors of the healthcare continuum!
How We See 2018 to 2022
Based on the foundation laid in the past, and with the new baseline including Capsugel, we already announcedour outlook for 2018, i.e.:
- Mid—single—digit sales growth on a comparable basis in line with Mid—Term Guidance 2022- 100 bps improvement in CORE EBITDA margin in line with Mid-Term Guidance 2022
Lonza’s activities within the healthcare continuum are expected to grow above average while optimizations inparts of the Lonza portfolio will continue.
Delivering on this outlook for 2018 will be a further step toward our Mid—Term Guidance 2022, disclosed in thehalf—year presentation in July 2017:
. Sales CHF 7.5 billion' CORE EBITDA margin 30%- CORE RONOA 35%
Such an improvement of Lonza's performance will certainly be a welcome present for the company's 125thanniversary in 2022.
Measuring ﬁnancial returns on Lonza’s investment will be more ambitious in 2018, as we intend to replaceCORE RONOA (return on net operating assets) by the ROIC (return on invested capital) concept,

Protecting Our Stakeholders
“Vision Zero” — the ethical principle that underscores all our efforts in the realm of the environment, health andsafety (EHS) — sets the ultimate goals of achieving zero injuries, zero manufacturing process incidents, zerodistribution incidents and zero environmental incidents. It is at the heart of our EHS policy, wherein Lonzacommits to operations and practices that prevent harm to people and damage to the environment or property.Our principles for environment, health, safety and security set forth in the policy and resulting from thecompany's ethical conviction take precedence and apply throughout Lonza.
Whereas the EHS policy deﬁnes the high-level principles, our corporate EHS management system consisting of22 detailed guidelines supports their implementation. Six of our corporate guidelines are considered critical,and they get enhanced selective attention during our internal comprehensive EHS audits. They include activitiessuch as working from heights; protecting workers against unexpected fall risks; entering conﬁned spaces; andpreventing any exposure of employees to harmful, toxic or asphyxiating atmospheres while working in egress-restricted environments.
Our Central Process Safety department — part of the corporate EHS group — whose expertise helps keep ourprocesses safe, made further progress in 2017 in supporting the manufacturing sites The department is workingclosely with the sites in the implementation of the internal rules and standards for process safety to which
all are obliged to adhere. Numerous site visits across the world with in—person exchange of advice and expertknowledge drive safe operation to excellence — a prerequisite for our license to operate.
Our EHS group also oversees our company—wide sustainability efforts. The continuous—improvement tools anddisciplines that drive improved safety and environmental quality are also applied to making sustainable use ofnatural resources, reducing our carbon footprint, minimizing hazardous waste and managing remediationactivities responsibly, as well as otherwise improving the quality of life for our stakeholders.
EHS risk assessments serve as valuable tools in our business and operating practices and in our planningprocesses. We review new ventures, capital investments in production equipment and systems and other majorprojects not only for the business opportunities they present, but also for their environmental, health and safetyimpact.

EHS Performance
The year 2017 marked further signiﬁcant progress in safety as we achieved the lowest rate in Lonza history oflost—time injuries and illnesses (LTIFR) per one million hours worked of 0.54 (on a historically comparablescope, not including the Capsugel acquisition). Even when integrating Capsugel into the rate calculation, Lonzastill delivered a previously unmatched rate of 0.73. Broadly speaking, Lonza has halved the incident rate for safeworking from 2016. Our reporting year’s performance marked a satisfying step on our Safety 2020 Campaign —whose goal is a frequency rate of LTIFR of not more than 06 incidents per one million hours worked, which wealready surpassed in 2017.
The year 2017 closed without any material incidents or breakdowns of manufacturing operations, nor werethere any severe incidents or damage inﬂicted on the environment in connection with the transportation ofLonza products and raw materials. Nevertheless, we routinely test and maintain our corporate emergencycommunication system, as well as the local site emergency response systems to prepare us to keep harmfuleffects to a minimum and crisis situations under control.
We are aware of the challenge we face to deliver future safety records and live up to our set goals. Therefore, wefocus on continuously improving personal and behavioral safety to build on and strengthen our safety culture,which has a long and successful history in Lonza. Safety at work is a core responsibility of each and every leaderand employee; and the culture to live up to “Vision Zero” is a central element in Lonza’s leadership, proj ectmanagement and team cooperation.
Training initiatives continue to reinforce the learning effects by reviewing every safety incident — includingchallenging the assumptions about causes and remedies. We conduct monthly global conferences to widelyshare the results of safety incident reviews to foster awareness and to apply insights gained to identical orsimilar challenges elsewhere. And we continue to strengthen our capacity and expertise in process safetymanagement and implementation in order to further minimize the risks inherent to the chemical processesrunning in our installations.
The ultimate goal of our safety culture remains to ensure that at the end of a working day, every employeereturns home safely and unharmed to their families and friends. “Vision Zero” will be our guide.
The table below summarizes key environmental and resource intensities. In order to continue comparabilitywith previous year's data, the scope excludes the mid—2017 acquisition of Capsugel.

Chemicals Management
Lonza’s product formulation skills, wide product—regulatory assurance and global regulatory expertise provideus distinct competitive advantages in a world of increasingly strict chemical management assurance.
One challenging program is the European Registration, Evaluation, Authorization and Restriction of Chemicals(REACH) initiative. To ensure continuing compliance and business, Lonza is in the process of registering allcovered substances imported, manufactured and marketed in the European Union. New substances areregistered before reaching the 1 ton per year (tpa) threshold. Preregistered phase-in substances (mainly existingsubstances listed in the European Inventory of Existing Chemical Commercial Substances or EINECS) areregistered in a tiered process based on volume and substance properties.
To date, Lonza has successfully registered all ﬁrst—tier and second—tier chemicals. Registrations 0f third—tierchemicals (>1 tpa) are ongoing and are scheduled to be completed before the 31 May 2018 deadline.
The REACH regulation sets a number of new and challenging requirements with respect to the use of chemicalsubstances. Manufacturers or importers have to demonstrate the safe use of a substance for all of its identifieduses. The uses are communicated and accessible to businesses and the general public.
At Lonza a team of more than 60 regulatory experts at locations in Europe, the Americas and Asia Pacific serveand support Lonza businesses globally to ensure compliance with existing regulatory requirements and to stayabreast of future requirements. T heir expertise is also a great value to customers who incorporate our regulatedingredients in their end-use applications.

EHS Commitment
Lonza commits considerable resources to EHS activities. At the end of the reporting year, approximately 200people worked in the core EHS ﬁeld. EHS operating costs amounted to CHF 59 million in 2017, 3.4% up on theprevious year. Capital expenditure on EHS was CHF 43 million, equivalent to 0,9% of sales and 11% 0f theGroup’s total investment in ﬁxed assets.
About two thirds of the EHS capital expenditure in 2017 was absorbed by the large chemical andpharmaceutical manufacturing complex at Visp and the related infrastructure. Most prominent were the pre—investment related to the planned new Ibex® manufacturing complex, the replacement of electroﬂlters in thesolid and liquid residual waste incineration plant to allow a continued state-of—the-art highly efﬁcient operation,besides the revamping of a plant complex where ammonia recovery, the breakdown of non—biodegradables andwastewater extraction activities take place. An investment into a significant improvement to avoid emissionsfrom process wastewater collection and pretreatment basins was realized and leads to a sustained reduction ofodor emissions while setting an even higher standard to safeguard against potential groundwatercontamination.
Numerous EHS—related capital was spent on projects at other sites in 2017, including signiﬁcant warehousesafety upgrades at the French water site in Amboise, and at the biopharmaceutical activities in Porriﬁo (ES).Further projects included safety upgrades at the US. site in Rockland, ME, and in Rochester, NY.
Corporate Responsibility
Providing transparent evidence of corporate sustainability practices is part of our commitment to excellence.Most of this information is shared on our corporate website; and in addition, we disclose climate data andactivity assessments in the framework of the Carbon Disclosure Project for the beneﬁt of our stakeholders andas an active participant in the UN Global Compact foundation. We also participate in and respond to a variety ofcustomer and supplier targeted sustainability assessments and surveys.
As a company that makes pharmaceuticals, personal—care products, nutritional ingredients, drinking watersanitizers and hygiene disinfectants, we are sensitive to concerns about the use of animals to test the safety ofthese products for human use or consumption. Whenever possible, we do our utmost to promote the use ofalternatives to animal tests; but in many cases, we are required by law and regulations to conduct such tests.Such required testing is conducted by external, state-of—the-art laboratories that Lonza approves and audits.
Lonza is accredited by the Association for Assessment and Accreditation of Laboratory Animal Care because weapply high standards for the humane care and use of laboratory animals. The company is also recognized by theUS. National Institutes of Health Ofﬁce of Laboratory Animal Welfare and complies with the Public HealthService Policy on Humane Care and Use of Laboratory Animals.

Industrial Heritage at the Swiss Manufacturing Site
In 2017 Lonza’s large site in Visp (CH) made progress as planned to address mercury contamination around awastewater discharge canal (“Grossgrundkana ”), on surrounding soil near the canal and in certain other areaswhere canal sediments were deposited as ﬁll many decades ago. This industrial legacy traces back to whenLonza used large amounts of mercury as a catalyst in chemical processes, and the site discharged industrialwastewater with mercury containing efﬂuent into the canal between 1930 and the mid—197os.
Various parties were involved in the maintenance of the publicly owned canal by dredging and excavatingsediments from the waterway. At times when neither the awareness nor the environmental legislation was ontoday's level, parts of the removed material were used as ﬁll material on various land properties. Only duringthe 19705 did the communities and the people become aware of the full problem in connection with mercury. In1976 Lonza commissioned our wastewater treatment plant, where mercury-containing efﬂuent hassubsequently been treated.
Since 2013 Lonza has worked closely with the communities in preﬁnancing all required technical investigationsin residential areas and agricultural zones between Visp and Niedergesteln (CH).
While 2016 marked the demonstration of the effectiveness of the chosen and approved approach when twocontaminated areas were selected and remediated in a pilot project, the year 2017 was the year of readiness forthe large-scale remediation in the residential areas. Lonza ﬁnally obtained the consent of the competentcantonal and communal authorities and all concerned land owners; and ﬁrst remediation activities started inNovember 2017.
In December 2017 Lonza, the Canton of Valais and the concerned municipalities signed an agreement about therepartition 0f the investigation and remediation costs. The agreement includes the commitment that privatelandowners of parcels to be remediated will not be held ﬁnancially liable for the costs incurred. This
agreement marked a breakthrough moving forward the Upper Valais mercury remediation process. During2018 we will see a big step toward complete remediation when the activities will be in full swing.
Neither historically nor in the recent past have adverse health effects to humans or animals been linked to themercury contamination found in the investigated region — as was conﬁrmed in an independent epidemiologicalstudy by the University of Zurich (CH), which was conducted through 2015. The study concluded that noevidence for adverse health effects exists.
Lonza, the Canton of Valais, the municipalities and other parties involved are working hard to efﬁciently resolvethe mercury—related industrial heritage in the perimeters of concern.

Goals
The 2016-2020 medium-term sustainability goals, which were endorsed by Lonza’s executive management in2015, became effective with the beginning of the reporting year 2016.
These medium—term goals include a 40% reduction of the 2015 safety target of the former cycle and a 10%reduction of environmental and resource rates achieved by the end of 2015, The decision to apply relative goals(rates on sales) was made on the basis of the challenges related to the business portfolio and the asset portfoliothat lie ahead.
These goals include direct (scope1) and indirect (scope2) greenhouse gas emissions (GHG), other establishedlead parameters for air emissions, as well as the resources—related parameters of energy and waterconsumption. The GHG goal 2020 has been adjusted to updated indirect C02e scope-2 emission factors forvarious regional energy grids during 2017 (goal was reduced from 166 t/mn to 161 t/mn).

Air impurities, totaling 690 metric tons in 2017, were 12% down on the previous year. Primarily responsible for this signiﬁcant decrease was emissioncontrol equipment at Visp including 74% lower halogenated VOC emissions. VOC and nitrogen oxides (NOX) were responsible for 83% of all airimpurities. Technical improvements at emission points have been realized in recent years and contributed to the reductions. VOC emissions aremainly the result of solvent use in product manufacturing, cleaning and maintenance processes. Halogenated VOC made up 6% of total VOC andLonza continues to minimize their consumption where possible.

Creating Value Through ResponsibleSourcing
Lonza’s global Procurement team proved the value of our close partnerships with major suppliers worldwideand our robust supply chains in the face of some practical challenges in 2017. These hurdles included workingaround a railroad blockage in Germany that affected our site in Visp (CH) and responding to chemical supplychains disrupted by major hurricanes in the United States. These operational issues were resolved thanks to the
teams with no material impact on the company's overall performance.
Drawing on a broad global base, the procurement teams played a vital role in oost—effectively supporting morethan 50 manufacturing and R&D sites worldwide with the raw materials, services and other support theyneeded to excel and grow in 2017.

Competitive external supplies
In 2017 Procurement worked closely with the businesses to increase the savings performance by roughly 30%compared with the previous year across almost all external-spend categories, These savings are Vital to Lonza’scompetitive position and proﬁtability.
Together with stakeholders from the different businesses, Procurement develops strategies for spend categoriesfor a diverse range of strategic raw materials and services. The team also uses enhanced analytics and reportingof key raw-material price variances, as well as future price projections, to help our businesses make timelychoices. Our risk analysis process also enables us to identify high—risk materials and take adequate mitigationactions.
In tight alignment with our business leadership and value—chain management professionals, Procurement in2017 successfully launched a breakthrough initiative known as DIVER — Drive and Improve Vendor Results.This initiative is reassessing almost CHF 1 billion of Lonza's external spend to reallocate expenditures to themost beneﬁcial suppliers and to generate other efficiencies. Further significant financial savings are expectedgoing forward.
Surety of external supplies
Each year the Procurement team must respond to everything from unexpected disruptions to rising costs forVital raw materials to assure reliable and affordable external supplies. Beyond this year's hurricanes and railsupply disruptions, the team successfully navigated several unexpectedforce majeure events at some major
suppliers.
The Procurement team also helped our businesses cost—effectively cope with the trend of rising costs for globalcommodities, including basic chemicals in Europe, where deindustrialization is forcing companies like Lonzaeither to pay higher costs from the dwindling number of European suppliers or to seek new suppliers in Asiaand the Americas. Our professionals secured favorable pricing and terms by leveraging our volumerequirements, by capitalizing on close strategic partnerships with existing suppliers and by integrating newsuppliers into our supply chain.
Supporting business growth
Procurement helped facilitate Lonza’s growth in serving the strategic healthcare continuum markets bydirecting growing demand to the right sourcing market segments, by identifying new supply sources and byscaling up existing sources. For example, the team stepped up support to Pharma&Biotech while we built astrong pipeline of growth initiatives, as well as to the newly created Consumer Health and Nutrition divisionthat combines both Capsugel and Lonza offerings.
In 2018 Procurement will be focusing on achieving our vision of a One Purchasing Community that featuresgreater coordination with local sites and business sourcing so that, where possible, we can centralize purchasingto drive competitiveness and strengthen supplier relationships and logistic networks.

Responsible sourcing
Suppliers to Lonza must adhere to the requirements defined in Lonza's Supplier Code of Conduct. This codedeﬁnes standards of business ethics, as well as labor, health, environmental and safety practices. We routinelyconduct audits of suppliers to monitor adherence to this code. These strict ethical requirements are of utmostvalue when sourcing compliant materials for medicines and therapies, as well as natural and organic ingredientsfor consumer health and nutrition products.
Looking ahead, Procurement will continue to focus on value-added activities, strategic partnerships inside andoutside Lonza, and the search for business opportunities wherever they might arise — all aimed at assuring abest—in—class procurement function.

Quality Initiatives
Driving a Proactive Quality Culture ThroughHuman—Performance Management
We at Lonza are absolutely committed to our reputation as an innovative leader in quality performance withinall of our offerings along and beyond the healthcare continuum. J ust as in the realm of workplace safety,achieving superior quality requires constant Vigilance and rigorous continuous improvement programs andprocesses

In 2017 our major manufacturing sites in Portsmouth, NH (USA), Singapore (SG), Porrino (ES), Visp (CH) andNansha (CN) and Slough (UK) successfully passed strict regulatory audits. Those audits were just 15 0f the 25successful regulatory inspections conducted at our Pharma&Bi0tech sites worldwide. Our Pharma&Biotechnetwork worldwide also underwent 135 customer audits; and here, too, we have successfully addressedcustomer concerns and observations. And where we face quality challenges, such as at our site in Walkersville,MD (USA), we provide teams of experts to assist the site.
We recognize that human performance is a key factor for superior and sustainable quality. Indeed, many of theprocess—related deviations across the biopharmaceutical industry are currently attributed to human errors,which impact safety, quality and security of supply.
Lonza Annual Report 2017 69
===================================================
71.hocr: 
The Error Prevention System (EPS) is built on the backbone of our Operational Excellence program. Each is aVital parts of Lonza’s global quality initiative, whose aim is to engage all employees in systemic thinking andachieving excellence in all that we do throughout Pharma&Biotech businesses, sites and functions, We have asimilar, quality-focused initiative in our Specialty Ingredients businesses, many of whom also face strictregulatory requirements for ingredients intended for human health, hygiene and wellness.
Our Error Prevention System, launched in 2014, engages operators and other experts to establish error-proofstandard operating procedures, work instructions and batch records, as well as learning and qualificationmodules. It also harnesses automation where possible to simplify operations and to ensure vital equipment isoperating at optimal levels.
For example, EPS and other quality initiatives have reduced deviations across all Lonza Pharma&Bi0tech sitesworldwide from 2014 to 2017 by approximately 50% — at the same time, production output increased around30%. Of greater importance, customers are impressed by the EPS program delivering often-dramatic reductionsin manufacturing issues related to their products.
To get human performance to the next level, best practices throughout the Lonza network are embraced andleveraged as standardized processes and trainings. As an example, the Lonza Pharma&Biotech Academygoverns harmonization of training curricula and makes sure that training delivery follows state—of—the—artlearning methodologies in order to ensure quality at source, which is one of Lonza‘s
Pharma&Biotech strategic pillars.
The bottom line, however, comes through seeing tangible improvements — site to site and across theorganization. Evidence shows that human performance efforts are preventing negative outcomes by powerfullyengaging operators and others in proactive and preventive efforts that create a more positive workingenvironment. The ultimate objective of these efforts is to enhance patient health and safety by manufacturingproducts of the highest quality for the healthcare continuum markets.

Refurbishing a Rural School in J amaica
Early in the year, Lonza Water Treatment‘s Surface Water group partnered with their customers to renovate andimprove the Woodlands Basic School in a remote, impoverished community of Montego Bay in J amaica. Thisproject was a part of the annual PEACHTM charitable outreach work performedjointly between Lonza and ourcustomers.
The goals of our PEACHTM projects (People Extending a Caring Hand) are to give Lonza customers andemployees the opportunity to improve the lives of others and in doing so to strengthen the ties between us.
Before the group even arrived, local contractors, sponsored by Lonza, built an addition to the school. Theaddition included a new roof that enclosed a courtyard for additional classroom space. Once the preparationswere complete, 31 volunteers arrived to donate their time and eﬂorts toward an extensive makeover thatincluded beautifying the new classroom, installing doors and windows, installing a water tank that will allowthe children to have continuous access to clean water, and assembling and painting new picnic tables for thechildren to enjoy their tropical surroundings.
The volunteer work took place during the group’s annual retreat, a rewards trip for the top professionalapplicators who use Applied Biochemists® products. This rewards program allows Lonza to connect directlywith the customers using our products — the customers who treat toxin—producing algae and cyanobacteria indrinking water reservoirs or who help to eliminate the nuisance weeds that block irrigation canals. Inaddition to the volunteer work, the team gathered for a business meeting,featuring updates from Lonzatechnical experts. The group also donated school supplies to the 30 children of Woodlands Basic School. Thechildren range in age from 2 to 6 years old.

Cleaning the Path to a Healthier Future
Uganda, as one of the poorest countries in the world, is in dire need of sanitaiy improvements. Under a three-year project known as Sanitation for Africa, Lonza Water Treatment is teaming up with the non-governmentalorganization Clean Habitat Uganda to provide our HTH Scientific® sanitizer tablets for use in pit latrines in thatAfrican nation. Clean Habitat Uganda will distribute our sanitizing tablets to communities serving 5,000homes.
Since the kick-off in 2015, the proj ect has evolved and is continuously expanding its reach into the communities.
Pit latrines, also known as outhouses or long drops, serve as household or even community toilets and are an
ideal breeding ground for disease and virus-bearing mosquitoes, ﬂies, cockroaches and other insects. One ortwo (depending on the pit size) of our sanitizing tablets, comprised of dry calcium hypochlorite, are placedinto each latrine, where they help combat bacteria,foul odors and insect growth, which in turn helps tocontrol diseases that can be carried by the insects.

Financial HighlightsOverview
Lonza’s 120th anniversary year in 2017 was characterized by record—breaking full—year results, which includeddouble-digit organic sales growth, organic CORE EBITDA and CORE EBIT growth well above sales growth andan attractive CORE RONOA of 28.3% for Lonza standalone.
We exceeded our full—year 2017 guidance and demonstrated our strong organic growth potential. Having closedthe acquisition of Capsugel 0n 5 July 2017, Lonza consolidated Capsugel for nearly six months in 2017. Lonzareported sales of CHF 5.1 billion (Lonza standalone CHF 4.6 billion) for the full-year 2017, a 23.5% increase inreported currency compared with the same period in 2016 (Lonza standalone 10.4% sales growth in reportedcurrency).
Margins for Lonza further improved. resulting in a record—breaking CORE EBITDA margin of 24.8% (23.9%Lonza standalone) and CORE EBIT margin of 18.8% (18.0% Lonza standalone) in reported currency.
Net debt as a consequence of the Capsugel acquisition ended 2017 at CHF 3.8 billion. which resulted in a netdebt/CORE EBITDA (proforma) ratio of 2.65>< — a leverage level significantly below the previouslycommunicated threshold of up to 3x net debt/CORE EBITDA. The ratio was also supported by the strongoperational free cash ﬂow of CHF 619 million before acquisitions.
Our outstanding organic sales growth and high margin improvement demonstrate Lonza’s robust operationalperformance and commercial excellence. Pharma&Bi0tech and Specialty Ingredients contributed to the record-breaking full—year results with offerings along and beyond the healthcare continuum as growth drivers. Withless than six months on our books until the end of the reporting year.

Highlights 2017
Our Mammalian Manufacturing business experienced strong performance across our global manufacturingnetwork in 2017, as we focused on continuing current levels of utilization and profitability. Strong demand inMammalian Manufacturing was one of the key drivers in the Pharma&Biotech segment’s sales growth.
In 2017 Lonza manufactured complex bulk drug substance for approximately 22 commercial large moleculemedicines. We continued to beneﬁt from a balanced customer portfolio, ranging from large pharmaceuticalcompanies to emerging biotech enterprises. The outsourcing and dual—sourcing trends in the industrymaintained a positive and healthy momentum.
To meet and anticipate strong demand in the commercial outsourcing market, we continue to invest intechnology, processes and assets. These activities include expansion of the Ibex® biomanufacturing complexlocated in Visp.
Ibex® Solutions offer a modular, technology—independent development and manufacturing facility capable ofsupporting activities across multiple technologies — mammalian, microbial, cellular or bioconjugate — and fromlate discovery to development and commercial manufacturing. It is expected to reduce time-to-market forLonza’s customers by 12 months or more, de—risk their strategic investment decisions and allow them to beneﬁtfrom Lonza’s expertise and service network in Visp.
Several hundred new positions are expected to be created on Lonza’s 100,000 in2 (1,076,391 sq feet) brownfieldsite there. Construction began in June 2017; the first groundbreaking took place in September 2017‘
First long—term contracts for Ibex® have been secured. As announced in February 2017, we entered into astrategic partnership with Sanofi by establishing a joint venture to build and operate together a large-scalemammalian cell culture facility for monoclonal antibody production.
Then in September we signed a strategic agreement with Portola Pharmaceuticals to manufacture AndexXa®product at our innovative Ibcx® facility.
Already in 2018 we have added 2,000L single—use bioreactors in Singapore that could further address theincreasing need for ﬂexible volume and more limited patient demand, as in the case of orphan drugs.
These new endeavors have demonstrated our strong commitment to provide innovative, tailored solutions forour clients to improve their ﬂexibility and strengthen their value chain and lifecycle management in a dynamicbusiness environment.

Highlights 2017
The reporting year saw buoyant demand for our CMM services, reﬂected in a high level of bookings, reachinginto the medium term. Sales of recently launched products provided signiﬁcant momentum. Chemicalmanufacturing was one of the key drivers behind the strong results returned by the Lonza Pharma&Biotechsegment in 2017.
We strengthened the pipeline for development services, which led to further new product introductions at allchemical assets. Production of materials that require high—containment facilities continues to grow faster thanthe rest of our CMM business.
Another key highlight of the year was sustained investment in innovative business models, such as the start ofconstruction of a mono-plant (dedicated API manufacturing plant) for Clovis in Visp (CH). Such projects are
driven by customer demand and afford security of supply while allowing for ﬂexibility to adapt to the changingneeds of the product lifecycle.
In August 2017 we acquired Miew—Macinazione SA, based in Molinazzo (CH). As a market leader in themicronization of APIs and excipients, Micro-Macinazione extended our capacity for particle engineering inEurope. In combination with the Quakertown, PA (USA), micronization services from the Capsugel acquisition,Lonza now holds a leading position in contract micronization, which plays well to the market need to addressbioavailability and solubility challenges. We are strongly positioned to provide a seamless service in micronizedAPI production supporting customers globally from our European and US. facilities.

Innovation and Initiatives
Maj or initiatives in the reporting year included ongoing development and adaptation of our business models tooffer innovative solutions. The key factor here is responding to customers’ needs, such as an increased focus onadded value to strengthen market presence. Three examples of this innovation are listed below:
1. During 2017 we invested in constant innovation in manufacturing processes to ensure ﬂexibility at all times inorder to deliver products to our customers faster and to meet demand increases. In our collaboration withClovis, we are moving toward real—time release testing of APIs, a first in the CMO pharmaceutical industry,which requires close collaboration with customers and with regulators.
2. Additionally, Lonza leveraged our unique capabilities to develop an innovative “Fix and Flex” business modelto enable our customers to achieve ambitious growth targets. “Fix and Flex” allows our customers to ensure thesecurity of supply and guaranteed access to assets they need. The business model allows them to ﬁx a certaincomponent of their supply needs while retaining their ﬂexibility to adjust the capacity according to the changingneeds of their product. We have received positive feedback and already have several examples of Fix and Flexset-ups in our portfolio.
3. Our initiative on early intermediates enabled us to back-integrate to cover products previously sourced fromAsia, which addressed compliance and risk management issues. This initiative is driven by innovation intoprocess design, leveraging the strength in depth we have in chemistry at the Visp site (CH).
In J anuary 2018 Pharma&Bi0tech was reorganized into a Biologics Division and a Chemical Division. Duringthe restructuring Lonza CMM became the new Chemical Division with two business units: API Developmentand Manufacturing, and Dosage Forms and Delivery Systems. Lonza's microbial manufacturing
business transitioned from the Chemical Division to the Biologics Division.
Furthermore, the integration of our small—molecule API business with Capsugel’s drug formulationdevelopment capabilities aims to overcome our customers‘ key challenges of complexity, bioavailability,solubility and high potency, while helping shorten lead times for drug launches. Capsugel's pharma capsulesbusiness will remain a separate unit within Lonza's Pharma&Biotech segment, and all teams are working closelytogether to ensure we best serve our customers.
