BASIS OF PREPARATION
Statement of compliance

BASIS OF PREPARATION - CONTINUEDUse of estimates and judgements - ContinuedMeasurement of fair values
A number of the Group‘s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial andnon-ﬁnanciaT assets and Tiabihties.
The Group has an established contra] framework with respect to the measurement of fair vaTues. This incTudes a vaTuat-ionteam that has overaTT responsibih'ty for an signiﬁcant fair vaTue measurements, including LeveT 3 far vaTues, and reportsdirectly to the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer.
The vaTuation team reguTarTy reviews significant unobservable inputs and vaTuation adjustments. If third partyinformation, such as broker quotes or pricing services, is used to measure fair values, then the valuation team assessesand documents the evidence Obtained from the third parties to support the concTusion that such vaTuations meet therequirements of FRS, including the level in the fair value hierarchy in which such valuations should be classified.
Signiﬁcant valuation issues are reported to the Group‘s Audit Committee.
When measuring the fair vaTue of an asset or a TiabiTity, the Group uses observabTe market data as far as possibTe.Fair vaTues are categorised into different Tevels in a fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuationtechniques as f0110ws:
. Level 1: quoted pnces (unadjusted) i'n active markets for identical assets or Tiabﬂities.
. LeveT 2: inputs other than quoted prices incTuded 1n Leve] 1 that are observabTe for the asset or Tiabih’ty, eitherdirectly he as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
- Level 3: inputs for the asset or Tiabﬂity that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the date of the statementof financial position, that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets andTiabﬂities within the next ﬁnanciaT year are discussed beTow.
Impairment of nan-ﬁnancial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment for an noniﬁnanciaT assets at each reportingdate Non-ﬁnanciaT assets are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may notbe recoverabTe.

BASIS OF PREPARATION - CONTINUED
Use of estimates and judgements - Continued
Key sources of estimation uncertainty - Continued
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets - Continued
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cash ﬂows from theasset or cash-generating unit (“CGU”) and choose a suitable discount rate in order to ca1cu1ate the present vaTue of those
cash ﬂows. Further detaiis of the key assumptions apphed in the impairment assessments of the noniﬁnanciai assetssubjected to assessment are disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements as follows:
- Exp10ration and evaTuation assets Note 4- Other intangible assets Note 5- Subsidiaries Note 7- Jointly controlled entities Note 9o AvaiTabTe-for-saie investments Note 10
Amortisatian of technology assets
Technology assets are amortised on a straightiiine basis over their estimated useful lives. Management estimates theusefLﬂ lives of these assets to be within 10 years. Changes in the expected Tevei of usage and technobgical deveTopments00qu impact the economic useful lives and the residual values of these assets, and therefore future depreciationexpenses could be revised. The carrying amounts of these assets are disclosed in Note 5 to the financial statements.
Amartisatian of exploration and evaluation assets
Where an oi] resen/e is either in or commences production, expioration and evaiuation assets are amortised over theestimated life of the relevant areas of interest according to the rate of depletion of the economicaﬂy recoverable reservesof the life of the area. A reguiar review is undertaken of each area of interest to determine the appropriateness ofcontinuing to carry forward cost in reTation to that area of interest.
The production period is based on management’s judgement of when it wiii no Tonger be commerciaﬂy viabTe to extractmore oil or gas, which is highly dependent on the future oil price, production costs, and the technical feasibility forextraction. The carrying amounts of these assets are disciosed in Note 4 to the financiaT statements.
Provisions
Estimates of the Group‘s obligations arising from exploration drilling rehabilitation that exist as at the reporting datemay be affected by future events which cannot be predicted with any certainty. The assumptions and best estimatesin determining these provisions are made based on management‘s judgement and experience and therefore, futureeprra‘n‘on driTTing rehabilitation obhgations and expenses (:0qu be revised. The carrying amounts of the Group'sprovisions at the reporting date are disciosed in Note 19 t0 the ﬁnanciaT statements.

Information about critical judgements in applying accounting poiicies that have the most significant effect on theamounts recognised in the ﬁnanciai statements are discussed beiow.
Classiﬁcation of investments
During the year, the Group assessed the terms and conditions of the shareholders agreement of subsidiaries that are notwhoTTy-owned by the Group, jointiy cbntroiied enti’n'es, associate and avaiiabTe-for-saie investments. Information aboutcriticai judgements in appiying accounting policies in assessing the ciassiﬁcation of investments is disciosed in theﬂnanciai statements as follows:
. Jointly controlled entities Note 9- Avaiiabie-for-saie investments Note 10
Business combinations
An acquisition of a business, which is determined as an integrated set of activities and assets that are capable of beingconducted and managed for the purpose of providing a return directly to investors, is a business combination.
Determining whether an acquisition meets the deﬁnition of a business combination requires judgement to be appliedon a case by case basis. Acquisitions are assessed under the reievant FRS criteria to estabiish whether the transactionrepresents a business combination or an asset purchase. Depending on the speciﬁc facts, acquisitions of exploration andevaluation licences for which a deveiopment decision has not yet been made, have largely been concluded to representasset purchases.
Exploration and evaluation expenditures
The appiication of the Group‘s accounting policy for exploration and evaluation expenditure requires judgementto determine whether it is iikeiy that future economic beneﬁts are iikeiy. from future either expioitation or saie. orwhether activities have not reached a stage which permits a reasonabie assessment of the existence of reserves. Thedetermination of reserves and resources is itseif an estimation process that requires varying degrees of uncertaintydepending on how the resources are classified, These estimates directiy impact when the Group defers exploration andevaluation expenditure
The deferral poiicy requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions as to future events andcircumstances, in particuiar, whether an economicaiiy viabie extraction operation can be estabiished. Any such estimatesand assumptions may change as new information becomes available. If, after expenditure is capitalised, informationbecomes available suggesting that the recovery of the expenditure is uniikeiy, the relevant capitaiised amount is writtenoff in proﬁt orioss in the period when the new information becomes avaiiabie.

Hydrocarbon reserves are estimates of the amount of 011 that can be economically and Tegaﬂy extracted by the Group inapproved ﬁe1ds. For the purpose of esﬁmating reserves, several factors are considered, among others, such as geomgiea],technical and economic, production techniques, recovery rates. production costs,transportat1'on costs, demand and pricesfor commodities and exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and grade of reserves requires determining the size, shapeand depth of the reservoirs 0r ﬁers to be determined by anaTysing geoTogicaT data and dn'Th'ng sampTes. This processmay require interpreting complex and difﬁcult geological judgements. Because the economic assumptions change fromperiod to pen‘od and the Group is stiﬂ generating additionaT geoTogicaT data dun‘ng the course of operations, esﬁmates ofreserves may change from period to period, Changes in reported reserves may affect the recovery of the carrying amountof 011 properties due to changes in esﬁmated future cash ﬂows and the cost of depreciation recorded in proﬁt or Toss as itis given in terms of units of production based on tota] proven reserves.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these financialstatements, and have been applied consistently by Group entities, except as explained in Note 2.5 to the ﬁnancialstatements, which addresses changes in accounting policies.
Basis of consolidationBusiness combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method in accordance with FRS 103 BusinessCombinations as at the acquisition date, which is the date on which control is transferred to the Group.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts related to the settlement of preexisting relationships.Such amounts are generally recognised in profit or loss.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the date of acquisition and included in theconsideration transferred. If the contingent consideration that meets the definition of a ﬁnancial instrument is classiﬁedas equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise. subsequent changes to the fairvalue of the contingent consideration are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Nonecontrollihg interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of theacquiree‘s net assets in the event of liquidation are measured either at fair value or at the nOh-controlling ihterests’proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree‘s identifiable net assets, at the date of acquisition.The measurement basis taken is elected on a transaction-by-transaction basis All other non-controlling interests aremeasured at acquisitionedate fair value. unless another measurement basis is required by FRSs.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Groupincurs in connection with a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Changes in the Group‘s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions withowners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill and no gain or loss is recognisedin proﬁt or loss. Adjustments to non-controlling interests arising from transactions that do not involve the loss of controlare based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary.
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to,variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over theentity‘ The ﬁnancial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements from the date thatcontrol commences until the date that control ceases.
The accounhng policies of subsidiaries have been changed when necessary to align them wtth the policies adopted by theGroup. Losses applicable to the nonecontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the nonecontrolling interests evenif doing so causes the non'controlling interests to have a deficit balance

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES — CONTINUEDBasis of conso‘lidation - ContinuedAcquisitions from entities under camman control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the centre] of the shareholder thatcontrois the Group are accounted for as if the acquisition had occurred at the beginning of the eaﬂiest comparative yearpresented or, if Tater, at the date that common control was established; for this purpose comparatives are restated. Theassets and Tiabiiities acquired are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in the Group controilingsharehoidel’s consolidated financia] statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities are added to the samecomponents within Group equity and any gain/Toes arising is recognised directly in equity.
Loss of control
Upon the Toss of control, the Group derecognises the assets and Tiabiiities of the subsidiary, any non»contr01hhg interestsand the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deficit arising on the loss of control isrecognised in proﬁt or Toss. If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measuredat fair value at the date that centre] is lost. Subsequentiy, it is accounted for as an equityiaccounted investee or as anavailabTe-for-sale ﬁnancial asset depending on the Tevel of inﬂuence retained.
Investments in associates and jointly controlled entities (equity-accauntea’ investees)
Associates are those entities in which the Group has signiﬁcant inﬂuence, but not control or joint control over thefinancia] and operating policies of these entities. Significant inﬂuence is presumed to exist when the Group holds 20%or more of the voting power of another entity. A jointly controiied entity is an arrangement in which the Group has jointcontrol, whereby the Group has rights to the net assets of the arrangement, rather than rights to its assets and obiigationsfor its Tiabﬂih’es.
Investments in associates and jointly controﬂed entities are accounted for using the equity method. They are recognisedinitially at cost, which ihciudes transaction costs. Subsequent to initiai recognition, the consohdated ﬁnanciai statementsinciude the Group’s share of the proﬁt or Toss and other comprehensive income of equityiaccounted investees, afteradjustments to aTigh the accounting poiicies with those of the Group, from the date that signiﬁcant inﬂuence or jointcontrol commences until the date that significant inﬂuence or joint control ceases.
When the Group‘s share of Tosses exceeds its interest in an equity-accounted investee, the carrying amount of theinvestment, together with any Tongaterm interests that form part thereof, is reduced to zero, and the recognition of furtherTosses is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has an obiigation to fund the investee's operations or has madepayments on behaif 0f the ihvestee.
Joint operations
A joint operation is an arrangement in which the Group has joint control whereby the Group has rights to the assets,and obh‘gations for the Tiabihties. reiating to an arrangement. The Group accounts for each of its assets, Tiabﬂities andtransactions, incTuding its share of those held or incurred jointiy, in reTation to the joint operation.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES — CONTINUEDlm pairmentNan-derivative ﬁnancial assets
A ﬁnancial asset not carried at fair value through proﬁt orloss, including an interest in an associate and jointly controlledentity, is assessed at the end of each reporting pen'od to determine whether there is objective evidence that it isimpaired. A financial asset 1's impaired 11‘ objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initialrecogm'h‘on of the asset, and that the loss event has an impact on the estimated future cash ﬂows of that asset that canbe estimated reliably.
Objective evidence that ﬁnancial assets (including equity securities) are impaired can include default or delinquency bya debtor, restructuring of an amount due to the Group on terms that the Group would not consider otherwise, indicationsthat a debtor or issuer will enter bankruptcy, adverse changes in the payment status of borrowers or issuers 1n the Group,economic conditions that correlate with defaults or the disappearance of an active market for a security. In addition, for aninvestment in an equity security, a slgniﬁcant or prolonged decline in its fair value below its cost is objective evidence ofimpairment. The Group considers a decline of 20% to be significant and a period of m'ne months to be prolonged.
Loans and receivables
The Group considers evidence of impairment for loans and receivables at both a speciﬁc asset and collective level. Allindividually signiﬁcant loans and recel‘vables are assessed for speciﬁc impairment. All individually signiﬁcant receivablesfound not to be speciﬁcally impaired are then collectively assessed for any impairment that has been incurred but not yetidentiﬁed. Loans and receivables that are not individually signiﬁcant are collecﬁvely assessed for impairment by groupingtogetherloans and receivables with similar n'sk characteristics.
In assessing collective impairment, the Group uses historical trends of the probability of default, the ﬁming of recoveriesand the amount of loss incurred, adjusted for management‘s judgement as to whether current economic and creditconditions are such that the actual losses are likely to be greater or less than suggested by historical trends.
An impairment loss in respect of a ﬁnancial asset measured at amortised cost ls calculated as the difference betweenits carrying amount and the present value of the estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the asset’s original effectiveinterest rate. Losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss and reﬂected in an allowance account against loans and receivables.Interest on the impaired asset continues to be recognised. When the Group considers that there are no realistic prospectsof recovery of the asset, the relevant amounts are wn'tten off. If the amount of impairment loss subsequently decreasesand the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, then thepreviously recognised impairment loss is reversed through proﬁt or loss.

Impairment losses on availableeforesale financiaT assets are recognised by reciassifying the losses accumulated in thefair value reserve in equity to profit or Toss. The cumuiative loss that is reciassiﬁed from equity to proﬁt or loss is thedifference between the acquisition cost, net of any principa] repayment and amortisation. and the current fair vaiue, lessany impairment Toss recognised previously in proﬁt or loss. Changes in cumuiative impairment provisions attributabie t0appiicat'ion 0f the effective interest method are reﬂected as a component of interest income.

The amount of thereversal is recognised in proﬁt or Toss. However, any subsequent recovery in the fair vaTue of an impaired availableeforisaleequity secunty is recognised in other comprehensive income.
Illan-ﬁnancial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non»financia1 assets, other than inventories, are reviewed at each reporting dateto determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverableamount is estimated. For goodwiii, and intangible assets that have indeﬁnite useftﬂ Tives or that are not yet avaiiabie foruse, the recoverable amount is estimated each year at the same time, An impairment loss is recognised if the carn/ingamount of an asset or its reiated CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount.
The recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to salt Inassessing vaiue in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present vaTue using a pre-tax discount ratethat reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset or CGU. For thepurpose of impairment tesh’ng, assets that cannot be tested individuany are grouped together into the smaiiest group ofassets that generates cash inﬂows from continuing use that are Targeiy independent of the cash inﬂows of other assetsor CGUS. Subject to an operating segment ceiiing test, for the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to whichgoodwiii has been aiiocated are aggregated so that the Tevei at which impairment testing is performed reﬂects the Towestlevel at which goodwili is monitored for internaT reporting purposes. Goodwili acquired in a business combination isaTTocated to groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Impairment Tosses are recognised in proﬁt or Toss. Impairment Tosses recognised in respect of CGUS are aﬁocated ﬁrst toreduce the carrying amount of any goodwﬂl allocated to the CGU (group of CGUS), and then to reduce the carrying amountsof the other assets in the CGU (group of CGUS) on a pro rata basis.

Tax expense comprises current and deferred ta><. Current tax and deferred tax 1‘s recognised in proﬁt or loss except to theextent that it re1ates to a bustness combination, or items recognised dtrecﬁy in equity or in other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable 0r receivab1e on the taxab1e1'ncome 0r1oss for the year, using tax rates enacted 0rsubstantively enacted at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 11ab1'h't1'es forﬁnancial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes
Deferred tax is not recognised for:
- temporary differences on the initial recognition of assets or habih‘t'ies in a transaction that is not a businesscombinatwn and that affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt orloss; and
- temporary d1'fferences re1ated to investments in substdian’es. assoctates and jointty controﬁed entities to theextent that the Group is able to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable thatthey w1'11 not reverse in the f0reseeab1e future.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there 1's a legally enforceable ﬁght to offset current tax Habﬂities andassets, and they re1ate to income taxes 1ev1'ed by the same tax authority on the same taxab1e entity, or on different taxentities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabﬂittes wﬂl berealised simu1taheousty.
A deferred tax asset is recognised for unused tax losses, tax credits and deductible temporary differences, to the extentthat it is probab1e that future taxab1e proﬁts wﬂ1 be avaﬂab1e against which they can be utih'sed.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and are reduced to the extent that it 1‘s no longer probabte that therelated tax beneﬁt wt‘lI be reah'sed.
In determining the amount of current and deferred tax, the Group takes into account the impact of uncertain tax positionsand whether additions] taxes and interest may be due. The Group believes that its accruals for tax liabilities are adequatefor all open tax years based on its assessment of many factors, induding interpretations of tax law and prior experience.This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions and may involve a series of judgements about future events. Newinformaﬁon may become avaﬂatﬂe that causes the Group to change its judgement regarding the adequacy of existing taxh’abﬂities; such changes to tax habih’ties wﬂ] impact tax expense in the pen‘od that such a determination is made.

When the Group adopts SFRS(I) in 2018, the Group W111 appTy SFRS(I) 1 with 1 January 2017 as the date of transition forthe Group and the Company. SFRS(I) 1 generaTTy requires that the Group apph'es SFRS(T) on a retrospective basis, as if suchaccounting poh'cy had always been apph'ed. If there are Changes to accounting policies arising from new or amendedstandards effective in 2018, restatement of comparaﬁves may be required because SFRS(I) 1 requires both the openingbalance sheet and comparative information to be prepared using the most current accounting policies. SFRS(I) 1 providesmandatory exceptions and optionaT exemptions from retrospective apphcation, but these are often dtfferent from thosespecific transih'on provisions in individual FRSS applied to the FRS ﬁnanc1a1 statements, The changes affecting the Groupare desenbed beTow‘

PROVISIONS — CONTINUEDExploration drilling rehabilitation
The rehabih‘tah’on provision represents the present va10e of the cost of rehabﬂitaﬁhg and decommissioning 011 ﬁe1d assetsand infrastructure such as wens, pipehnes and processing facﬂities in Oman. which are expected to be incurred whenthe operations are ceased. These provis1ehs have been created based on the Group‘s internal est1matee. Assumptionsbased on the current economic environment have been made, which management beheves are a reasonabTe basis uponwhich to estimate the future 11ab1'11'ty. These estimates,1'n010d1ng discount rates, are reviewed regularly to take into accountany mateh‘aT changes to the assumptions. However, actuaT decommissioning costs W111 u1t1‘mate1y depend upon futuremarket prices for the necessary decomm1'ss10n1ng works required that will reﬂect market conditions at the relevant time.Furthermore, the timing of decommissioning 1's 11Ke1y to depend on when the ﬁelds cease to produce at economicahy\habTe rates. This, in turn,v1n'11c1epend upon future 011 and gas pﬁces,wh1'ch are inherehﬁy uncertain.
As part of the Group's reguTar review, the provision was revised due to a change in the discount rate and the expecteddeTay 1n decommissioning works as a resuTt of an extension to the exploration and production sharing agreementin Oman.AccordingTy, the Group reversed the provision by US$641,000 and recorded a decrease in the exploration and evaluationasset by the same amount (Note 4).

The Enterprise Risk Management Framework provides the principaT pohcy and guidance to the Group and its businesseson the risk management methodology and reporting of n‘sKs. It sets out a systematic and ongoing process for identifying,evaTuatihg, controﬂing and reporting risks. These processes are put1n pTace to manage and monitor the Group‘s riskmanagement activities on a reguTar and ﬁmeTy basis. The Group‘s n’sk management efforts covers operational ﬁnancieﬂand strategic areas,
Credit risk
Credit n'sk is the risk of hnanciaﬂ Toss resulting from faﬂure of a customer or counterparty to meet its ﬁnancial] andcontractuaT obh'gations t0 the Group, as and when the obh'gations faT1 due. The Group’s pn‘mary exposure to credit riskarises from 1tsﬁhanc1'a1 assets,

The Group‘smost significant debtors, the Norwegian government, accounts for USS7,458,000 (2016: US$21,180,000)4 As at31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group had no other s1gh1'ﬁcaht concentrations of credit risk for its Teenand receivables ba1ance.
The Group does not require c0118tera1 in respect of its trade and other receivab1es. The Group estabh'shes an aﬂowance forimpairment that represents its est1mate of incurred losses in respect of trade and other rece1vab1es.

In 2016, the Group wrote off doubtful receivables due from its jointly controlled entity of US$I,250,000 as a result ofcertain disputes with its joint venture partner.
Having considered the ageing of the loans and receivables, credit worthiness of its customers and historical default rates,the Group and Company believe that no further impairment allowance is necessary in respect of loans and receivables.These receivables are mainly arising from customers that have a good reputation and payment record.
At the reporting date. the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial assetin the statements of ﬁnancial position.
Cash and cash equivalent
Cash and fixed deposits are placed with reputable financial institutions which are regulated. These surplus fundsare placed on short-term deposits (usually within the range of 1 day to 5 months) according to the Group's cash ﬂowrequirements. The Group does not hedge against longterm ﬂuctuations in interest rates.
At the reporting date, the maximum exposure to credit risk is represented by the carrying amount of each financial assetin the statements of ﬁnancial position,

Quoted debt securities are entered into with financial institutions, which have rating of A66 , Baa3 (2016: A513 , 8366) byMoody’s, or the equivalent by a reputable credit rating agency. Management actively monitors credit ratings and given thatthe Group only has invested in securities with high credit ratings, management does not expect any counterparty to fail tomeet its obligation.
Market price risk
In 2016, the Group held availableaforasale investment in North Energy ASA, which is traded on the Oslo stock exchange.The market value of the investment will fluctuate with market conditions.
In 20‘I7, the Group fully disposed its investment in North Energy ASA, reducing its investment in quoted equity shares toUSSNil. As a result, the Group’s exposure to market price risk is not signiﬁcant.
Sensitivity analysisIn 2016, a 10% increase/(decrease) in the underlying prices of quoted equity securities availableaforisale at the reporting
date would increase/(decrease) equity of the Group and the Company by USSI 53,000. This analysis assumes that all othervariables remain constant.

CONTINGENT LIABILITY - CONTINUEDLegal claims - ContinuedSwitzerland
0h 29 March 2017, the claims by RTM to seek payment of “not less than“ US$1,250,000 plus interest ahd costs fromHIREX (“the Arbitration Award) was agreed by the tntemationeﬂ Chamber of Commerce (“ICC) Arbitra1 Tribunat in Geneva,Switzerland. 0h 20 December 2017, the ICC ordered HtREX to pay RTM the Arbitration Award. The application for registrationof the Arbitration Award has been ﬁled with the Malaysian Court.
Management has considered the above ctaims and allegations and are of the view that these claims and allegations madeagainst RtH, RII and its directors are unfounded.
There are inherent uncertainties contingent upon the courts‘ decisions to grant or dismiss GHL‘s claims. At present,no accurate quantification of any cost, or timing of such costs, which may arise from the 1ega1 proceedings outh'hedabove can be made. Management believes that RIH, RH and its directors are not liable for the allegations made by GHL, andaccording1y does not believe that it is probable for a provision to be set aside for these claims.
Guarantee
During the year, RII has provided a parent company guarantee to the Ministry of Petroleum and Energy on basis of theNorwegian Petr01eum Act.
Under the Norwegian Petroleum Act, RII undertakes financial habih'ty as surety for obligations that may arise fromexp1orat10h for and exp101tation of subsea hatura1 resources on the Norwegian Continental Shelf (“NCS”) and any habﬂity,including Habﬂity for any recovery Claim, which may be imposed under Norwegian law for pollution damage and forpersona1 injury.
Management believes that the Group and the operators of its licences 1h NCS are in compliance With current applicableenvironmental laws and regu1ations and hence does not consider it probab1e that a dam will be made against RH underthe guarantee.
SUBSEOUENT EVENTS
0h 22 January 2018, the Group acquired 2,820,000 shares in LPA and 640 shares in MOL from Lime P10. and Lime Ptc’sh'ght of action against three of its previous directors at a consideration of US$100,000.Th1's resulted in an increase in theGroup’s effective interest in LPA and MOL to 90% and 92.65% respective1y.

REX VIRTUAL DRILLING
Rex Virtual Drilling (”RVD) is a highly advanced, proprietarytechnology that can extract information about the presenceof liquid hydrocarbons from conventional seismic data.
The technology does not require new methods of datacollection but works best an abundant, conventional seismicdata Such data is colTected by shooting acoustic energy —sound pulses 7 into the ground and listening to theresponding sounds. Although seismic data has been thestandard for the exploration industry for many decades, itsuse is typically limited to the identiﬁcation of geologicalstructures in the ground, such as faults and lithologicalchanges. Up until today, the industry‘s focus has been onﬁnding signs of source rocks, reservoir rocks and trappingmechanisms. These geological features may provide indirectsupport of preconditions for Oil presence. yet with someexceptions, do not provide any direct indication of oil. This isalso the reason why the global average oil exploration hit rateof today is estimated at only 10-15 per cent.
With the liquid hydrocarbon indicator RVD. the explorationsuccess rate can be increased. This is because with RVD,
we can see the Oil in the ground: Where it is; how deep it lies:how much there is; and how it fits in the geological context.The efﬁciency of RVD has been extensively tested in blindtests, live tests and actual drilling campaigns.
As documented in ourinitial public offering document dated22 July 2013, RVD achieved 100 per cent accuracy in 18 blindand live tests conducted in Norway, New Zealand, India, Rasal-Knaimah and onshore US. In 201 3, North Energy, a listedindependent exploration 84 production company in Norway,matched the outcome of the drilling of 41 prospects it was

VI RTUALDRILLI NG

monitoring with RVD predictions previously made on thesesame prospects, over a two-year period. Out of the 41 wellsdrilled, 35 predictions by RVD were correct. This translates toan overall 85 per cent success rate, with success rates of 96per cent for dry-well predictions and 69 per cent forcommercial oil ﬁnd predictions.
The Group has achieved two 011 discoveries in Oman and inNorway over the last few years with the support of RVD — theGA Southiil prospect in Block 50 Oman in February 2014 andin the Rolvsnes (previously Known as Edvard Grieg South)prospect in Norway's North Sea licence PLSBSC in
December 201 S,
The technology has also proven to be highly accurate inpredicting dry wells. By incorporating RVD into existingdeirisking processes. oil exploration companies can increasethe Chances of ﬁnding oil whilst saving millions of dollars infutile capital expenditure drilling dry wells.
Research and development efforts on RVD have continuedunabated during the past few years. In 2015, RVD was furtherdeveloped to allow for better depth control (verticalresolution) and more precise reservoir extent (lateralresolution). In 2016, a multi-attribute version was developed,for greaterindependence from geological estimates onporosity and permeability The latest version, RVD version 3(RVDV3), is even more accurate and faster than previousversions, allowing the Group to scale up on the number oflicences to be analysed at any one time.

The NC 3130 beiieves that it is for eachDirector to assess his own capacity and abih'ty to undertake other obh’gations or commitments together withserving on the Board effectively, whilst taking into consideration the maximum number of listed companyboard representations each Director may hoid. The NC does not wish to omit from consideration outstandingindividuals who, despite the demands on their time, have the capacity to participate and contribute asmembers of the Board.
The considerations in assessing the capacity of Directors include the foliowing:
Expected and/or competing time commitments of Directors;Geographicai Tooation of Directors;
Size and composition of the Board; and
Nature and scope of the Group’s operations and size

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
Members of the CompanyRex International Holding Limited
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUEDResponSibiZities of management and directors for the ﬁnancial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with theprovisions of the Act and FRSS. and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufﬁcient to providea reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions areproperly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair ﬁnancial statements and tomaintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a goingconcern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unlessmanagement either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors‘ responsibilities include overseeing the Group‘s ﬁnancial reporting process.Auditors’responsﬂjilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from materialmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors' report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assuranceis a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect amaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually orin the aggregate. they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of theseﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughoutthe audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate toprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than forone resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the overrideof internal controls.
- Obtain an understanding of internal controls relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances. but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’sinternal controls.
. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relateddisclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the auditevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubton the Group‘s ability to continue as a going concern. lf we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are requiredto draw attention in our auditors‘ report to the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosuresare inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of ourauditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
===================================================
92.hocr: 
REPORT ON THE AUDIT OF THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS - CONTINUEDAuditors’ responsibilities for the audit of the finanm‘ai statements 7 Continued
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whetherthe financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activitieswithin the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. We are responsible for the direction,supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audtt opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and signiﬁcantaudit ﬁndings, including any signiﬁcant deﬁciencies in internal controls that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on ourindependence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance in the audit ofthe ﬁnancial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors‘report unless the law or regulations preclude public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances,we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so wouldreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
REPORT ON OTHER LEGAL AND REGULATORY REQUIREMENTSIn our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by those subsidiarycorporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly Kept in accordance with the provisions of
the Act
