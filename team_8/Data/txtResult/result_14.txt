FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT (continued)
(a) Market risk (continued)
(ii) Cash flows and fair value interest rate risks
Cash flows interest rate risk is the nskthat the future cash ﬂows ofa financial instrument will ﬂuctuatebecause ofchanges in market interest rates. Fairvalue interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value ofa financial instrument will fluctuate due to Changes in market interest rates. The Grou p’s exposure tointerest rate risk arises primarily from its borrowings and deposits placed with creditworthy licensedbanks and financial institutions.
The Group’s policy is to enter into variable interest rates borrowings and the market interest rates aretypically priced into the sales transactions.
As at 31 December 2017, the Grou ps’ profit after tax for the financial year would have been lower orhigher by US$76.000 (2016: US$123,000) if market interest rates had been 50 basis points higher orlower with all other variables held constant.
(iii) Commodity price risk
The Group is exposed to ﬂuctuations in the prices of agri—commodities it deals in, including crude palmoil and palm oil products. The Group minimises the risk arising from such fluctuations by entering intocommodities forward contracts and futures contracts, As the Group has not adopted hedge accounting,the fair value changes on these derivative financial instruments are recognised in the profit or losswhen the Changes arise.
The Group’s commodities forward contracts are not traded in an active market and hence their fairvalues are estimated using a valuation technique as described in Note 31(e).
lfthe commodities forward prices had been higher or lower by 5% from the management’s estimatesand other variables remain constant, the Grou p’s profit after tax would have been lower or higher byUS$1S,645,000 (2016: lower or higher by US$5,440,000) respectively, arising from the Changes in thefair value ofthe commodities forward contracts.
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that cou nterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in ﬁnancialloss to the Group. The major classes of finanCial assets of the Group are trade and other receivables, bankdeposits, currency forward contracts, commodities forward contracts and futures contracts on commodityexchanges. For trade and other receivables and commodities forward contracts, the Group adopts the policyofdealing only with customers of appropriate credit standing and history or buying credit insurance whereappropriate to mitigate credit risk. For other financial assets, the Group adopts the policy ofdealing only withhigh credit quality counterparties.
The Group has a credit risk policy in place to manage credit l’lSk. All new customers are subject to creditworthiness check; counterparties are ranked and assigned a credit limit appropriately. Such credit limitwould be approved by the Executive Risk Management Team. In addition, any increase in credit limit requiresapproval from the Executive Risk Management Team The Executive Risk Management Team is mandated tomonitor the payment ageing proﬁle 0fthe third party receivables, to review all the outstanding receivablesregularly and to identify any potential uncollectible for doubtful debts provision and/or writeeoff.

There were no transfers between Levels1 and 2 during the year. The Group’s commodities futures contractsare traded in active markets and their fair values reflect quoted prices at the balance sheet date in activemarkets such as Bursa Malaysia. These instruments are included in Level 1.
The Group’s commodities forward contracts are not traded in an active market, Their fair values areestimated by a valuation technique that takes into consideration various sources of indicative market prices.The sources ofindicative market prices include prices listed on the Malaysian Palm Oil Board (MPOB), pricesobtained from an international news agency, quotes obtained from brokers and actual contracted pricesentered into at the balance sheet date. The fair values of currency forward contracts are determined usingquoted forward exchange rates at the balance sheet date. These instruments are included in Level 2.
The carrying value less impairment provision oftrade and other receivables and payables are assumed toapproximate their fair value. The fair value of financial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated basedon quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar instruments by discounting the future contractual cashflows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar ﬁnancial instruments.

34. NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS
Below are the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations t0 ex1sting standards that have beenpublished, and are relevant for the Group’s accounttng periods beginmng on or after 1 January 2018 or laterpenods and which the Group has not early adopted:
FRS 115 Revenuefrom contracts With customers (effective for annua1 periods beg1nning on or after 1 January2018)
FRS115 replaces FRS 11 Construction contracts, FRS 18 Revenue, and related 1nterpretations.
Revenue 15 recognised when a customer obtains C0ntro1 of a good or service. A customer obtains controlwhen it hasthe abilityto direct the use ofand obtain the benefits from the good or serv1ce. The core principleof FRS 115 15 that an ent1ty recognises revenue to depict the transfer of prom1sed goods or sewices tocustomers in an amount that reﬂects the consideration to which the ent1ty expects to be ent1t|ed in exchangefor those goods or services. An entity recognises revenue in accordance w1th that core princip1e by apply1ngthe f011ow1ng steps:
Step 1: 1dentit’y the contract(s) w1th a customer
Step 2: 1dentifythe performance obligat1ons 1n the contract
Step 3: Determine the transaction phce
Step 41A110catethetransaction price to the performance obhgations in the contractStep 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance 0b11gat1on
FRS 115 also 1nc1udes a cohesive set ofdtsclosure requirements that will resu1t1n an entity providing usersOffinancial statements with comprehensive information about the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty ofrevenue and cash ﬂows arising from the ent1tys contracts w1th customers.
The Group is requ1red to adopt a new account‘mg framework from 1 january 2018 (Note 35). The newaccounting framework has similar requirements of FRS 11S and the 1mpact of adopting the equivalent FRS115 is d1sc1osed in Note 35.
:RS 09 Financial/hstrument(effect1ve for annual penods begmning on or after1january 2018):RS 09 replaces FRS 39 Financla/ instruments: Recognition and Measurement and 1ts re1evant interpretations.
:RS 09 reta1ns the m1><ed measurement model and establishes three primary measurement categones forinancia1assets:amortised cost, fair value through Other Comprehens1ve 1ncome (OCI) and fair value through3roﬁ or Loss. The basis of dassiﬁcaﬂon depends on the entitys bus1ness model and the contractual cashlow Charactenstics ofthe financial asset. Investments 1n equtty mstruments are required to be measu red atair value through profit or loss w1th the 1rrev0cab|e option at 1nception to present changes in fair value inOC|(:\/OC1).Ga1ns and losses realised on the sale ofﬂnancial assets at FVOC1 are not transferred to profit or055 on sa1e but reclassiﬁed from the FVOCI reserve to retatned earnings.
Jnder FRS 109, there were no changes to the dassiﬁcatton and measurement requ1rements for ﬁnancialiabili ies except for the recognit1on of fair changes arising from changes 1n own credit risk. For 11abi|it1esdesigned at fairva1ue through profit or 1055, such Changes are recognised in OC].

:RS 09 relaxes the requ1rements for hedge effectiveness by replacing the bnght line hedge eﬁect1venessests. It requires an economic relat1onship between the hedged item and hedging 1nstrument and for the’hedged ratio’ to be the same as the one management actually use for nsk management purposes.

34. NEW OR REVISED ACCOUNTING STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS (continued)FRS 109 Financ/a/ Instrument (effective for annual periods beginning on or after1january 2018) (continued)
There is also now a new expected credit losses model that replaces the incurred loss impairment modelused in FRS 39. It applies to financial assets classified at amortised cost, debt instruments measured at fairvalue through OCl, contract assets under FRS 115 Revenue from contracts with customers, lease receivables,loan commitments and certain ﬁnancial guarantee contracts.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosure requirements and changes in presentation.
The Group is required to adopt a new accounting framework from 1 January 2018 (Note 35). The newaccounting framework has similar requirements of FRS 109 and the impact of adopting the equivalent FRS109 is disclosed in Note 35.
FRS 116 Leases (effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 january 2019)
FRS 116 will result in almost all leases being recognised on the balance sheet, as the distinction betweenoperating and finance leases is removed. Under the new standard, an asset (the right to use the leaseditem) and a financial liability to pay rentals are recognised. The only exceptions are short-term and Iow»va|ueleases. The accou nting for lessors will not change Significantly.
Some 0fthe commitments may be covered by the exception for short-term and low-value leases and somecommitments may relate to arrangements that will not qualify as leases under FRS 116.
The new standard also introduces expanded disclosu re requirements and changes in presentation.
The Group is required to adopt a new accounting framework from 1 January 2018 (Note 35). The newaccounting framework has similar requirements of FRS 116. The Group has yet to determine to what extentthe commitments as at the reporting date will result in the recognition of an asset and a liability for futurepayments and how this will affect the Group’s proﬁt and classification of cash ﬂows.
INT FRS 122 Foreign Currency Transactions andAdi/ance Consm/erations (effective for annual periods beginningon orafter1january 2018)
INT FRS 122 Foreign Currency Transactions andAdvance Considerations considers how to determine the date ofthe transactions when applying the standard on foreign currency transactions, FRS 21 The Effect of ChangesIn Foreign Exchange Rates. The lnterpretation applies where the Group either pays or receives considerationin advance for foreign currencyedenominated contracts.
For single upfront payment/receipt, the lnterpretation states that the date ofthe transaction, for the purposeof determining the exchange rate to use on initial recognition of the related item, should be the date onwhich an entity initially recognises the non—monetary asset or liability arising from the advance consideration.If there are multiple payments or receipts in advance of recognising the related item, the entity shoulddetermine the date of the transaction for each payment or receipt,
The Interpretation is effective for accounting periods beginning on or after 1 january 2018. Early adoptionis permitted, The Group does not expect a material impact on the financial statement upon adoption oftheInterpretation.

WhHst th‘ts WiH result 1n some timing differences in relation to the revenue to be recognised for eachperformance obligation, management’s assessment revealed that ifthe standard had been adopted inthe current ﬁnancial year, there wou1d not have been a material change to the revenue recognised forthe ﬂnandat year ended 31 December 2017.

Despitelower margins achieved for Bulk segment,our Group’s integrated business model withparticipation in large part of the value chainand ability to sell in global markets underits own brands through well establisheddistribution networks helped to maintainhealthy margins for the Consumer Packbusiness.

Nevertheless, the industrywill experience some consolidation, and thistrend will benefit stronger players like us.Our resilient performance even during toughtimes has confirmed our competitive positonin the industry. We continue to build a strongplatform by investing in manufacturingfacilities within the palm oil value chain andalso by adding new products to our portfolio.
To enhance the our value chain within PalmOil Industry, we invested in a biodiesel plantthree years ago, next to our Westport reﬁnery.This has opened up new growth opportunitiesin the downstream part of the value chainof palm oil industry. We are increasing thecapacity of the plant.
We have also ventured into shipping byacquiring two small tankers recently.Ownership of these tankers will enhance thelogistics requirements of our value chain.

Responsibility& Sustainability
At Mewah, sustainability is part of everything we do.We aim to build a business that lasts for generationsand we strive to continuously build a sustainablebusiness that will bring a positive change to theenvironment which we live in.
There are 5 core areas in our Sustainability approach.

l. Minimising our Environmental Footprint||. Responsible Supply Chain
NI. Product Quality and Safety
IV. Developing our People
V. Community Engagement
CORE AREA 1: MINIMISING OURENVIRONMENTAL FOOTPRINT
A. Reducing our Carbon Footprint- At Mewah Group, we have implemented an encompassing Greenhouse Gas (GHG) Emissions Matrix tomeasure energy consumption, chemicals consumption, wastewater treatment and fuel consumptionin all our manufacturing sites. Ourgoals are to drive better production efficiency and to lower our GHGfootprint.
B. Water Management- At Mewah Group, we constantly monitor our impact on local waterways. We want to ensure that ouroperation does not affect the availability and quality ofwater for local communities and ecosystems inthe areas where we operate.
C. Waste Management- As a responsible manufacturer, we always look to manage the waste from our production in anenvironmental-friendly manner.
- Our action plan to assure sustainable waste management includes:i. Regular assessment of waste-related impacts and risks across all direct operations and supplychain.
ii. Continue to identify the 4R’ components in managing waste:a. Reduce — Focus to improve efﬁciency. To establish practices that are capable to reduce theamount of waste we generate to help the environment.
===================================================

ONESTRONG PORTFOLIOMANY GROWTH POSSIBILITIES
CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY& SUSTAINABILITY
b. Reuse — Practice to reuse materials without change whether for the original or a differentapplication instead of throwing them away, or pass those unused materials on to others whocould use them.
c. Recover — To set up ways to recover the energy values contained within the waste material.d. Recycle — Many of the things we use everyday can be recycled. Recycled items are put
through a process that makes it possible to create new products out of the materials fromthe old ones.
CORE AREA 2: RESPONSIBLE SUPPLY CHAIN
A. Sustainable Palm Oil Policy
Oil palm has the highest oil output for the least amount of land area than any other vegetable oil. It isalso the most widely used vegetable oil in the world. The oil palm industry employs many people andcreates opportunity to bring many communities out of poverty However, this opportunity comes withthe responsibility to address the known risks associated in the palm oil supply chain.
Our sustainable Palm Oil policy is a muiti-stakeholder approach which seeks:
i. To build a traceable and transparent supply chain.
2. To continuejourney ofno deforestation and to commit no burning, protection of high conservationvalue (HCV) areas and high carbon stock (HCS) areas.
3. To reject new oil palm development in forested peatland plantation after May 2015.
4. To ensure protection of the rights of workers, indigenous peoples and local communities.
B. Towards Full Traceability
Mewah Group has developed a Traceable Palm Oil Framework to trace the origin of our palm oil.At the initial stage, we review each of our suppliers through desktop assessment and in-house riskprofiling analysis, with the traceability process developing well; we are progressing fast to the nextstep ofassessing the suppliers’ practices. Based on the outcome from our risk analysis, we will performthe site assessment of the suppliers’ mills based on the general principle & criteria, procedures andquestionnaires that are in line with industrial standards.
For every ton of palm oil and palm kernel oil received into our refineries, we need know the sourceof this oil. Traceability is useful because the information can be utilised to evaluate our suppliers’performance against our Sustainable Palm Oil policy, and to engage with our supply base to bridge thegap between us and our suppliers.
1. Traceability to Mill Approach- Today, transparency and accountability are critical aspects of sustainability. It is extremelycrucial that companies are capable to trace the palm oil they use back to the origin.
- We started tracing back our direct suppliers (palm oil mills) since year 2015. There are 5 keycomponents in our traceability to mill approach:it Parent Company Name of Mill Partyii. Mill Nameiii. Mill Addressiv_ GPS Coordinates of Mill Partyv. Volumes of CPO receive into our refinery

Traceability to Plantation Approach
- The definition of traceable to plantation, or fresh fruit bunch (FFB) traceability, is a subject ofconsiderable debate. This is because there is still no common consensus on the definition oftraceable to plantation in the industry today.
- The Mewah's current approach on traceability to plantations establishes on ensuring theavailability & validity of Malaysia Palm Oil Board (MPOB) and volumes of FFB supply to thesupplied mills.

C. Supplier Engagement Program
We hold training and engagement dialogue sessions with our suppliers as well as periodic audits toevaluate and ensure compliance to our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy. The supplier engagement programalso provides us the opportunity to socialize our Sustainable Palm Oil Policy with our direct suppliers,providingthem with a platform to discuss the implications and requirementofadopting similar policies.
In Year 2017, we hosted 2 major Supplier Engagement Workshop in our refineries, Mewah Oils Sdn.Bhd. and Mewaholeo Industries Sdn. Bhd. 42 palm oil millers and 63 participants have participated inthe event.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT
To the members of Mewah International Inc.
OUR OPINION
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Mewah International inc. (the ”Company’) andits subsidiaries (the ”Group”) and the balance sheet ofthe Company are properly drawn up in accordance with FinancialReporting Standards in Singapore (“FRSs”) so as to present fairly, in all material respects, the consolidated ﬁnancialposition ofthe Group and the ﬁnancial position ofthe Company as at 31 December 2017 and the consolidated ﬁnancialperformance, consolidated changes in equity and consolidated cash ﬂows ofthe Group for the financial year ended onthat date.
What we have audited
The ﬁnancial statements of the Company and the Group comprise:
- the consolidated income statement of the Group for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017;the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 01‘ the Group for the ﬁnancial year then ended;the balance sheet ofthe Group as at 31 December 2017;the balance sheet ofthe Company as at 31 December 2017;the consolidated statement ofchanges in equity ofthe Group for the ﬁnancial year then ended;the consolidated statement of cash flows ofthe Group for the financial yearthen ended; andthe notes to the ﬁnancial statements, including a summary ofsignificant accounting policies.
BASIS FOR OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (“SSAs”). Our responsibilities under thosestandards are further described in the Auditor’s ResponSibilities tor the Audit ofthe Financial Statements section of ourreport.
We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.Independence
We are independent of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority Code ofProfessional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (“ACRA Code) together with the ethicalrequirements that are relevant to our audit of the ﬁnancial statements in Singapore, and we have fulﬁlled our otherethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code.
OUR AUDIT APPROACH
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in theaccompanying ﬁnancial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjective judgements;for example, in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering futureevents that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override ofinternal controls, including among other matters consideration of whether there was evidence of bias that representeda risk of material misstatement due to fraud,
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance in our audit ofthefinancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017. These matters were addressed in the context ofour audit ofthe ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separateopinion on these matters.

Key Audit Matter
How our audit addressed the Key Audit Matter

Valuation of commodities forward contracts oftheGroup
At 31 December 2017, the Group has recognised
the foiiowihg fair values of derivative ﬁnanciai assets/
(iiabilities) as disclosed in Note 16 to the tinahCiai
statements:
- Commodities forward contracts included withincurrent assets: US$23,109,000
. Commodities forward contracts included withincurrent iiabiiities: US$12,875,000
. Commodities forward contracts included withinhon-curreht assets: US$30,000
As these commodities forward contracts are not tradedin an attive market, the reiated fair values are estimatedusing a level 2 valuation technique as described in Note31 (e) to the financial statements.
We focused on the vaiuation ofthe Grou p's commoditiesforward contracts because of the critical accountingestimates involved in determining the indicative marketprices which are used in the valuation ofthese contracts,as disclosed in Note 3(a) to the tinahciai statements.
We held discussions with management to understandthe determination ofthe fairvaiues ofthese commoditiesforward contracts,
With the assistance of our ihtemai valuation speciaiists,we assessed the appropriateness ofthe level 2 valuationtechnique adopted by management by evaiuating theappropriateness of the valuation methodoiogy and thebasis of prices used by management.
Based on the work performed, we found the valuationmethodology to be appropriate and the indicative pricesused by management to be within acceptable range.

Impairment assessment of a manufacturing plantof the Group
As at 31 December 2017, management has identifiedindications ofimpairment reiatingtothe property, plantandequipment (”PPE”) ofa manufacturing plant ofthe Group.
The totai net book value of the PPE reiating to thismanufacturing plant recognised on the baiance sheetamounted to approximateiy US$SO,147,000 as at 31December 2017, as disdosed in Note 3(b) t0 the ﬁnanciaistatements.
Accordingly, an assessment ofthe recoverable amount ofthe related PPE of this manufacturing piaht was carriedout using value—in—use caicuiations, as disciosed in Note3(b) to the financial statements.
We focused on the impairment assessment of thePPE of the manufacturing plant where indications ofimpairment were identified because of the criticaiaccounting estimates invoived in estimating the discountrate, termihai growth rate and operating margin, whichare the key assumptions used in the computation of therecoverabie amou ht ofthe related PPE.
We held discussions with management to understandtheir assessment and decisions.
We reviewed the impairment assessment and the vaiue—in-use calculation prepared by management.
With the assistance of our ihtemai valuation speciaiists,we assessed the appropriateness ofthe key assu mptionsused in the valueeineuse calculation.
We evaluated management’s sensitivity analysis to assessthe impact on the recoverable amount ofthe related PPEby reasonabie possible changes to the key assumptions.
Based on the work performed, we found the keyassumptions used in the value-ih-use calculation to bereasonable.

CHAIRMAN'SMESSAGE
Scale has been the cornerstone ofour growth and development. Wesustain our growth through buildingon the scalable aspects of ourbusinesses which are our large-scalerefineries, strong supplier network,and broad customer base. TheGroup, as such, is well positioned
to meet market demands whiledelivering effective cost solutions forthe benefit of our customers.
2017 proved yet to be another successful yearfor the Group.
Crude Palm Oil (CPO) production in yearsthat followed an El Nino year generallywitnessed an exponential growth. However,2017 has been an exception to that rule, withproduction volumes from both Indonesia andMalaysia beingdisappointinglowdueto loweryields. There was also another concern facedby the industry which was the moratorium onpalm oil plantation expansion in Indonesia.
In spite of that, the Group did relatively wellin the Bulk segment as it experienced strongdemand from the destination markets with aweaker ringgit supporting prices over a goodpart of the year. The good performance is alsothe result of a relatively better than expectedrefining margin with firmer prices as weapproached year end.
The Consumer Pack segment too had a positiveperformance due to improving operatingmargins and better product offerings as itcontinued to expand and sell to more than 100destination markets while offering economiesof scale in its value chain.
The market remains challenging in themedium term due to surplus inventories,tighter government regulations for examplethe push for sustainable palm oil in bothMalaysia and Indonesia, and moratoriumon new plantation in Indonesia. However,these should be mitigated by better supplyand demand dynamics driven by healthierdomestic consumption pattern amonggrowing middle class, continued technologicaladvancement in developing infrastructure andlogistics in supporting palm oil industry, andthe deployment of increasingly automated andenergy efficient technology in oil processingwhich maximises productivity.
Nevertheless, the Group ended the year ona stronger note. The resolute support givenby the shareholders was pivotal to theseachievements. Therefore, the Group proposesa final dividend of 0.004 Singapore centsper ordinary share which along with interimdividend 0.013 Singapore cents, making totaldividend of0.017 Singapore cents per ordinaryshare for the full year.
We are also grateful to our Board of Directorsand employees for their continued supportand passion.A|Ithese putus in a much strongerposition for a sustainable future growth.

Equity method of accou nting
Under the equity method of accounting, the investments is initially recognised at cost and adjustedthereafter to recognise Group’s share of its associated compahys posteacquisition proﬁts or losses oftheinvestee in profit or loss and its share of movements in othercomprehehsive income ofthe investee’s othercomprehensive income. Dividends received or receivable from the associated company is recognised asa reduction of the carrying amount ofthe investment. When the Group's share of losses in an associatedcompany equals to or exceeds its interest in the associated company, the Group does not recognisefurther iosses, unless it has legal or constructive obligations to make, or has made, payments on behalfofthe associated company. Ifthe associated company reports proﬁts, the Group resumes recognising itsshare of those profits oniy after its share ofthe profits equais the share of iosses not recognised.
Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associated company are eliminated to theextent ofthe Group’s interest in the associated company. Uhrealised losses are also eiiminated uniessthe transaction provides evidence of impairment ofthe assets transferred. The accou htihg policies ofassociated company are changed where necessary to ensure consistency with the accou htihg poiiciesadopted by the Group.
Disposais
investment in associated company is derecoghised when the Group loses significant influence. If theretained equity interest in the former assooated company is a financiai asset, the retained equityinterest is measured at fair value. The difference between the carrying amou nt of the retained interestat the date when significant influence is lost, and its fair value and any proceeds on partial disposal, isrecognised in profit or loss.
Please refer to Note 2.5 for the accou htihg policy on investment in associated company in the separateﬁnancial statements of the Company.

Property, piaht and equipment
All property, plant and equipment are initially recognised at cost and subsequentiy carried at cost iessaccumulated depreciation and accumuiated impairment iosses.
On1jahuary 2007, the Group has elected to adopt FRS 101 exemption to deem the previous revaiuationof certain property, plant and equipment as deemed cost. The accumuiated depreciation at the dateof revaiuation was eiiminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset. The net amount is thenrestated to the revalued amount ofthe asset.

Measurement (continued)(ii) Components of costs
The cost ofah item of property, plant and equipment initiaily recognised includes its purchase price andany cost that is directiy attributable to bringing the asset to the location and condition necessary for itto be capable ofoperating in the manner intended by management. Cost also ihciudes borrowing coststhat are directly attributable to the achisitiOh, construction or production ofa quaiifyihg asset (refer toNote 2.7 on borrowing costs).
Depreciation
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-iine method to allocate their depreciabie amounts over theirestimated usefui iives as follows:
Freehoid buildings 2%Leasehoid iahd and buildings i% to 3%(Over the period of leases)Piant and equipment 2% t0 5%Furniture, fixtures and ofﬁce equipment 5% to 20%Motor vehicies 20%Vessels 4%
Freehoid iahd and capital expenditu re in progress are stated at cost and not depreciated.
The residuai values, estimated useful lives and depreciation method of property, piant and equipment arereviewed, and adjusted as appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The effects ofany revision are recognisedin profit or ioss when the Changes arise.
Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment that has already been recognised isadded to the carrying amount ofthe asset only when it iS probable that future economic benefits associatedWith the item Will ﬂow to the Group and the cost ofthe item can be measured reiiabiy. All other repair andmaintenance expenses are recognised in proﬁt or loss when incurred.
DisposalOn disposai ofan item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the disposal proceeds and
its carrying amount is recognised in proﬁt or loss within “Other gains/Iosses”. Any amou nt in asset revaluationreserve reiating to that asset is transferred to retained profits directly
Investments in subsidiaries and associated company
Investments in subsidiaries and associated company are carried at cost less accumuiated impairment losses inthe Company’s baiance sheet. On disposal Ofsuch investments, the difference between disposal proceeds and thecarrying amounts ofthe investments are recognised in profit or loss,

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (continued)Impairment of non-financial assets
Property, plant and equipmentInvestments in subsidiaries and associated company
Property, plant and equipment and investments in subsidiaries and associated company are tested for impairmentwhenever there is any objective evidence or indication that these assets may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (ie. the higher ofthe fair vaiue iess cost to seii andthe yaiueeineuse) is determined on an individuai asset basis unless the asset does not generate cash inflows thatare iargely independent of those from other assets. Ifthis is the case, the recoverable amount is determined forthe cash generating units (”CGU”) to which the asset beiongs.
if the recoverabie amount of the asset (or CGU) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carryingamount of the asset (or CGU) is reduced to its recoverable amount.
The difference between the carrying amount and recoverabie amount is recognised as an impairment loss inprofit or ioss, uniess the asset is carried at deemed cost, in WhiCh Case, such impairment loss is treated as adecrease to the asset revaluation reserve to the extent of the asset revaluation reserve relating to these assets.
An impairment ioss for an asset other than goodwiii is reversed only if, there has been a change in the estimatesused to determine the assets recoverable amount since the iast impairment ioss was recognised, The carryingamount of this asset is increased to its revised recoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceedthe carrying amount that would have been determined (net ofany accumuiated amortisation 0r depreciation) hadno impairment ioss been recognised for the asset in prior years.
A reversai of impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is recognised in profit or loss, uniess the asset iscarried at revaiued amount, in which case, such reversai is treated as a revaluation increase. However, to theextent that an impairment loss on the same revalued asset was preyiously recognised as an expense, a reversal0fthat impairment is also recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are recognised in profit or ioss using the effective interest method except for those costs thatare directiy attributable to the construction or development of properties and assets under construction. Thisinciudes those costs on borrowings acquired specifically for the construction or deveiopment of properties andassets under construction, as well as those in relation to general borrovwngs used to ﬁnance the construction ordevelopment ofproperties and assets underconstructiori.
Borrowing costs on general borrowings are capitalised by appiying a capitalisation rate to the acquisition,construction or production otqualityihg assets that are ﬁnanced by general borrowings.
Financial assets(0) ClassificationThe Group classiﬁes its tihanciai assets in the toiiOWing categories: at fair vaiue through proﬁt or loss and
loans and receivables. The classification depends on the nature ofthe asset and the purpose for which theassets were acquired, Management determines the ciassification of its financial assets at initiai recognition.

Classification (continued)(i) :inancial assets at fairvalue through proﬁt or loss
This category has two subcategories: ﬁnancial assets held for trading, and those designated at fairvalue through proﬁt or loss at inception. A ﬁnancial asset is CIaSSlﬁed as held for trading ifit is achiredarincipally for the purpose of selling in the short term. Financial assets designated as at fair valuehrough proﬁt or loss at inception are those that are managed and their performances are evaluatedon a fair value basis, in accordance with a documented Group investment strategy. Derivatives arealso categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Assets in this category arearesented as current assets if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12months after the balance sheet date.
(ii) _oans and receivables
,oans and receivables are non»derivative financial assets with ﬁxed 01’ determinable payments that arenot quoted in an active market. They are presented as current assets, except for those expected to berealised later than 12 months after the balance sheet date which are presented as nonecurrent assets.,oans and receivables are presented as “trade receivables”(l\l0te14),“0ther teceivables”(Note 15) and“cash and cash equivalents” (Note 17) on the balance sheet,

Recognition and derecognition
Regular way purchases and sales of ﬁnanCial assets are recognised on trade date — the date on which theGroup commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash ﬂows from the ﬁnancial assets have expiredor have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially all risks and rewards ofownership. Ondisposal ofa ﬁnancial asset, the difference between the carrying amount and the sale proceeds is recognisedin profit or loss. Any amou nt previously recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that asset isreclassified to proﬁt or loss.
Initial measurement
Financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transaction costs except for financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss, which are recognised at fair value. Transaction costs for financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss are recognised immediately as expenses.
Subsequent measurement
Financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss are subsequently carried at fairvalue. Loa ns and receivablesfinancial assets are subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Changes in the fair values of ﬁnancial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss including the effects ofcurrency translation, interest and dividends, are recognised in proﬁt or loss when the changes arise.

2.8 Financial assets (continued)
(e) Impairment
The Group assesses at each baiance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset or agroup of financiai assets is impaired and recognises an allowance for impairment when such evidence exists.
(i) Loans and receivables financial assets
Significant financiai difficulties of the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy, anddefault or significant deiay in payments are objective eVidence that these ﬁnancial assets are impaired.
The carrying amou nt ofthese assets is reduced through the use of an impairment aiiowance accountwhich is calculated as the difference between the carrying amou nt and the present vaiue of estimatedfutu re cash flows, discounted atthe original effective interest rate. When the asset becomes u ncollectible,it is written off against the aiiowance accou nt, Subsequent recoveries ofamou nts previousiy written offare recognised against the same iine item in proﬁt or loss.
The impairment allowance is reduced through profit or loss in a subsequent period when the amountof impairment loss decreases and the reiated decrease can be objectiveiy measured. The carryingamount ofthe asset previously impaired is increased to the extent that the new carrying amou nt doesnot exceed the amortised cost had no impairment been recognised in prior periods.
0) Oﬁsettingﬂnancial instrumentsFinancial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amou nt reported in the baiance sheet when there is a
legally enforceable right to offset and there is an intention to settle on a net basis or reaiise the asset andsettle the iiabiiity simuitaneousiy.
2.9 Financialguarantees
The Company has issued corporate guarantees to banks for borrowings of its subsidiaries. These guarantees arefinancial guarantees as they require the Company to reimburse the banks ifthe subsidiaries fail to make principalor interest payments when due in accordance With the terms of their borrowings,
Financial guarantees are initiaiiy recognised at their fair vaiues pius transaction costs in the Company’s balancesheet, if material,
Financial guarantees are subsequently amortised to proﬁt or loss over the period of the subsidiaries borrowings,unless it is probable that the Company wiii reimburse the banks for an amount higher than the unamortisedamount. In this case, the tinanciai guarantees shaii be carried at the expected amount payable to the banks in theCompany’s baiance sheet.
intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
2.10 Borrowings
Borrowings are presented as current liabiiities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlementfor at ieast i2 months afterthe balance sheet date, in which case they are presented as nonecurrent iiabilities.
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value (net of transaction costs) and subsequentiy carried at amortisedcost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption vaiue is recognised inprofit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.

2.11 Trade and other payablesTrade and other payables represent liabilities for goods and services provided to the Group prior to the end ofﬁnancial year which are unpaid. They are classified as current liabilities if payment is due within one year or less (or
in the normal operating cycle ofthe business it longer). If not, they are presented as nonecurreht liabilities.
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at fair value, and subsequently carried at amortised cost usingthe effective interest method.
2.12 Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instru ments comprise mainly ofcrude palm Oil and palm oil products forward contracts, futurescontracts and currency forward contracts.
A derivative financial instrument is initially recognised at its fair value on the date the contract is entered into andis subsequently carried at its fair value. Fair value changes on derivatives that are not designated or do not qualifyfor hedge accounting are recognised in proﬁt or loss Within “cost of sales” when the Changes arise.
Derivative financial instru ments are reported in the fihahCial statements on a net basis where legal right of setoﬂ’exists. Derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when fair value is positive and as liabilities when fairvalue is negative.
2.13 Fair value estimation of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The Group’s commodities futures contracts are traded in active markets and their fairvalues take into considerationquoted prices at the balance sheet date in active markets such as Bursa Malaysia.
The Group’s commodities forward contracts are not traded in an active market and hence their fair values areestimated using a valuation technique as described in Note 31(e)i
The fair values ofcurrency forward contracts are determined using actively quoted forward exchange rates,
The fair values of current ﬁnancial assets and liabilities carried at amortised cost approximate their carryingamounts.
2.14 Leases(a) When the Group is the lessee:(i) Lessee , Finance leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all risks and rewards incidental to ownership of theleased assets are classified as finance leases.
The leased assets and the corresponding lease liabilities (net of finance Charges) under finance leasesare recognised on the balance sheet as property, plant and equipment and borrowings respectively,at the inception of the leases based on the lower 0fthe fairvalue 0f the leased assets and the presentvalue ofthe minimum lease payments.
Each lease payment is apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction ofthe outstandinglease liability. The ﬁnance expense is recognised in profit or loss on a basis that reflects a constantperiodic rate ofinterest on the ﬁnance lease liability.

Estimates, assumptions and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience andother factors, including expectations offuture events that are believed to be reasonable under the circu mstances,
(a)
(b)
Valuation of commodities forward contracts of the Group
The Grou p is exposed to fluctuations in the prices ofagri-Commodities it deals in, including crude palm oil andpalm oil products. The Group minimises the risk arising from such fluctuations by entering into Commoditiesforward contracts and futures contracts. As the Group has not adopted hedge accounting, the fair valuechanges on these derivative financial instru ments are recognised in the profit or loss when the changes arise.
The Group’s commodities forward contracts are not traded in an active market and hence their fair valuesare estimated using a valuation technique as described in Note 3T (e).
If the commodities forward prices had been higher or lower by 5% from the management’s estimatesand other variables remain constant, the Group’s profit after tax would have been lower or higher byUS$l5,645,000 (2016: lower or higher by US$5,440,000) respectively, arising from the Changes in the fairvalue ofthe commodities forward contracts,
Impairment assessment of a manufacturing plant of the Group
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) is tested for impairment whenever there are indications that theseassets may be impaired. Management performs a review to determine whether there are any indiCations ofimpairment in relation to the property, plant and equipment held by the Group.
As at 31 December 2017, management has identified indications of impairment relating to PPE of amanufacturing plant of the Group. The total net book value ofthe PPE relating to this manufacturing plant
that was recognised on the balance sheet amounted to approximately US$50,l47,000 as at 31 December20l7.

(b) Impairment assessment of a manufacturing plant of the Group (continued)
(C)
The recoverabie amount of this PPE was determined based on vaiue-in-use caicuiations. The vaiue-ih-usecalculations are based on a discou nted cash flow model and requires the Group to make an estimate oftheexpected future cash ﬂows from the continUing use of the PPE.
The key assumptions used in the vaiueainause calculation that were subject to critical accounting estimateswere relating to the estimation otthe discount rate, terminal growth rate and operating margin as follows:
Discount rate 9.0%Terminai growth rate 3.0%Operating margin 3.6%t012.5%
Operating margin is calculated as revenue, less cost of sales (excluding depreciation), seiiing and distributionexpenses and foreign exchange gains/(iosses).
An unfavorable change ot1% to any ofthe indiVidual key assumptions listed above would not have resuitedin the recoverabie amounts 0fthe PPE 0fthis manufacturing piant to be lower than its carh/ing amount.
Based on the recoverable amount determined by management, no impairment tor the PPE of thismanufacturing plant was deemed necessary as at 31 December 2017.
Assessment of recoverability of past due trade receivables of the Group
Management reviews its loans and receivables for objective eVidence of impairment on a reguiar basis andby each customer due to the specific risks associated With each debtor. Significant financial difficulties ofthedebtor, the probability that the debtor wiii enter bankruptcy, and default or significant delay in paymentsare considered objective evidence that a receivable is impaired. Management has used its judgement todetermine whether there is observabie data indicating that there has been a signiﬁcant Change in thepayment ability of the debtor, or whether there have been significant changes with adverse effects in thetechnologicai, market, economic or iegai environment in WhiCh the debtor operates in.
Where there is objective evidence ofimpairment, management has used itsjudgement to determine whetheran impairment 1053 should be recorded based on historical loss experience for assets with similar credit riskcharacteristics. The methodology and assumptions used for estimating both the amou nt and timing of futurecash ﬂows are reviewed regularly to reduce any differences between the estimated loss and actual lossexperienced. Further detaiis are disclosed in Note 31 (b)(ii)to the financial statements.
Based on payments made by the debtors of the Group subsequent to the balance sheet date, as well as thepast payment history of these debtors, management beiieves that there is no significant uncertainty in theestimate otthe allowance for impairment of these past due trade receivables that has been recorded in thefinanciai statements as at 31 December 2017.
