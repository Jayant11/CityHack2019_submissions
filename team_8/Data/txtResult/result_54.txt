Key audit matters (Continued)
Write-down of excess inventories (Conti n ued)
The Group purchases raw materials and plans their production based on customers’ order forecast. However, actualsales order from customers may deviate from their initial forecast due to unexpected change in end user demandIn the event that the Group is not able to recover the cost of excess inventories from its customers, these excessinventories may have to be written-down itthese inventories cannot be used in future production or soId to others.In determining whether a write»down of excess inventories is required involved management to exercise high levelofjudgement in estimating the future demand for the products. As such, we identify this as key audit matter.
Our audit procedures amongst others, inciude the foilowing:
- We obtained an understanding of how management plan their production vqume based on customers’forecasts- Where the actual sales orders were materiaIIy lower than the customers’ initial forecast, we obtained
epranations from the management the reasons for the variances and checked ifthe related inventories weresubsequently sold
. We assessed if there were excess inventories that were not recoverabie as at year end and evaluated it theseinventories require writeedown
- Further, we assessed the adequacy of the disclosures reIated to inventories in Notes 2.29 and 10 to theconsoIidated financial statements
Other information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information incIuded in theannual report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statement does not cover the other information and we do not express any form ofassurance conciusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financiaI statements, our responsibiIity is to read the other information and,in doing so, consider whether the other information is materialIy inconsistent with the financial statements of ourknowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materiaIIy misstatedi If, based on the work we haveperformed, we conclude that there is a materiaI misstatement of this other information, we are required to reportthat fact. We have nothing to report in this regard

Responsibilities of management and directors for the financial statements (Continued)
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue asa going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters reiated to going concern and using the going concern basis ofaccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no reaiisticaiternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities inciude overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financiai statements as a whole are free frommaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.Reasonabie assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordancewith SSAs wili always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errorand are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence theeconomic decisions of users taken on the basis ofthese financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAS, we exercise professionai judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error,design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficientand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resuitingfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may invoive coilusion, forgery, intentionaiomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal controi.
. Obtain an understanding of internai controi reievant to the audit in order to design audit procedures thatare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectivenessof the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonabiehess of accounting estimatesand reiated disclosures made by management.
- Conciude on the appropriateness of management’s use ofthe going concern basis ofaccounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists reiated to events or conditions that maycast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group’s abiiity to continue as a going concern lfwe conclude that a materiaiuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in thefinancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are basedon the audit evidence obtained up to the date ofour auditor’s report However, future events or conditionsmay cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures,
and whether the ﬁnancial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner thatachieves fair presentation.

Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by appiyihg the acquisition method. Identifiable assetsacquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values atthe acquisition date. Acquisitionereiated costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which thecosts are incurred and the services are received.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilities assumed forappropriate classiﬁcation and designation in accordance with the contractual terms, economiccircumstances and pertinent conditions as at the acquisition date. This includes the separation ofembedded derivatives in host contracts by the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer wili be recognised at fair value at theacquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair vaiue ofthe contingent consideration which is deemedto be an asset or liability, will be recognised in accordance with FRS 39 either in profit or ioss or as achange to other comprehensive income. if the contingent consideration is classiﬁed as equity, it is hotto be remeasured until it is finaliy settied within equity.
in business combinations achieved in stages, previously held equity interests in the acquiree areremeasured to fair value at the acquisition date and any corresponding gain or loss is recognised instatement of comprehensive income,
The Group elects for each ihdividuai business combination, whether honecontrolling interest in theacquiree (ifany) is recognised Oh the acquisition date at fair value, or at the nonecontrollihg interest’sproportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiabie net assets;

Non-controiling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directiy or ihdirectiy, to ownersof the Company, and are presented separately in the consoiidated statement of comprehensive income andwithin equity in the consoiidated balance sheet, separately from equity attributabie to owners of the Company.
Changes in the Company owners’ ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a ioss of controiare accounted for as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts ofthe controlling andnonecontroiling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Anydifference between the amount by which the non-controliihg interest is adjusted and the fair value of theconsideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.
2.7 Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls ah investee wheh it is exposed,or has rights, to variabie returns from its involvement With the investee and has the ability to affect thosereturns through its power over the investee.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost iessany impairment losses.
2.8 Associates
Ah associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the financial and operatingpolicy decisions of the investee but does not have control ofthose policies.
The Group accounts for its investments in associates using the equity method from the date on which itbecomes an associate.
Oh acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of thenet fair vaiue of the investee’s identifiable assets and liabilities is accounted as goodwill and is included inthe carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group’s share of net fair value of the investee’sidentiﬁable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determinationof the entity’s share ofthe associate’s profit or loss in the period in Which the investment is acquired.
Under the equity method, the investment in associates is carried in the statement of financial position at costplus post—acquisition chahges in the Group’s share of net assets of the associates. The profit or loss reflects theshare of results ofthe operations of the associates. Distributions received from associates reduce the carryingamount of the investment. Where there has been a Change recognised in other comprehehsive income bythe associates, the Group recognises its share of such Changes in other comprehensive income. Unrealisedgains and tosses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extentof the interest in the associates.

Associates (Continued)
When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group doesnot recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise anadditional impairment loss on the Group's investment in associates The Group determines at the end of eachreporting period whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. if thisis the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amountofthe associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the statement of comprehensive income.
The ﬁnancial statements of the associates are prepared as the same reporting date as the Company. Wherenecessary, adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group,
Property, plant and equipment, and depreciation
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost, The cost of an item of property,plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic beneﬁtsassociated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably, Subsequentto recognition, property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and anyaccumulated impairment losses,
Depreciation of a property, plant and equipment begins when it is available for use and is calculated on astraighteline method over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Leasehold land and buildings — 20 to 60 years (lease period)Tools and equipment — 5 years
Renovation — 3 to 5 years
Plant and machinery — 10 years
Furniture, fittings and office equipment — 3 to 5 years
Motorvehicles — 5 years
Computers — 3 to 5 years
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changesin circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each ﬁnancial yeareend, and adjustedprospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is deerecognised upon disposal or when no future economicbenefits are expected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss arising on deerecognition ofthe asset is includedin the proﬁt or loss in the financial year the asset is deerecognised.
Fully depreciated property, plant and equipment are retained in the ﬁnancial statements until they are nolonger in use and no further charge for depreciation is made in respect otthese assets.

Investment properties are properties that are either owned by the Group or ieased under a finance lease thatare heid to earn rentals or for capital appreciation, or both, ratherthan for use in the production or supply ofgoods or services, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment propertiescomprise leasehold land and building ofthe Company, that is leased out to earn rental income.
Investment properties are initialiy measured at cost, including transaction costs and subsequentiy carried atcost iess accumulated depreciation and accumuiated impairment losses. The carrying amount includes thecost of replacing part ofan existing investment property at the time that cost is incurred if the recognitioncriteria are met.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-Iine method over its estimated useful lives of 60 years (ieaseperiod).
Investment properties are de-recognised when either they have been disposed of or When the investmentproperty is permanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal.Any gains or losses on the retirement or disposal ofan investment property are recognised in the statementof comprehensive income in the year of retirement or disposals
Transfers are made to or from investment property Ohiy when there is a change in use. For a transfer frominvestment property to ownerroccupied property, the deemed cost for subsequent accounting is the fairvaiue at the date of change in use; For a transfer from ownereoccupied property to investment property, theproperty is accounted for in accordance with the accounting poiicy for property, plant and equipment setout in Note 2.9 up to the date of change in use;
2.11 Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initiaiiy at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in abusiness combination is their fair value as at the date ofacquisition. Foilowing initial recognition, intangibieassets are measured at cost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment iosses.
The useful lives of ihtahgibie assets are assessed to be finite. Intangible assets with finite lives are amortisedon a straight-line basis over the estimated usefui iives and assessed for impairment whenever there is anindication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and the amortisation methodare reviewed at least at each financial year-end.

(b) PatentPatent relates to the technical know-how of manufacturing base plates.
Following initial recognition, patent is carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and anyaccumulated impairment losses. Patent is amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimatedeconomic useful lives of 20 years and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication thatthese intangible assets may be impaired.
Financial assets
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group and the Company become a party to thecontractual provisions of the financial instrument, The Group determines the classification of its financialassets at initial recognition.
When ﬁnancial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financialassets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
A ﬁnancial asset is deerecognised where the contractual right to receive cash ﬂows from the asset has expired.On deerecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and thesum of (a) the consideration received and (b) any cumulative gain or loss that has been recognised directlyin other comprehensive income is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
All regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised or de-recognised on the trade date i.e.,the date that the Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Regular way purchases or sales are purchasesor sales of financial assets that require delivery of assets within the period generally established by regulationor convention in the marketplace concerned.

0)
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidenceof impairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually signiﬁcant, or collectivelyfor financial assets that are not individually significant. if the Group determines that no objectiveevidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant ornot, it includes the asset in a group offinancial assets with similar credit risk characteristics andcollectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairmentand for which an impairment loss is, or continues to be recognised are not included in acollective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried atamortised cost has been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference betweenthe asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂow discounted atthe ﬁnancial assets original effective interest rate. The carrying amount ofthe asset is reducedthrough the use of an allowance account. The impairment loss is recognised in the statementof comprehensive income.
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets isreduced directly or ifan amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts chargedto the allowance account are written offagainst the carrying value of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on ﬁnancial assets hasbeen incurred, the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significantﬁnancial difficulties of the debtor and default or signiﬁcant delay in payments,
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease canbe related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the assetdoes not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal dateThe amount of reversal is recognised instatement of comprehensive income.

If an availabIe-for-sale financial asset is impaired, an amount comprising the differencebetween its acquisition cost (net of any principai repayment and amortisation) and its currentfair value, less any impairment loss previousiy recognised in the statement of comprehensiveincome, is transferred from other comprehensive income and recognised in the statement ofcomprehensive income.

Financiai iiabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group and the Company become a party tothe contractual provisions of the financial instrument, The Group determines the classiﬁcation of its ﬁnanciailiabiiities at initial recognition.
Ail financiai liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case ofﬁnancial liabilities not at fair valuethrough proﬁt or loss directly attributable transaction costs.
After initial recognition ﬁnancial liabiiities that are not carried at fair value through profit or 1055 aresubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognisedin proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are de-recognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.
A ﬁnanciai liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the iiability is discharged or cancelied orexpires. When an existing financiai liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantiallydifferent terms, or the terms ofah existing iiability are substantiaiiy modified, such an exchange or modificationis treated as a de-recoghition 0fthe originai liability and the recognition ofa new iiability, and the differencein the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Financial guarantee
A financiai guarantee comract is a contract that requires the issuer to make speciﬁed paymehts to reimbursethe holder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment When due in accordance withthe terms of a debt instrument.
Financiai guarantees are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that aredirectly attributable to the issuance ofthe guarantees Subsequent to initial recognition, ﬁnancial guaranteesare recognised as income in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the guarantee. If itis probable that the liability wiil be higherthan the amount initially recognised iess amortisation, the liabiiityis recorded at the higher amount with the difference charged to the statement of comprehensive income,
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legai or constructive) as a result of a pastevent, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle theobligation and the amount ofthe obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reﬂect the current best estimate.If it is no ionger probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,the provision is reversed. Ifthe effect ofthe time value of money is materiai, provisions are discounted usinga current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks speciﬁc to the liability.
