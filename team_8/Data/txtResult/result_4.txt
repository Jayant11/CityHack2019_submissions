INCOME TAX (Cont'd)income tax for overseas subsidiaries is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdiction.
According to a PRC tax circular of State Administration of Taxation, Guoshuihan (2008) No.112,dividend distributed out of the proﬁts generated since January 1, 2008 held by the PRC entity tononeresident investors shall be subject to PRC withholding income tax Deferred tax liability ofRMB321 miltion (2016 : RM8227 million) on the undistributed earnings of the PRC subsidiaries has beencharged to the consolidated statement of proﬁt or loss of the year.
ﬂ
As disclosed in the prior years’ audited consotidated ﬁnancial statements, provision for the LAT Withrespect to properties sold in Shanghai Pudong New District prior to October 1, 2006 were not made as thedirectors of the Company, after taking into account legal advice received and consuitation with the localShanghai Pudong Tax Bureau, were of the opinion that the retevant tax authority is not likely to imposeany LAT on a retrospective basis.
As at December 31, 2014, the tax settlement process for a completed project and a phase of a projectwith properties sold in Shanghai Pudong New District prior to October 1, 2006 had been completed, withadditionat LAT payments made by the Group, For the projects with properties sold in Shanghai PudongNew District subsequent to October 1, 2006, the tax settlement amount determined by the tax authoritiesfor a phase of a project which has commenced the tax settlement process was lower than what the Grouphas previously provided for based on the tax laws Management has assessed and considers that theprovision for LAT made by the Group relating to the above projects for which the tax settlement processhad commenced or completed was adequate to meet the tax settlement amount determined by the taxauthorities.
Management is of the view that it is not probable that the tax authoritywill impose further LAT tax paymentson the above projects located in Shanghai Pudong New District in excess of the provision previously madeby the Group The additional LAT tax exposure in the event of future reeassessmeht by the tax authoritieshas been estimated by management to be apprOXimately RMBSQ7 million (2016 : RMBS97 million) (beforeeffects of deductibility for income tax assessment purpose and adjustment for non—controlling interests)as at December 31., 2017. The amount has been disclosed as part of the Group's contingent iiabilities inaccordance with FRS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets (Note 40).

(ii) Although under the PRC law, Portion B will still be required to bear the Liabilities incurredby Portion A should the assets of Portion A are insufﬁcient to repay its liabilities, the non-controiling sharehoider is required to repay Portion B for the iiability as agreed underthe cooperation agreement. In the event of default of the non-controlling sharehotder,management has assessed that the hon-controliing interest's share in Portion B andguaranteed diVIdend of RMBl.100 biilion (see (iii) beiow) is sufﬁCient to serve as collaterai,

Therefore, this represents a contingent considerationwhich is contingent on the performance of the project company. Based on management'sbudget as at acquisition date and as at year end, the non-controlling shareholder’s shareof NJ DR's budgeted proﬁt is expected to be more than the guaranteed dividend amount.Accordingly, the fair value of the contingent consideration is estimated to be RMB Nil as atacquisition date and as at the end of the reporting period.

INDEPENDENTAUDITOR'S REPORT
TO THE MEMBERS OF YANLORD LAND GROUP LHVHTED
How the scope of our audit responded to the key audit matters

Assessment of recoverable amounts forproperties for development, propertiesunder development for sale andcompleted properties for sale
Properties (consisting of propertiesfor development, properties underdevelopment for sale and completedproperties for sale) (Note 9) represent aSigniﬁcant proportion of the assets in theGroup's statement of ﬁnancial position.
The accounting policies for Propertiesare set out in Note 2 to the comsolidatedﬁnancial statements.
Management's assessment of therecoverable amounts of the Propertiesis a judgemental process which requiresthe estimation of the net realisable value,which takes into account the future sellingprice (net of all estimated selling expenses)and the anticipated costs to completion.The shortfall in the net realisable value overthe cost is accounted for as an impairmentloss in proﬁt or loss.
Management evaluates the recoverableamounts of the Properties by taking intoconsideration of the development plan,timing of sales, current market prices ofthe properties involved or of comparableproperties and the prevailing propertymarket conditions. Management performscost studies for each project, taking intoaccount the Costs incurred to date, thedevelopment status and costs to completeeach development project.
Inappropriate management estimatesmade in the impairment assessmentwould result in a signiﬁcant impact on thecarrying amount of the Properties.
Our audit procedures on the assessment of recoverable amountsof the Properties included, among others:
- We obtained an understanding and tested the design andimplementation of the Group's controls by checking approvalsover reviewing and updating selling price and cost forecasts,setting budgets and authorising and recording of costs.
- We discussed with management to understand their basis usedin determining whether the Group’s Properties are impairedand the amount of impairment to be recorded, if any.
. We challenged management assumptions relating to thereasonableness of the future sales which included transactedprices of past sales of the properties involved or of comparableproperties in Similar locations; actual prices achieved post yearend of the properties involved where available; and the needto adjust for any of these estimated prices considering thecurrent property market trends. We compared these pricesto either externally published benchmarks where appropriate,and also considered whether the expected selling prices areconsistent with the current property market trendsl
- On a sampling basis, we agreed land costs to the acqwsitionof land use right agreements, corroborated projectedconstruction costs to the construction agreements, if availableand compared to the construction costs of the Group’s othersimilar projects based on the project plan‘
~ We focused our work on development projects with slowerthan expected sales or with low or negative margins, Wecompared actual margins achieved to budget, to check theaccuracy of the Group’s budgeting process. Where there weredifferences, we corroborated the management's explahations.We evaluated the sensitivity of the margin to a change in salesprices and costs and considered whether this indicated a riskof impairment.
Based on our procedures, we agreed With management that noindicators of impairment were noted for the Properties held by theGroup as at year end.
We have also assessed and validated the adequacy of the Group'sdisclosures in respect of signiﬁcant estimates made on therecoverable amounts for Properties in the consolidated ﬁnancialstatements.

In determining fair values of compietedproperties, two valuation techniques areused by the Valuer, depending on thenature of each investment property, Thesevaluation techniques used include: (i) directcomparison approach; and (ii) incomecapitalisation approach,
Investment properties under constructionare valued using residual approach,which is estimation of the capital valueof a development with reference to itsdeveiopment potentiai by deducting costsand developer’s proﬁt from its estimatedcompleted development value,
The valuation of the investmentproperties is a signiﬁcant estimation areaas it is underpinned by a number of keyassumptions used in the valuation, whichinclude (i) price per square metre; (ii)capitalisation rates; (iii) market rent persquare metre per month
Inappropriate estimates made in thevaluation assessment wouid result in asigniﬁcant impact on the carrying amountof the investment properties and thefair vaiue changes in the consoiidatedstatement of proﬁt or loss.
Our audit procedures on the valuation of investmeht propertiesinciuded, among others:
- We tested the key controls implemented by the managementto appoint the Valuer and to review and chaiienge the work ofthe Vaiuer,
- We assessed the Valuer’s competence and capabilities andread their terms of engagement with the Group, determiningthat there were no matters that affected their independenceand objectivity or imposed scope limitations upon them.
. We discussed with the Vaiuer to understand the assumptionsand valuation techniques used in valuing the investmentproperties and the market evidence used by the Valuer tosupport their assumptions.
- With the assistance of our internal valuation specialist, weevaiuated the appropriateness of the valuation techniquesused by the Valuer for the respective investment properties,Taking into account the nature of each investment property,we benchmarked and challenged the key assumptions usedin their valuation by reference to externally published industrydata and comparable property transactions, where availabie,and we aiso considered whether these assumptions areconsistent with the current market thIronment.
Based on ourprocedures, wenoted thatthevaluation methodologiesadopted by the Valuer are comparable to the methods used forsimilar property types and consistent with those used in the prioryears, In addition, we noted that the key assumptions used in thevaiuations to be within a reasonable range of our expectations.
We have also assessed and validated that the adequacy of theGroup’s disclosures in respect of the inputs into the vatuationsproperly reﬂected the assumptions used and met the requirementsof the relevant accounting standards.

Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of ﬁnanciat statements that give a true and fair view in accordancewith the provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controlssufﬁcient to provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised useor disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit thepreparation of true and fair ﬁnancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets
In preparing the ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue asa going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis ofaccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realisticaiternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s ﬁnancial reporting process.Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are freefrom materiat misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that inctudes ouropinions Reasonable assurance is a high ievel of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted inaccordance with SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise fromfraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expectedto influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professionai judgement and maintain professionalscepticism throughout the audit. We aiso:
(a) Identify and assess the risks of materiai misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraudor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence thatis sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a materialmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involvecollusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
(b) Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures thatare appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectivenessof the Group's internal control.
(c) Evaiuate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimatesand related disciosures made by management.
(d) Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and,based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditionsthat may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Group’s abitity to continue as a going concern. If we concludethat a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor's report to the relateddisctosures in the ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion Ourconctusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However,future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the Group and statement of ﬁnancial position and statement ofchanges in equity of the Company for the ﬁnancial year ended December 31, 2017 were authorised forissue by the Board of Directors on March 27, 2018.
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING — The ﬁnancial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical costbasis except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance With theprovisions of the Singapore Companies Act and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (”FRSs).
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods andservices.
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlytransaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price isdirectly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of anasset or a liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability which marketparticipants would take into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fairvalue for measurement and / or disclosure purposes in these consolidated ﬁnancial statements isdetermined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within the scope of FRS 17 Leases,and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but are not fair value, such as net realisablevalue in FRS 2 Inventories or value in use in FRS 36 Impairment ofAssetsl
in addition, for ﬁnancial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the
signiﬁcance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities thatthe entity can access at the measurement date;
- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1., that are observable forthe asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
. Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS — On January 1, 2017, the Group adopted all the newand revised FRSs and Interpretations of FRS (“INT FRS) that are effective from that date and are relevantto its operations. The adoption of these new / revised FRSs and INT FRS does not result in changes to theGroup's and the Company's accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported forthe current or prior years.
ADOPTION OFA NEW FINANCIAL REPORTING FRAMEWORK IN 2018 — In December 2017, the AccountingStandards Council (ASC) has issued a new ﬁnancial reporting framework 7 Singapore Financial ReportingStandards (International) (”SFRS(I)”), which is to be adopted by Singapore-incorporated companies listedon the Singapore Exchange (SGX), for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018. SFRSlI) isidenticalto the International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as issued by the InternationalAccountingStandards Board (IASB). The Group and the Company will be adopting the new framework for the ﬁrsttime for ﬁnancial year ending December 31, 2018 and SFRS(|)1 Firstetime Adoption ofSingapore FinancialReporting Standards (International) will be appiied in the ﬁrst set of SFRSU) ﬁnancial statements
SFRS(I) 1 First-time Adoption of Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (International)
As a ﬁrstvtime adopter, the Group and the Company are to apply retrospectively, accounting policiesbased on each SFRSH) effective as at end of the ﬁrst SFRS(I) reporting period (December 31, 2018),except for areas of exceptions and optional exemptions set out in SFRSlI) 1. In the ﬁrst set of SFRSU)ﬁnancial statements for the ﬁnancial year ending December 31, 2018, an additional opening statement ofﬁnancial position as at date of transition (January 1, 2017) will be presented, together with related notes.Reconciliation statements from previously reported FRS amounts and explanatory notes on transitionadjustments are required for equity as at date of transition (January 1, 2017) and as at end of last ﬁnancialperiod under FRS (December 31, 2017), and for total comprehensive income and cash ﬂows reported forthe last ﬁnancial period under FRS (for the year ended December 31, 2017). Additional disclosures mayalso be required for speciﬁc transition adjustments if applicable.
Management has performed a detailed analysis of the transition options and other requirements of SFRSlI)and has determined that there will be no change to the Group’s and the Company’s current accountingpolicies under FRS or material adjustments on the initial transition to the new framework, other than thosethat may arise from implementing certain new SFRSlI) pronouncements effective at the same time (seebelow).
As SFRSll) 1 requires a ﬁrstetime adopter to apply accounting policies based on each SFRSH) effectiveas at end of the ﬁrst SFRSlI) reporting period (December 31, 2018), it is not possible to know all possibleeffects as at date of authorisation of current year‘s ﬁnancial statements.

_ 2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIESlCont'd)78- With some exceptions, ﬁnancial liabilities are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost.
With regard to the measurement of ﬁnancial liabilities designated as at FVTPL, SFRSll) 9 requiresthat the amount of change in fair value of such ﬁnancial liability that is attributable to changes inthe credit risk be presented in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effectsof changes in the liability's credit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge anaccounting mismatch to proﬁt or loss. Changes in fair value attributable to the ﬁnancial liability’scredit risk are not subsequently reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss.
- In relation to the impairment of ﬁnancial assets, SFRSlI) 9 requires an expected credit loss modelto be applied The expected credit loss model requires an entity to account for expected creditlosses and Changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflect Changes incredit risk since initial recognition. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event tohave occurred before credit losses are recognised.
- The new general hedge accounting requirements retain the three types of hedge accountingmechanisms. Under SFRSll) 9, greater ﬂexibility has been introduced to the types of transactionseligible for hedge accounting, spectﬁcally broadening the types of instruments that qualify forhedging instruments and the types of risk components of non—ﬁnancial items that are eligible forhedge accounting in addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with theprinciple of an 'economic relationship’. Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is also nolonger required. Enhanced disclosure requirements about an entity's risk management activitieshave also been introduced.
SFRS(I) 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
SFRSlI) 15 establishes a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arisingfrom contracts with customers.
The core principle of SFRSlI) 15 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer ofpromised goods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entityexpects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or services. Speciﬁcally, the Standard introduces aSestep approach to revenue recognition:
- Step 1: identify the contractls) with a customer.
- Step 2: identify the performance obligations in the contract.
. Step 3: Determine the transaction price
- Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.- Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisﬁes a performance obligation.
Under SFRSlI) 151 an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisﬁed, i.e.when control of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred tothe customerl Far more prescriptive guidance has been added in SFRSlI) 15 to dealwith speciﬁc scenarios.Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by SFRSlI) 15.

- retains the requirement that a transfer into, or out of, investment property can be made when, andonly when, evidence of a change of use of the property exists.
- clarifies that the list of events constituting evidence of a change of use has occurred are onlyexamples.
SFRS(I) INT 22 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
The Interpretation applies to a foreign currency transaction when an entity recognises a honemonetaryasset or non-monetary liability arising from the payment or receipt of advance consideration before theentity recognises the related asset, expense or income.
The Interpretation clariﬁes that:
- the date of the transaction, for the purpose of determining the exchange rate, is the date of initialrecognition of the non—monetary prepayment asset or deferred income liability.
- if there are multiple payments or receipts in advance, a date of transaction is established for eachpayment or receipt.
SFRS(I) 16 Leases
The Standard provides a comprehensive model for the identiﬁcation of lease arrangements and theirtreatment in the ﬁnancial statements of both lessees and lessors. The identiﬁcation of leases, distinguishingbetween leases and service contracts, are determined on the basis of whether there is an identiﬁed assetcontrolled by the customer.
Signiﬁcant changes to lessee accounting are introduced, With the distinction between operating andﬁnance leases removed and assets and liabilities recognised in respect of all leases (subject to limitedexemptions for short-term leases and leases of low value assets). The Standard maintains substantiallythe lessor accounting approach under the eXIsting framework

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
In the Company's ﬁnancial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairmentin net recoverable value that has been recognised in proﬁt or loss.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS — The acquisition of subsidiaries from a common controlling shareholder isaccounted for using the merger accounting methodv Under this method, the Company has been treatedas the holding company of the subsidiaries for the ﬁnancial years presented rather than from the date ofacquisition of the subsidiaries
The acquisition of subsidiaries from a party other than a common controlling shareholder is accountedfor using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate ofthe acquisition date fair values of assets given, liabiiities incurred by the Group to the former owners of theacquiree, and equity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from acontingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquiSItionedate fair value Subsequent Changesin such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement periodadjustments (see below). The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingentconsideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingentconsideration is ciassiﬁed. Contingent consideration that is classiﬁed as equity is not remeasured atsubsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settiement is accounted for within equity. Contingentconsideration that is Classrﬁed as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fairvalue, with changes in fair value recognised in proﬁt or toss.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s prevrously heid interests in the acquiredentity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and theresulting gain or loss, ifany. is recognised in proﬁt or loss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquireeprior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income arereclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree's identiﬁabie assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions forrecognition under the FRS are recognised at their fair value at the achisition date, except that:
- Deferred tax assets or iiabilities and liabiiities or assets related to empioyee beneﬁt arrangementsare recognised and measured in accordance with FRS 12 income Taxes and FRS 19 EmployeeBeneﬁts respectiveiy;
.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionateshare of the entity‘s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured either at fair valueor at the non-controlling interests' proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree’sidentiﬁable net assets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis.Other types of nonecontrolling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basisspeciﬁed in another FRSt
if the initial accounting for a busmess combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting periodin which the combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which theaccounting is incomplete Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (seebelow), or additional assets or liabilities are recognised, to reﬂect new information obtained about factsand circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amountsrecognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains completeinformation about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date and is subject to amaximum of one year from acquisition date.
PUT LIABILITY TO ACQUIRE NON»CONTROLL|NG INTERESTS — When an entity within the Group writesnon-cancellable rights for riori-controllihg shareholders to put back their shares to the entity (the ”Putinstruments) as part of the acquisition of a subsidiary for settlement in cash, a put liability is recognisedfor the present value of the exercise price of the Put Instruments. This creates an obligation or potentialobligation for the entity to purchase its subsidiary's instruments (constitutes the Group‘s own equity in theconsolidated ﬁnancial statements) for cash.
When the non-controlling shareholders still have present access to the returns associated with theunderlying ownership interests, the Group has chosen an accounting policy that the non—controllinginterests continue to be recognised. Therefore, the present value of the Put Instruments is recognised inequity. Subsequent to initial recognition of the ﬁnancial liability, changes in the carrying amount of theﬁnancial liability is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
if the Put instrument expires unexercised, then the charge to equity will be reversed and the ﬁnancialliability will be derecognised. If the Put Instruments are exercised, then the charge to equity will bereversed and the ﬁnancial liability will be derecognised and acquisition accounting will be applied,whereby the acquiSition of the Group's ownership interests in a subsidiary that do not result in the changein control over the subsidiary are accounted for as equity transactions.
FINANCIAL I NSTRUMENT — Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s statementof ﬁnancial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a ﬁnancial instrument andof allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the ratethat exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees on points paid orreceived that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums ordiscounts) through the expected life of the ﬁnancial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period.income and expense are recognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments other than thoseﬁnancial instruments at fair value through proﬁt or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)Financial assets
All ﬁnancial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale ofan investment is under a contract whose terms require delivery of the investment within the timeframeestablished by the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value, plus transaction costs exceptfor those ﬁnancial assets ClaSSlﬁed as at fair value through proﬁt or loss which are initially measured at fairvalue.
Financial assets are classiﬁed into the following speciﬁed categories: ”ﬁnancial assets at fair value throughproﬁt or loss” and “loans and receivables'C The classiﬁcation depends on the nature and purpose ofﬁnancial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.
Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss (FVTPL)
Financial assets are classiﬁed as at FVTPL where the ﬁnancial asset is either held-for-trading or it isdesignated as at FVTPL.
A ﬁnancial asset is classiﬁed as held—for—trading if:- it has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the near future; or
- it is a part of an identiﬁed portfolio of ﬁnancial instruments that the Group manages together andhas a recent actual pattern of short-term proﬁt-taking; or
. it is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument
FinanCIal assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in proﬁt orloss. The net gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned onthe ﬁnancial asset and is included in ”other operating income or ”other operating expense line in theconsolidated statement of proﬁt or loss. Fair value IS determined in the manner described in Note 4 (c) (vi).
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have ﬁxed or determinable payments that are notquoted in an active market are classiﬁed as loans and receivables, Loans and receivables are measured atamortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment. interest is recognised by applying theeffective interest method, except for shorteterm receivables when the effect of discounting is immaterial.
Imgairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through proﬁt or loss, are assessed for indicators ofimpairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are impaired where there is objectiveevidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the ﬁnancialasset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been impacted.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd) _85
Objective ewdence of impairment could include:
~ Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or counterparty; or
- Default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
- it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reforganisation.
For certain categories of ﬁnancial assets, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to beimpaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence ofimpairment fora portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments,an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well asobservable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
For ﬁnancial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between theasset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the originaleffective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all ﬁnancial assetswith the exception of trade and other receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the useof an allowance account When a trade or other receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against theallowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against theallowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in proﬁtor loss.
For ﬁnancial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairmentloss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment losswas recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through proﬁt or loss to the extentthat the carrying amount of the ﬁnancial asset at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceedwhat the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of ﬁnancial assets
The Group derecoghises a ﬁnancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from theasset expire, or it transfers the ﬁnancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership ofthe asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewardsof ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises Its retained interest inthe asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially allthe risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred ﬁnancial asset, the Group continues to recognise theﬁnancial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Classiﬁcation as debt or equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classiﬁed according to the substanceof the contractual arrangements entered into and the deﬁnitions of a ﬁnancial liability and an equityinstrument

Interestebearing bank and other borrowings and senior notes are initially measured at fair value, and aresubsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method. Interest expense calculatedusing the effective interest method is recognised over the term of the borrowings ln accordance wlth theGroup's accounting policy for borrowing costs (see below).
Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initlally at their fair values and, lf not designatedas FVTPL, subsequently at the higher of the amount of obligation under the contract recognised as a

Derecognitlon of ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group derecognises ﬁnancial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged,cancelled or they expire.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedqe accounting

The Group enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign exchange raterisk. Further details of derivatlve ﬁnancial lnstruments are disclosed in Note 21 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and aresubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period.

Derivatives embedded in other ﬁnancial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separatederivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely related to those of the host contracts andthe host contracts are not measured at fair value with Changes in fair value recognised in proﬁt or loss.
An embedded derivative is presented as a non-curreht asset or a nOh-curreht liability if the remainingmaturity of the hybrid instrument to which the embedded derivative relates is more than 12 months andit is not expected to be reaiised or settled within 12 months. Other embedded derivatives are presentedas current assets or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates certain hedging instruments of derivatives as cash flow hedges. Hedges of foreignexchange risk on ﬁrm commitments are accounted for as cash flow hedges.
At the inception of the hedge relationship the entity documents the relationship between the hedginginstrument and hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertakingvarious hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongomg basis, theGroup documents whether the hedging instrument that is used in a hedging relationship is highly effectivein offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged item.
Note 21 contain detaiis of the fair values of the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes.Movements in the hedging reserve in other comprehensive income are also detailed in Note 22.
Cash flow hedge
The effective portion of changes in fair value of derivatives that are designed and qualify as cash ﬂowhedges are recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relatihg to the ineffective portionis recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss as part of other gains and tosses.
Amounts recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed toproﬁt or loss in the periods when the hedged item is recognised in proﬁt or loss in the same line of theconsolidated statement of proﬁt or loss and consolidated statement of comprehensive income as therecognised hedged item, However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognitionof a non-ﬁnancial asset or a non-ﬁnancial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equityare trahsferred from equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or iiabiiityv
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, the hedginginstrument expires or iS sold, terminated, or exercised, or no longer qualiﬁes for hedge accounting. Anygain or toss accumulated in equity at that time remains in equity and when the forecast transaction isultimateiy recognised in proﬁt or loss, such gains and tosses are recognised in proﬁt or loss, or trahsferredfrom equity and included in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or iiability as describedabove. When a forecast transaction is no ionger expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that wasaccumuiated in equity is recognised immediateiy in proﬁt or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS — At the end of each reporting period, the Groupreviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets other than investment properties,derivative ﬁnancial instruments and held-for-trading investment carried at fair value, to determine whetherthere is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists,the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss(if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Groupestimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a preetax discount rate thatreflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the assets
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cashegenerating unit) is estimated to be less than its carryingamount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amounts Animpairment loss is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash-generatingunit) is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carryingamount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment lossbeen recognised for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss isrecognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
ASSOCIATES AND JOINT VENTURES — An associate is an entity over which the Group has signiﬁcantinfluence. Signiﬁcant inﬂuence is the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisionsof the investee but is not control orjoint control over those policies.
A jOint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangementhave rights to the net assets of the joint arrangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharingof control of an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities requireunanimous consent of the parties sharing control.
The results and assets and liabilities of associates orjoint ventures are incorporated in these consolidatedﬁnancial statements using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, an investment inan associate or a joint venture is initially recognised in the consolidated statement of ﬁnancial position atcost and adjusted thereafter to recognise the Group's share of the proﬁt or loss and other comprehensweincome of the associate or joint venture. When the Group's share of losses of an associate or a jointventure exceeds the Group's interest in that associate or joint venture (which includes any longeterminterests that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the assoaate orioint venture), theGroup discontinues recognising its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised only to theextent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of theassociate orjoint venture.
===================================================

NOTES TOFINANCIAL STATEMENTS
December 31, 2017
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
investment in an associate or a joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the dateon which the investee becomes an associate or a joint venture. On acquisition of the investment in anassociate or a joint venture, any excess of the cost of the investment over the Group’s share of the net fairvalue of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of the investee is recognised as goodwill, which is includedwithin the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the Group's share of the net fair value ofthe identiﬁable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment, after reassessment, is recognisedimmediately in proﬁt or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired.
The requirements of FRS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairmentloss with respect to the Group's investment in an associate or a joint venture. When necessary, the entirecarrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with FRS36 Impairment ofAssets as a single asset by comparing its recoverable amount (higher of value in use andfair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount, any impairment loss recognised forms part of thecarrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised in accordance withFRS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases.
The Group discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment ceases to bean associate or a joint venture, or when the investment is classiﬁed as held for sale. When the Groupretains an interest in the former associate or joint venture and the retained interest is a ﬁnancial asset,the Group measures the retained interest at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fairvalue on initial recognition in accordance with FRS 39. The difference between the carrying amount ofthe associate orioint venture at the date the equity method was discontinued, and the fair value of anyretained interest and any proceeds from disposing of a part interest in the associate orjoint venture isincluded in the determination of the gain or loss on disposal of the assomate orjoint venture. In addition,the Group accounts for all amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income in relation tothat associate or joint venture on the same basis as would be required if that associate or joint venturehad directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities. Therefore, if a gain or loss preVIously recognisedin other comprehensive income by that associate orjoint venture would be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss onthe disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Group reclassiﬁes the gain or loss from equity to proﬁtor loss (as a reclassiﬁcation adyustment) when the equity method is discontinued.
The Group continues to use the equity method when investment in an associate becomes investmentin a joint venture or investment in a joint venture becomes investment in an associate. There is noremeasurement to fair value upon such changes in ownership interests.
When the Group reduces its ownership interest in an associate or ajoint venture but the Group continuesto use the equity method, the Group reclassiﬁes to proﬁt or loss the proportion of the gain or loss thathad previously been recognised in other comprehensive income relating to that reduction in ownershipinterest if that gain or loss would be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or loss on the disposal of the related assets orliabilities,
When a group entity transacts with an associate or ajoint venture of the Group, proﬁts and losses resultingfrom the transactions with the associate or joint venture are recognised in the Group's consolidatedﬁnancial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate orjoint venture that are not related tothe Group.

PROVISIONS — Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legai or constructive)as a result of a past event, it is probabie that the Group will be required to settle the obligation, and areliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle thepresent obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertaintiessurrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash ﬂows estimated to settle thepresent obligation, its carrying amount is the present vaiue of those cash flows‘
When some or all of the economic beneﬁts required to settle a provisiOh are expected to be recoveredfrom a third party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement willbe received and the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
MERGER DEFICiT — Merger deﬁcit arises from combination of entities under common control accountedfor using merger accounting method (see Business Combinations). The merger reserve represents thedifference betweeh the aggregate nominal amounts of the share capital of the subsidiaries at the dateon which they were acquired by the Group and the nominal amount of the share capital issued by theCompany as consideration for the acquisition.
STATUTORY RESERVE — Statutory reserve represents the amount transferred from proﬁt after tax of thesubsidiaries incorporated in the People's Republic of China (PRC) (excluding Hong Kong) in accordancewith the PRC requirement. The statutory reserve cannot be reduced except where approval is obtainedfrom the relevant PRC authority to apply the amount towards setting off any accumuiated losses orincreasing capital.
OTHER RESERVE — The negative balance in other reserve comprises (i) the net excess of purchaseconsideration over the carrying amount of nOh—controllihg interests acquired in the subSIdiaries at thedate of acquisition; (ii) the charge of the present value of a put liabiiity in relation to put instrumentsentered into with the honeCOhtrolling shareholders on their equity interests in a subsidiary. Subsequentchanges in the carrying value of the put liability are recognised in proﬁt or toss; and (iii) the share ofreserves and other comprehensive income of a joint venture.
REVENUE RECOGNITION — Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received orreceivable.
Sale of progerties developed
Revenue from properties developed for sale is recognised when the legal titie passes to the buyer orwhen the equitable interest in the property vests in the buyer upon release of the handover notice ofthe respective property to the buyer, whichever is the earlier. Payments received from buyers prior tothis stage are recorded as advances received from customers for sates of properties and are classiﬁed ascurrent iiabiiities.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)INCOME TAX — income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt differs from proﬁt asreported in the consolidated statement of proﬁt or loss because it excludes items of income or expensethat are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or taxdeductible The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have beenenacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end ofthe reporting period.
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in theﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁt. Deferredtax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets arerecognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which deductibletemporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporarydifference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) ofother assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor the accounting proﬁts
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments insubsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control thereversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in theforeseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reducedto the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow all or partof the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settledor the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enactedby the end of the reporting period. Except for investment properties measured using the fair value model,the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would followfrom the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle thecarrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for investment propertiesthat are measured using the fair value model, the carrying amounts of such properties are presumed tobe recovered through sale] unless the presumption is rebuttedt The presumption is rebutted when theinvestment property is depreciable and is held within a business model of the Group whose businessobJective is to consume substantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment propertyover time, rather than through sale. The Group has rebutted the presumption that the carrying amount ofthe investment properties will be recovered entirely through sale.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off currenttax assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes leVIed by the same taxationauthority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (Cont'd)
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in proﬁt or loss, except when theyrelate to items credited or debited outside proﬁt or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directlyin equity), in which case the tax is also recognised outSide proﬁt or loss (either in other comprehensiveincome or directly in equity), or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination.in the case of a business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill ordetermining the excess of the acqurrer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets,liabilities and contingent liabilities over cost
FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSACTlONS AND TRANSLATION — The individual ﬁnancial statements of eachGroup entity are measured and presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in whichthe entity operates (its functional currency). The presentation currency for the consolidated ﬁnancialstatements of the Group and the statement of ﬁnancial position of the Company is RMB.
in preparing the ﬁnancial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than theentity‘s functional currency are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retrahslated atthe rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Non»monetary items carried at fair value that aredenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailihg on the date when the fair valuewas determined. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currencyare hot retranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetawitems are included in proﬁt or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation ofhonamorietary items carried at fair value are included ih proﬁt or loss for the period except for differencesarising on the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised inother comprehensive income For such non-monetary items, ahy exchange component of that gain orloss is also recognised directly in other comprehehswe income.
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction for futureproductive use, are Included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment tointerest costs on those foreign currency borrowings.
Exchange differences on transactions entered into in order to hedge certain foreign currency risks aredescribed in the hedge accounting policies above.
For the purpose of presenting consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the assets and liabilities of the entitiesin the Group which do not have RMB as the functional currency (including comparatives) are expressedin RMB using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. lncome and expense items(including comparatives) are translated at the average exchange rates for the period, unless exchangerates fluctuated signiﬁcantly during that period, in which case the exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions are used Exchange differences arising, if any, are classiﬁed as other comprehensive incomeand transferred to the Group's currency translation reserve.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS IN THE CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS — Cash and cashequivalents in the consolidated statement of cash flows comprise cash on hand, cash at bank and ﬁxeddeposits and are subject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (Cont'd)Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end ofthe reporting period, that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and iiabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, are discussed below.
Carrying amounts of properties for develoomeht comoleted properties for sale and properties underdevelogment for sale

The aggregate carrying amount of these properties totalled RMB49V154 billiOh as at December 31, 2017(2016: RMB45.712 biliion), details of which are disclosed in Note 9. They are stated at cost less allowancefor impairment in value or at the lower of cost and net realisable values, assessed on an individual propertybasis
When it is probable that the totat project costs will exceed the total projected revenue net of sellingexpenses, i,e. net realisable value, the amount in excess of net realisabie vaiue is recognised as an expenseimmediateiy.
The process of evaluating the net realisable vaiue for each property is su bject to mahagement’sjudgementand the effect of assumptions in respect of development plans, timing of sale and the prevailing marketconditions. Management performs cost studies for each project, taking into account the costs incurredto date, the development status and costs to complete each development project. Any future variation inplans, assumptions and estimates can potentially impact the carrying amounts of the respective properties.
Valuation of investment Qrogerties
As disclosed in Note 8, investment properties are stated at fair value based on the valuation performedby an independent professional valuer. In determining the fair values, the valuer has made reference toboth the comparable sates transactions as available ih the relevant market of these properties and thecapitalisation of the existing and reversionary rental income potential.
The estimated value from capitaiisatiOh of the existing and reversionary rental income potential is usedas an estimate of fair vaiue, and the estimate is dependent on several variable parameters and proiectionsincluding projected rental income, occupancy rate, rental yield, discount rate and terminal yield.
Any change in the variable parameters and projections will result in change in fair value estimate for theinvestmeht properties which can potentialiy be signiﬁcant
in relying on the independent professional vaiuation report, management considered the method ofvaluation and the Group's marketing strategy and is of the view that the estimated values are reasonabie.
