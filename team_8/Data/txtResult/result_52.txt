INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
The Board of Directors and ShareholdersChi Mei Materials Technology Corporation
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying consolidated financial statements of Chi Mei Materials TechnologyCorporation (CMMT) and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as the Corporation), which comprise theconsolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to theconsolidated financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, theconsolidated financial position of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and its consolidatedfinancial performance and its consolidated cash flows for the years then ended in accordance with theRegulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers, and International FinancialReporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRIC Interpretations (IFRIC), and SICInterpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the Financial Supervisory Commission of the Republicof China.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of FinancialStatements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China.Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit ofthe Consolidated Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Corporation inaccordance with the Norm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, andwe have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that theaudit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit ofthe consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. These matters were addressed inthe context of our audit of the consolidated financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon,and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters for the Corporation’s consolidated financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2017are stated as follows:
Timing of Revenue Recognition
CMMT’s major source of revenue comes from the sale of polarizing film. This kind of revenue is mainlyrecognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to the customersupon delivery to carriers approved by the customers or to the designated destination. However, there remains arisk of revenue not being recorded in an appropriate period before the significant risks and rewards of ownershipof the goods have been transferred to the customers where physical deliveries have not been fulfilled. As a result,we considered timing for revenue recognition as a key audit matter. Refer to Note 4 to the consolidated financialstatements for detailed information on revenue recognition.
Our main audit procedures performed in respect of the above area include the following:1. Considered CMMT’s accounting policy for revenue recognition;
100
===================================================
105.hocr: 
2. Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over revenue recognition;
3. Selected all samples of shipments before and after the year-end for a specific period of time and vouched forsupporting evidence and records to ensure the accuracy of the timing of revenue recognition;
4. Evaluated whether the risks and rewards of ownership for the goods had been transferred.
Impairment Assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) and Intangible Assets

When an indication of an asset’s impairment exists, management should perform an impairment assessment,which incorporates judgments based on assumptions about the future profitability for the related businessesagainst which appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates must be applied. Management’s estimationabout the recoverable amounts of PP&E and intangible assets is complicated and has significant uncertainty,especially in the assumptions surrounding the estimated discount rate and future expected cash flows, whichdepended on changing economic or market trends. Therefore, the impairment assesment of PP&E and intangibleassets is identified as a key audit matter. Refer to Notes 4, 5, 12 and 14 to the consolidated financial statementsfor the details about PP&E and intangible assets.
We inquired of management and understood the process and basis by which management assessed assets forimpairment assessment; and tested the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control. We also challengedthe assumptions underpinning the impairment assessment models, including the discount rates used, long-termgrowth rates and cash flow forecasts. This was achieved through the assistance of Deloitte valuation specialistscritically assessing the discount rate and long-term growth rates applied by management and assessing thereasonableness of forecasted future cash flows by comparison to historical performance and future outlook.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Consolidated FinancialStatements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financial statements inaccordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers andInternational Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), International Accounting Standards (IAS), IFRICInterpretations (IFRIC), and SIC Interpretations (SIC) endorsed and issued into effect by the FinancialSupervisory Commission of the Republic of China, and for such internal control as management determines isnecessary to enable the preparation of consolidated financial statements that are free from material misstatement,whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Corporation’sability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using thegoing concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to ceaseoperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance, including the audit committee, are responsible for overseeing the Corporation’sfinancial reporting process.
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolidated financial statements as awhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report thatincludes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an auditconducted in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will alwaysdetect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are consideredmaterial if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated financial statements.
101
===================================================
106.hocr: 
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, weexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
1.
Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the consolidated financial statements, whether dueto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidencethat is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a materialmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theCorporation’s internal control.
Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates andrelated disclosures made by management.
Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that maycast significant doubt on the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that amaterial uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosuresin the consolidated financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Ourconclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, futureevents or conditions may cause the Corporation to cease to continue as a going concern.
Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the consolidated financial statements, includingthe disclosures, and whether the consolidated financial statements represent the underlying transactions andevents in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or businessactivities within the Corporation to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We areresponsible for the direction, supervision, and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible forour audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope andtiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control thatwe identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethicalrequirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters thatmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
102
===================================================
107.hocr: 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were ofmost significance in the audit of the consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law orregulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determinethat a matter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so wouldreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle
Several standards, including IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”, IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” andIFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, were amended in this annual improvement.
IFRS 3 was amended to clarify that contingent consideration should be measured at fair valueirrespective of whether the contingent consideration is a financial instrument within the scope ofIFRS 9 or IAS 39. Changes in fair value should be recognized in profit or loss. The amendment willbe applied prospectively to business combinations with acquisition dates on or after January 1, 2017.Refer to Note 26 for information on business combinations that occurred in 2017.
The amended IFRS 8 requires the Corporation to disclose the judgments made by management inapplying the aggregation criteria to operating segments, including a description of the operatingsegments aggregated and the economic indicators assessed in determining whether the operatingsegments have “similar economic characteristics”. The amendment also clarifies that areconciliation of the total of the reportable segments’ assets to the entity’s assets should only beprovided if the segments’ assets are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
When the amended IFRS 13 becomes effective in 2017, the short-term receivables and payableswith no stated interest rate will be measured at their invoice amounts without discounting, if theeffect of not discounting is immaterial.
IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” was amended to clarify that a management entity providing keymanagement personnel services to the Corporation is a related party of the Corporation.Consequently, the Corporation is required to disclose as related party transactions the amountsincurred for the services paid or payable to the management entity for the provision of keymanagement personnel services. However, disclosure of the components of such compensation isnot required.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 CycleSeveral standards, including IFRS 3 and IFRS 13, were amended in this annual improvement.
The scope in IFRS 13 of the portfolio exception for measuring the fair value of a group of financialassets and financial liabilities on a net basis was amended to clarify that it includes all contracts thatare within the scope of, and accounted for in accordance with, IAS 39 or IFRS 9, even thosecontracts which do not meet the definitions of financial assets or financial liabilities within IAS 32.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 “Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation andAmortization”
The amendments stipulate that an entity should use appropriate depreciation and amortizationmethods to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits of property, plant andequipment and intangible assets are expected to be consumed by the entity.
The amended IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” stipulates that a depreciation method that is
based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.The amended standard does not provide any exception from this requirement.
- 111 -
===================================================
116.hocr: 
The amended IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” clarifies there is a rebuttable presumption that anamortization method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use ofan intangible asset is not appropriate. This presumption can be overcome only in the followinglimited circumstances:
a) In which an intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue (for example, a contract thatspecifies that the entity’s use of the intangible asset will expire upon achievement of a revenuethreshold); or
b) When it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of anintangible asset are highly correlated.
5) Amendments to the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by SecuritiesIssuers
The amendments include additions of several accounting items and requirements for disclosures ofthe impairment of non-financial assets as a consequence of the IFRSs endorsed and issued intoeffect by the FSC. In addition, as a result of the post implementation review of IFRSs in Taiwan, theamendments also include an emphasis on certain recognition and measurement considerations andadd requirements for disclosures of related party transactions and goodwill.
The amendments stipulate that other companies or institutions of which the chairman of the boardof directors or president serves as the chairman of the board of directors or the president of theCorporation, or is the spouse or second immediate family of the chairman of the board of directorsor president of the Corporation are deemed to have a substantive related party relationship, unless itcan be demonstrated that no control, joint control, or significant influence exists. Furthermore, theamendments require the disclosure of the names of the related parties and the relationships withwhom the Corporation has significant transactions. If the transactions or balance with a specificrelated party is 10% or more of the Corporation’s respective total transactions or balance, suchtransactions should be separately disclosed by the name of each related party.
When the amendments are applied retrospectively starting from January 1, 2017, the disclosures ofrelated party transactions are enhanced. Refer to Note 31 for related disclosures.

The initial application of the above New IFRSs, whenever applied, would not have any material impacton the Corporation’s accounting policies, except for the following:
1) IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and related amendment

Classification, measurement and impairment of financial assets
With regard to financial assets, all recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IAS 39“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” are subsequently measured at amortizedcost or fair value. Under IFRS 9, the requirement for the classification of financial assets is statedbelow.
For the Corporation’s debt instruments that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments ofprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, their classification and measurement areas follows:
a) For debt instruments, if they are held within a business model whose objective is to collectcontractual cash flows, the financial assets are measured at amortized cost and are assessed forimpairment continuously with any impairment loss recognized in profit or loss. Interest revenueis recognized in profit or loss by using the effective interest method;
b) For debt instruments, if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved byboth collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, the financial assets aremeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and are assessed forimpairment. Interest revenue is recognized in profit or loss by using the effective interestmethod, and other gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, except forimpairment gains or losses and foreign exchange gains and losses. When the debt instrumentsare derecognized or reclassified, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in othercomprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
Except for the above, all other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.However, the Corporation may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in thefair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, withonly dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss. No subsequent impairment assessmentis required, and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive incomecannot be reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
The Corporation elects not to restate prior reporting periods when applying the requirements for theclassification, measurement and impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9 with the cumulative

cost - current - 273.539 273.539
Total effect on assets $ 273,539 $ - $ 273,539

IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and the related amendment
IFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with customers,and will supersede IAS 18 “Revenue”, IAS 11 “Construction Contracts” and a number ofrevenue-related interpretations.
When applying IFRS 15, the Corporation recognizes revenue by applying the following steps:
Identify the contract with the customer;
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
Determine the transaction price;
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; andRecognize revenue when the Corporation satisfies a performance obligation.
In addition, the Corporation will disclose the difference between the amount that results fromapplying IFRS 15 and the amount that results from applying current standards for 2018.
The anticipated effect of retrospectively applying IFRS 15 is detailed below:

===================================================
119.hocr: 
3) Amendments to IAS 12 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses”
The amendments clarify that the difference between the carrying amount of a debt instrumentmeasured at fair value and its tax base gives rise to a temporary difference, even though there areunrealized losses on that asset, irrespective of whether the Corporation expects to recover thecarrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by holding it and collecting contractual cashflows.
In addition, in determining whether to recognize a deferred tax asset, the Corporation should assessa deductible temporary difference in combination with all of its other deductible temporarydifferences, unless the tax law restricts the utilization of losses as deduction against income of aspecific type; and, in which case, a deductible temporary difference is assessed in combination onlywith other deductible temporary differences of the appropriate type. The amendments also stipulatethat, when determining whether to recognize a deferred tax asset, the estimate of probable futuretaxable profit may include some of the Corporation’s assets for more than their carrying amount ifthere is sufficient evidence that it is probable that the Corporation will achieve the higher amount,and that the estimate for future taxable profit should exclude tax deductions resulting from the
reversal of deductible temporary differences.
Except for the above impact, as of the date the consolidated financial statements were authorized forissue, the Corporation is continuously assessing the possible impact that the application of otherstandards and interpretations will have on the Corporation’s financial position and financialperformance and will disclose the relevant impact when the assessment is completed.

IFRS 16 “Leases”
IFRS 16 sets out the accounting standards for leases that will supersede IAS 17 and a number ofrelated interpretations.
Under IFRS 16, if the Corporation is a lessee, it shall recognize right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities for all leases on the consolidated balance sheets except for low-value and short-termleases. The Corporation may elect to apply the accounting method similar to the accounting foroperating leases under IAS 17 to low-value and short-term leases. On the consolidated statements ofcomprehensive income, the Corporation should present the depreciation expense charged onright-of-use assets separately from the interest expense accrued on lease liabilities; interest iscomputed by using the effective interest method. On the consolidated statements of cash flows, cashpayments for the principal portion of lease liabilities are classified within financing activities; cashpayments for the interest portion are classified within operating activities.
The application of IFRS 16 is not expected to have a material impact on the accounting of theCorporation as lessor.
When IFRS 16 becomes effective, the Corporation may elect to apply this standard eitherretrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effectof the initial application of this standard recognized at the date of initial application.
IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments”
IFRIC 23 clarifies that when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Corporation shouldassume that the taxation authority will have full knowledge of all related information when makingrelated examinations. If the Corporation concludes that it is probable that the taxation authority willaccept an uncertain tax treatment, the Corporation should determine the taxable profit, tax bases,unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatments used orplanned to be used in its income tax filings. If it is not probable that the taxation authority willaccept an uncertain tax treatment, the Corporation should make estimates using either the mostlikely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment, depending on which method the entityexpects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The Corporation has to reassess itsjudgments and estimates if facts and circumstances change.
On initial application, the Corporation shall apply IFRIC 23 either retrospectively to each priorreporting period presented, if this is possible without the use of hindsight, or retrospectively withthe cumulative effect of the initial application of IFRIC 23 recognized at the date of initialapplication.
Except for the above impact, as of the date the consolidated financial statements were authorized forissue, the Corporation is continuously assessing the possible impact that the application of otherstandards and interpretations will have on the Corporation’s financial position and financialperformance, and will disclose the relevant impact when the assessment is completed.
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a.
Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the RegulationsGoverning the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and IFRSs as endorsed and issuedinto effect by the FSC.
- 116 -
===================================================
121.hocr: 
b. Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except forfinancial instruments which are measured at fair value.
The fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair valuemeasurement inputs are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement inits entirety, which are described as follows:
1) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
2) Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable forthe asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
3) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.c. Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilitiesCurrent assets include:1) Assets held primarily for the purpose of trading;2) Assets expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period; and
3) Cash and cash equivalents unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle aliability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
Current liabilities include:1) Liabilities held primarily for the purpose of trading;2) Liabilities due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; and
3) Liabilities for which the Corporation does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for atleast 12 months after the reporting period.
Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are classified as non-current.d. Basis of consolidation
Principles for preparing consolidated financial statements

The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of CMMT and itssubsidiaries.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in theconsolidated statement of comprehensive income from the effective date of acquisition up to theeffective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring theiraccounting policies into line with those used by CMMT.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated in full upon consolidation.
Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of CMMT and to thenon-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
- 117 -
===================================================
122.hocr: 
Changes in the Corporation’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Corporationlosing control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts ofthe interests of the Corporation and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes intheir relative interests in the subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which thenon-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received isrecognized directly in equity and attributed to the owners of CMMT.
When the Corporation loses control of a subsidiary, a gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss and iscalculated as the difference between (i) the aggregate of the fair value of the consideration received andany investment retained in the former subsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost and (ii)the assets (including any goodwill) and liabilities and any non-controlling interests of the formersubsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date when control is lost. The Corporation accounts for allamounts recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to that subsidiary on the same basis aswould be required if the Corporation had directly disposed of the related assets or liabilities.
See mm 11 and Table 7 for the detailed information of subsidiaries (including the percentages ofownership and main businesses).
Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-related costs aregenerally recognized in profit or loss as they are incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of anynon-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the Corporation’s previously held equityinterests in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquiredand the liabilities assumed.
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionateshare of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured at thenon-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiablenet assets.
Foreign currencies
In preparing these financial statements of each individual group entity, transactions in currencies otherthan the Corporation’s functional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates ofexchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslatedat the rates prevailing at that date. Exchange differences on monetary items arising from settlement ortranslation are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise except for exchangedifferences on foreign currency borrowings related to assets under construction for future productiveuse, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded as an adjustment to interestcosts on those foreign currency borrowings.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslatedat the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arisingfrom the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the period except forexchange differences arising from the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains andlosses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differencesare also recognized directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using theexchange rate at the date of the transaction.
- 118 -
===================================================
123.hocr: 
For the purpose of presenting consolidated financial statements, the functional currencies of the groupentities (including subsidiaries in other countries that use currency different from the currency ofCMMT) are translated into the presentation currency, the New Taiwan dollar, as follows: Assets andliabilities are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period; income andexpense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. The resulting currencytranslation differences are recognized in other comprehensive income (attributed to the owners ofCMMT and non-controlling interests as appropriate).
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Corporation’s entire interest in a foreignoperation, or a disposal involving the loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation,or a partial disposal of an interest in a joint arrangement or an associate that includes a foreign operationof which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated inequity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of CMMT are reclassified to profit or loss.
Inventories
Inventories consist of commodities, raw materials, finished goods and work in progress and are stated atthe lower of cost or net realizable value. Inventory write-downs are made by item, except where it maybe appropriate to group similar or related items. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price ofinventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories arerecorded at the weighted-average cost on the balance sheet date.
Property, plant, and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulatedimpairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognizedimpairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. Suchassets are depreciated and classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipmentwhen completed and ready for their intended use.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized using the straight-line method. Eachsignificant part is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciationmethod are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of any changes in theestimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
On derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sales proceedsand the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition of a business is carried at cost as established at the date ofacquisition of the business less accumulated impairment loss.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Corporation’scash-generating units or groups of cash-generating units (referred to as cash-generating units) that isexpected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or morefrequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired, by comparing its carrying amount,including the attributed goodwill, with its recoverable amount. However, if the goodwill allocated to acash-generating unit was acquired in a business combination during the current annual period, that unitshall be tested for impairment before the end of the current annual period. If the recoverable amount ofthe cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reducethe carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata
- 119 -
===================================================
124.hocr: 
based on the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognized directly inprofit or loss. An impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversed in subsequent periods.
If goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit and the Corporation disposes of an operationwithin that unit, the goodwill associated with the operation disposed of is included in the carryingamount of the operation when determining the gain or loss on disposal and is measured on the basis ofthe relative values of the operation disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Intangible assets1) Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are initially measured at costand subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss.Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual values, andamortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of anychanges in the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefiniteuseful lives that are acquired separately are measured at cost less accumulated impairment loss.
2) Derecognition of intangible assets
On derecognition of an intangible asset, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and thecarrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets other than goodwill
At the end of each reporting period, the Corporation reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible andintangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assetshave suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset isestimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate therecoverable amount of an individual asset, the Corporation estimates the recoverable amount of thecash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverableamount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carryingamount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount, with the resultingimpairment loss recognized in profit or loss.
When an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generatingunit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent of the carryingamount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset orcash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when a group entity becomes a party to thecontractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that aredirectly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other thanfinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deductedfrom the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fairvalue through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.
1) Financial assets

===================================================
125.hocr: 
All regular way purchases or sales of financial assets are recognized and derecognized on asettlement date basis.
a)
b)
Measurement categories
Financial assets are classified into the following categories: Financial assets at fair valuethrough profit or loss, available-for-sale financial assets, and loans and receivables.
i. Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets are classified as at fair value through profit or loss when the financial assetis either held for trading or is designated as at fair value through profit or loss.
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are stated at their fair value, with anygains or losses arising on remeasurement recognized in profit or loss. The net gain or lossrecognized in profit or loss incorporates any dividend or interest earned on the financialasset. Fair value is determined in the manner described in Note 30.
ii. Available-for-sale financial assets
Available-for-sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either designated asavailable-for-sale or are not classified as loans and receivables, held-to-maturity investmentsor financial assets at fair value through profit or loss.
Available-for-sale financial assets are measured at fair value. Changes in the carryingamount of available-for-sale monetary financial assets relating to changes in foreigncurrency exchange rates, interest income calculated using the effective interest method anddividends on available-for-sale equity investments are recognized in profit or loss. Otherchanges in the carrying amount of available-for-sale financial assets are recognized in othercomprehensive income and will be reclassified to profit or loss when the investment isdisposed of or is determined to be impaired.
Dividends on available-for-sale equity instruments are recognized in profit or loss when theCorporation’s right to receive the dividends is established.
iii. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables (including accounts receivable and cash and cash equivalents) aremeasured using the effective interest method at amortized cost less any impairment, exceptfor short-term receivables when the effect of discounting is immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicatorsof impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impairedwhen there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after theinitial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment havebeen affected.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, such as accounts receivable and otherreceivables, such assets are assessed for impairment on a collective basis even if they wereassessed not to be impaired individually. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio ofreceivables could include the Corporation’s past experience of collecting payments, an increasein the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 days, as
- 121 -
===================================================
126.hocr: 
well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaultson receivables.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognized isthe difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated futurecash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of theimpairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring afterthe impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed throughprofit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairmentis reversed does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment notbeen recognized.
For available-for-sale equity investments, a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value ofthe security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
When an available-for-sale financial asset is considered to be impaired, cumulative gains orlosses previously recognized in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss inthe period.
In respect of available-for-sale equity securities, impairment losses previously recognized inprofit or loss are not reversed through profit or loss. Any increase in fair value subsequent to animpairment loss is recognized in other comprehensive income. In respect of available-for-saledebt securities, the impairment loss is subsequently reversed through profit or loss if an increasein the fair value of the investment can be objectively related to an event occurring after therecognition of the impairment loss.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for allfinancial assets with the exception of accounts receivable and other receivables where thecarrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When accounts receivableand other receivables are considered uncollectible, they are written off against the allowanceaccount. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against theallowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognized inprofit or loss except for uncollectible accounts receivable and other receivables that are writtenoff against the allowance account.
¢) Derecognition of financial assets
The Corporation derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cashflows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risksand rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carryingamount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain orloss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.
2) Financial liabilities
a) Subsequent measurement
Except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, all the financial liabilities aremeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
-122-
===================================================
127.hocr: 
3)
b) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability derecognized and theconsideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, isrecognized in profit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments
The Corporation enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure tointerest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered intoand are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Theresulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designatedand effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or lossdepends on the nature of the hedge relationship. When the fair value of derivative financialinstruments is positive, the derivative is recognized as a financial asset; when the fair value ofderivative financial instruments is negative, the derivative is recognized as a financial liability.
m. Provisions
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the discounted cash flows of the consideration requiredto settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks anduncertainties surrounding the obligation.
n. Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reducedfor estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Allowance for sales returns andliability for returns are recognized at the time of sale based on the seller’s reliable estimate of futurereturns and based on past experience and other relevant factors.
D
2)
Sale of goodsRevenue from the sale of goods is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied:
a) The Corporation has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership ofthe goods;
b) The Corporation retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usuallyassociated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
¢) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
d) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to theCorporation; and
e) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
The Corporation does not recognize sales revenue on materials delivered to subcontractors becausethis delivery does not involve a transfer of risks and rewards of the materials’ ownership.
Rendering of services
Service income is recognized when services are provided. Revenue from a contract to provideservices is recognized by reference to the stage of completion of the contract.
-123 -
===================================================
128.hocr: 
3) Interest incomeInterest income from a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefitswill flow to the Corporation and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income isaccrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effectiveinterest rate.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risksand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevantlease.
Borrowing costsBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assetsare added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending theirexpenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
Other than stated above, all other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in whichthey are incurred.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Corporation willcomply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or forthe purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Corporation with no future related costs arerecognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.
Employee benefits
1) Short-term employee benefits
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscountedamount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
2) Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense whenemployees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
S124-
===================================================
129.hocr: 
1) Current tax
According to the Income Tax Law, an additional tax at 10% of unappropriated earnings is providedfor as income tax in the year the shareholders approve to retain the earnings.
Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s taxprovision.
2) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred taxassets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused loss carryforwardsand unused tax credits for purchases of machinery, equipment and technology, research anddevelopment expenditures, and personnel training expenditures to the extent that it is probable thattaxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can beutilized.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investmentsin subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Corporation isable to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporarydifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductibletemporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to theextent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize thebenefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period andreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available toallow all or part of the asset to be recovered. A previously unrecognized deferred tax asset is alsoreviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it has becomeprobable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in theperiod in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) thathave been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement ofdeferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the mannerin which the Corporation expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carryingamount of its assets and liabilities.
3) Current and deferred tax for the year
Current and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that arerecognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current anddeferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.
5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATIONUNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Corporation’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgments,estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparentfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and otherfactors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.

The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accountingestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that periodor in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a. Income taxes
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets in relation to unused taxlosses and future deductible temporary differences was NT$462,442 thousand and NT$455,049thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, no deferred tax asset has been recognizedon tax losses and future deductible temporary differences of NT$401,788 thousand and NT$444,596thousand, respectively, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. The realizability of deferredtax assets mainly depends on whether sufficient future profits or taxable temporary differences will beavailable. In cases where the actual future profits generated are less than expected, a material reversal ofdeferred tax assets may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which such areversal takes place.
b. Estimated impairment of accounts receivable
When there is objective evidence of impairment loss, the Corporation takes into consideration theestimation of future cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the differencebetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excludingfuture credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effectiveinterest rate. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss mayarise.
c. Fair value measurements and valuation processes
If some of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value have no quoted prices in activemarkets, the Corporation determines whether to engage third party qualified appraisers and determinesthe appropriate valuation techniques for the fair value measurements.
Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Corporation or engaged appraisers would determineappropriate inputs by referring to market prices or rates and specific features of derivatives. If the actualchanges of inputs in the future differ from expectation, the fair value might vary accordingly. TheCorporation updates inputs quarterly to confirm the appropriateness of the fair value measurement.
d. Impairment of property, plant and equipment
The impairment of equipment in relation to production is based on the recoverable amounts of thoseassets, which is the higher of their fair value less costs of disposal and their value in use. Any changesin the market prices or future cash flows will affect the recoverable amounts of those assets and maylead to a recognition of additional impairment losses or a reversal of impairment losses.
e. Write-down of inventoryThe net realizable value of inventory is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of businessless the estimated costs of completion and disposal. The estimation of net realizable value was based on
current market conditions and historical experience with product sales of a similar nature. Changes inmarket conditions may have a material impact on the estimation of the net realizable value.

f. Control over subsidiaries
Note 11 describes that Kunshan Chimei Materials Technology Corp. (“KSCMMT”) is a subsidiary ofthe Corporation although the Corporation only holds less than half of the voting power of KSCMMT.After considering the Corporation’s absolute size of holding in KSCMMT and the contractualarrangements between the Corporation and other investors, potential voting interests and other factors,management concluded that the Corporation has a sufficiently dominant voting interest to direct therelevant activities of KSCMMT, and therefore, the Corporation has control over KSCMMT.

b. Accounts receivable
The average credit period of sales of goods was between 90 and 120 days. In determining therecoverability of an account receivable, the Corporation considered any change in the credit quality ofthe account receivable since the date credit was initially granted to the end of the reporting period. TheCorporation recognized an allowance for impairment loss of 100% against all receivables over 120 daysbecause historical experience was that receivables that are beyond 120 days past due were notrecoverable. An allowance for impairment loss was recognized against accounts receivable between 60and 120 days based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past defaultexperience of the counterparties and an analysis of their current financial positions.
For the accounts receivable balances that were past due at the end of the reporting period, theCorporation did not recognize an allowance for impairment loss, because there was not a significantchange in credit quality and the amounts were still considered recoverable. The Corporation did nothold any collateral or other credit enhancements for these balances.
The aging of accounts receivable was as follows:
December 312017 2016Not past due $ 3,551,890 $ 2,981,461Less than 61 days - -61-90 days - -91-120 days - -

According to the Contract for State - Owned Construction Land Use Right Assignment between NBCMMTand Ningbo Municipal Bureau of National Land and Resource, the Corporation’s construction of industrialland should meet the requirements of production, tax revenue, and import and export quotas. However, dueto the changing business strategy for the production system in 2016, the Corporation might not meet all ofthe requirements. The Corporation assessed that the carrying amount of the construction in progress relatedto buildings and factories would not be recoverable, which led to the recognition of an impairment loss ofNT$291,090 in operating costs in the consolidated statements of comprehensive income for the year ended
December 31, 2016.

During 2017 and 2016, the Corporation breached certain terms of its long-term loan agreement, whichare primarily related to the interest coverage ratio of the Corporation. As of December 31, 2017 and2016, the carrying amount of the bank loan was NT$2,639,833 thousand and NT$1,345,181 thousand,respectively. On discovery of the breach, management informed the lender and commencedrenegotiation of the terms of the loan with the relevant banker. Since the lender has not agreed to waiveits right to demand immediate payment at the end of the reporting period, the loan was classified as acurrent liability at December 31, 2016. Up to the date of approval of issuance of the consolidatedfinancial statements, the negotiations were still in progress. Management is confident that itsnegotiations with the lender will ultimately succeed. Should the lender call for immediate repayment ofthe loan, management believes that adequate alternative sources of financing are available to ensure thatthere is no threat to the continuing operations of the Corporation.

2) Such capital surplus arises from the effect of a change in an ownership interest in a subsidiaryresulting from equity transactions other than an actual disposal or acquisition.
Retained earnings and dividend policy
In accordance with the amendments to the Company Act in May 2015, the recipients of dividends andbonuses are limited to shareholders and do not include employees. The shareholders held their regularmeeting on June 20, 2016 and, in that meeting, resolved amendments to the CMMT’s Articles ofIncorporation (the “Articles”), particularly the amendment to the policy on dividend distribution and theaddition of the policy on the distribution of employees’ compensation.
Under the dividend policy as set forth in the amended Articles, the current year’s earnings, if any, shallfirst be used to pay all taxes and offset prior years” accumulated losses, and then 10% shall be set asideas a legal reserve. When such legal reserve amounts to the total paid-in capital, CMMT shall not besubject to this requirement. CMMT may then appropriate or reverse a certain amount as a specialreserve according to the relevant regulations. The remaining earnings, plus the accumulatedundistributed earnings, may be appropriated to shareholders as dividends or bonuses according to thedistribution plan proposed by the board of directors and approved in the sharcholders’ meeting.
For the policies on the distribution of employees’ compensation and remuneration of directors andsupervisors after the amendment, refer to Note 22g, “Employee’s compensation and remuneration ofdirectors and supervisors”.
CMMT’s Articles also stipulate a dividend policy whereby, after taking into account CMMT's currentand future development plan, investment environment, fund requirements, domestic and internationalcompetition, and the interests of shareholders, CMMT is to set aside no less than 20% of thedistributable earnings as sharcholders’ dividends and bonuses. However, in the case where accumulateddistributable earnings is less than 50% of paid-in capital, CMMT may choose not to distributedividends. Dividends to common shareholders may be distributed by way of a combination of cashdividends and share dividends provided that the cash dividends shall not be less than 10% of the totaldividends.
An appropriation of earnings to legal reserve shall be made until the legal reserve equals CMMT’spaid-in capital. The legal reserve may be used to offset deficits. If CMMT has no deficit and the legalreserve has exceeded 25% of CMMT’s paid-in capital, the excess may be transferred to capital ordistributed in cash.
Items referred to under Rule No. 1010012865, Rule No. 1010047490 and Rule No. 1030006415 issuedby the FSC and the directive titled “Questions and Answers for Special Reserves AppropriatedFollowing Adoption of IFRSs” should be appropriated to or reversed from a special reserve by CMMT.
Except for non-ROC resident shareholders, all shareholders receiving dividends are allowed a tax creditequal to their proportionate share of the income tax paid by CMMT.

29. CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Corporation manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Corporation will be able to continue asgoing concerns while maximizing the return to shareholders through the optimization of the debt and equitybalance. The Corporation’s overall strategy remains unchanged.
The capital structure of the Corporation consists of net debt (borrowings offset by cash and cashequivalents) and equity of the Corporation (comprising issued capital, reserves, retained earnings, otherequity and non-controlling interests) and equity attributable to the owners of the Corporation (comprisingissued capital, reserves, retained earnings and other equity).
Key management personnel of the Corporation review the capital structure on a periodic basis. As part ofthis review, the key management personnel consider the cost of capital and the risks associated with eachclass of capital. Based on recommendations of the key management personnel, in order to balance theoverall capital structure, the Corporation may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders and/orthe number of new shares issued.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Corporation’s major financial instruments include equity, accounts receivable, accounts payable,and loans. The Corporation’s Corporate Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risksrelating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports which analyze exposures bydegree and magnitude of risk. These risks include market risk (including foreign currency risk, interestrate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Corporation sought to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instrumentsto hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives was governed by the Corporation’s policiesapproved by the board of directors, which provided written principles on foreign exchange risk, interestrate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and theinvestment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limitations was reviewed by theinternal auditors on a continuous basis. The Corporation did not enter into or trade financialinstruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function is an independent body that monitors risks and policies implementedto mitigate risk exposures.
1) Market risk
The Corporation’s activities exposed it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currencyexchange rates (see (a) below) and interest rates (see (b) below). The Corporation entered intoderivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest raterisk, including forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising ondollar-denominated assets generated by sales and yen-denominated liabilities generated by theimport of raw materials from Japan.
There had been no change to the Corporation’s exposure to market risks or the manner in whichthese risks were managed and measured.

===================================================
159.hocr: 
a)
b)
Foreign currency risk
The Corporation had foreign currency sales and purchases, which exposed the Corporation toforeign currency risk. Approximately 100% of the Corporation’s sales were denominated incurrencies other than the functional currency, whilst almost 84% of costs were denominated inthe Corporation’s functional currency. Exchange rate exposures were managed within approvedpolicy parameters utilizing foreign exchange forward contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets andmonetary liabilities (including those eliminated on consolidation) and of the derivatives exposedto foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period are set out in Note 36.
Sensitivity analysisThe Corporation was mainly exposed to the U.S. dollar and JPY.
The following table details the Corporation’s sensitivity to a 0.5% increase and decrease in theNew Taiwan dollar (the functional currency) against the relevant foreign currencies. Thesensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key managementpersonnel and representing management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change inforeign currency exchange rates is 0.5%. The sensitivity analysis included only outstandingforeign currency denominated monetary items and foreign currency forward contracts, andadjusts their translation at the end of the reporting period for a 0.5% change in foreign currencyrates. A positive number below indicates a decrease in the pre-tax profit associated with theNew Taiwan dollar strengthening 0.5% against the relevant currency. For a 0.5% weakening ofthe New Taiwan dollar against the relevant currency, there would be an equal and oppositeimpact on the pre-tax profit, and the balances below would be negative.

i. This was mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on U.S. dollar receivables, whichwere not hedged at the end of the reporting period.
ii. This was mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on JPY payables, which were nothedged at the end of the reporting period.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis was unrepresentative of the inherent foreignexchange risk because the exposure at the end of the reporting period did not reflect theexposure during the period.
Interest rate riskThe Corporation was exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Corporation borrowedfunds at fixed interest rates. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rate
views and a defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies areapplied.

The carrying amount of the Corporation’s financial assets and financial liabilities with exposureto interest rates at the end of the reporting period were as follows:

Fair value interest rate risk
Financial assets $ 588,119 $ 2,797,362
Financial liabilities 3,063,189 3,320,411Cash flow interest rate risk
Financial assets 4,164,439 1,661,171
Financial liabilities 3,490,252 1,496,218
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below were determined based on the Corporation’s exposure to interestrates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period. Forfloating rate assets and liabilities, the analysis was prepared assuming that the amount of theasset and liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the wholeyear. A 25 basis point increase or decrease was used when reporting interest rate risk internallyto key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonablypossible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 25 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant,the Corporation’s pre-tax profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 woulddecrease/increase by NT$1,685 thousand and NT$412 thousand, respectively.
2) Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resultingin a financial loss to the Corporation. As at the end of the reporting period, the Corporation’smaximum exposure to credit risk, which would cause a financial loss to the Corporation due to afailure of counterparties to discharge an obligation, could arise from the carrying amount of therespective recognized financial assets as stated in the balance sheets.
The Corporation adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtainingsufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss fromdefaults. The information that was evaluated by the Corporation about the credit ratings of thecounterparties is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, theCorporation uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rateits major customers. The Corporation’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties arecontinuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongstapproved counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed andapproved by the Corporation annually.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the accounts receivable and,where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Corporation’s concentration of credit risk of 69% and 84% in total accounts receivable as ofDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was related to the Corporation’s five largest customers.

3) Liquidity risk
The Corporation manages liquidity risk by monitoring and maintaining a level of cash and cashequivalents deemed adequate to finance the Corporation’s operations and mitigate the effects offluctuations in cash flows. In addition, management monitors the utilization of bank loans andensures compliance with loan covenants. However, the Corporation breached certain terms of itslong-term loan agreement during 2016. On discovery of the breach, management informed thelender and commenced renegotiation of the terms of the loan with the relevant banker. As of March19, 2018, those negotiations had not concluded. Refer to Note 16 for details.
The Corporation relies on bank loans as a significant source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2017and 2016, the Corporation had available unutilized short-term bank loan facilities set out in (c)below.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
The Board of Directors and ShareholdersChi Mei Materials Technology Corporation
Opinion
We have audited the accompanying financial statements of Chi Mei Materials Technology Corporation (theCorporation), which comprise the balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and the statements ofcomprehensive income, changes in equity and cash flows for the years then ended, and the notes to the financialstatements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying financial statements present fairly, in all material respects, the financialposition of the Corporation as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, and its financial performance and its cash flowsfor the years then ended in accordance with the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports bySecurities Issuers.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audits in accordance with the Regulations Governing Auditing and Attestation of FinancialStatements by Certified Public Accountants and auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China.Our responsibilities under those standards are further described in the Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit ofthe Financial Statements section of our report. We are independent of the Corporation in accordance with theNorm of Professional Ethics for Certified Public Accountant of the Republic of China, and we have fulfilled ourother ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements. We believe that the audit evidence we haveobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgment, were of most significance in our audit ofthe financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017. These matters were addressed in the context ofour audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide aseparate opinion on these matters.
Key audit matters for the Corporation’s financial statement for the year ended December 31, 2017 are stated asfollows:
Timing of Revenue Recognition
The Corporation’s major source of revenue comes from the sale of polarizing film. This kind of revenue ismainly recognized when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods are transferred to thecustomers upon delivery to carriers approved by the customers or to the designated destination. However, thereremains a risk of revenue not being recorded in an appropriate period before the significant risks and rewards ofownership of the goods have been transferred to the customers where physical deliveries have not been fulfilled.As a result, we considered timing for revenue recognition as a key audit matter. Refer to Note 4 to the financialstatements for detailed information on revenue recognition.
Our main audit procedures performed in respect of the above area include the following:1. Considered the Corporation’s accounting policy for revenue recognition;2. Evaluated and tested the design and operating effectiveness of internal controls over revenue recognition;
3. Selected all samples of shipments before and after the year-end for a specific period of time and vouched forsupporting evidence and records to ensure the accuracy of the timing of revenue recognition;

This section shall state all forms of remuneration that the Director has received from the Company's invested businesses other than subsidiaries.b. For directors who receive remuneration from invested businesses other than the subsidiaries, the amount of remuneration from these invested businesses should be added to column I'in thetable of remuneration ranges and please change the column heading into All invested businesses” in such case:c.

4. Evaluated whether the risks and rewards of ownership for the goods had been transferred.
Impairment Assessment of Property, Plant and Equipment (PP&E) and Intangible Assets

When an indication of an asset’s impairment exists, management should perform an impairment assessment,which incorporates judgments based on assumptions about the future profitability for the related businessesagainst which appropriate long-term growth rates and discount rates must be applied. Management’s estimationabout the recoverable amounts of PP&E and intangible assets is complicated and has significant uncertainty,especially in the assumptions surrounding the estimated discount rate and future expected cash flows, whichdepended on changing economic or market trends. Therefore, the impairment assesment of PP&E and intangibleassets is identified as a key audit matter. Refer to Notes 4, 5, 12 and 14 to the financial statements for the detailsabout PP&E and intangible assets.
We inquired of management and understood the process and basis by which management assessed assets forimpairment assessment; and tested the effectiveness of the Corporation’s internal control. We also challengedthe assumptions underpinning the impairment assessment models, including the discount rates used, long-termgrowth rates and cash flow forecasts. This was achieved through the assistance of Deloitte valuation specialistscritically assessing the discount rate and long-term growth rates applied by management and assessing thereasonableness of forecasted future cash flows by comparison to historical performance and future outlook.
Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of the financial statements in accordancewith the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers and for such internalcontrol as management determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are freefrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Corporation’s ability tocontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the goingconcern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Corporation or to ceaseoperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance, including the audit committee, are responsible for overseeing the Corporation’sfinancial reporting process.

===================================================
181.hocr: 
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are freefrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes ouropinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted inaccordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China will always detect a materialmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if,individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of userstaken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with the auditing standards generally accepted in the Republic of China, weexercise professional judgment and maintain professional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
1. Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud orerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that issufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a materialmisstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion,forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
2. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theCorporation’s internal control.
3. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates andrelated disclosures made by management.
4. Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that maycast significant doubt on the Corporation’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that amaterial uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosuresin the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions arebased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditors’ report. However, future events orconditions may cause the Corporation to cease to continue as a going concern.
5. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner thatachieves fair presentation.
6. Obtain sufficient and appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of entities or businessactivities within the Corporation to express an opinion on the financial statements. We are responsible forthe direction, supervision, and performance of the audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with those charged with governance regarding, among other matters, the planned scope andtiming of the audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control thatwe identify during our audit.
We also provide those charged with governance with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical
requirements regarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters thatmay reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

===================================================
182.hocr: 
From the matters communicated with those charged with governance, we determine those matters that were ofmost significance in the audit of the financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2017 and aretherefore the key audit matters. We describe these matters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulationprecludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that amatter should not be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so wouldreasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2010-2012 Cycle
Several standards, including IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”, IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” andIFRS 8 “Operating Segments”, were amended in this annual improvement.
IFRS 3 was amended to clarify that contingent consideration should be measured at fair valueirrespective of whether the contingent consideration is a financial instrument within the scope ofIFRS 9 or IAS 39. Changes in fair value should be recognized in profit or loss.
The amended IFRS 8 requires the Corporation to disclose the judgments made by management inapplying the aggregation criteria to operating segments, including a description of the operatingsegments aggregated and the economic indicators assessed in determining whether the operatingsegments have “similar economic characteristics”. The amendment also clarifies that areconciliation of the total of the reportable segments’ assets to the entity’s assets should only beprovided if the segments’ assets are regularly provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
When the amended IFRS 13 becomes effective in 2017, the short-term receivables and payableswith no stated interest rate will be measured at their invoice amounts without discounting, if theeffect of not discounting is immaterial.
IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures” was amended to clarify that a management entity providing keymanagement personnel services to the Corporation is a related party of the Corporation.Consequently, the Corporation is required to disclose as related party transactions the amountsincurred for the services paid or payable to the management entity for the provision of keymanagement personnel services. However, disclosure of the components of such compensation isnot required.
Annual Improvements to IFRSs 2011-2013 CycleSeveral standards, including IFRS 3 and IFRS 13, were amended in this annual improvement.
The scope in IFRS 13 of the portfolio exception for measuring the fair value of a group of financialassets and financial liabilities on a net basis was amended to clarify that it includes all contracts thatare within the scope of, and accounted for in accordance with, IAS 39 or IFRS 9, even thosecontracts which do not meet the definitions of financial assets or financial liabilities within IAS 32.
Amendments to IAS 16 and IAS 38 “Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation andAmortization”
The amendments stipulate that an entity should use appropriate depreciation and amortizationmethods to reflect the pattern in which the future economic benefits of property, plant andequipment and intangible assets are expected to be consumed by the entity.
The amended IAS 16 “Property, Plant and Equipment” stipulates that a depreciation method that is
based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use of an asset is not appropriate.The amended standard does not provide any exception from this requirement.
- 186 -
===================================================
191.hocr: 
The amended IAS 38 “Intangible Assets” clarifies there is a rebuttable presumption that anamortization method that is based on revenue that is generated by an activity that includes the use ofan intangible asset is not appropriate. This presumption can be overcome only in the followinglimited circumstances:
a) In which an intangible asset is expressed as a measure of revenue (for example, a contract thatspecifies that the entity’s use of the intangible asset will expire upon achievement of a revenuethreshold); or
b) When it can be demonstrated that revenue and the consumption of the economic benefits of anintangible asset are highly correlated.
5) Amendments to the Regulations Governing the Preparation of Financial Reports by SecuritiesIssuers
The amendments include additions of several accounting items and requirements for disclosures ofthe impairment of non-financial assets as a consequence of the IFRSs endorsed and issued intoeffect by the FSC. In addition, as a result of the post implementation review of IFRSs in Taiwan, theamendments also include an emphasis on certain recognition and measurement considerations andadd requirements for disclosures of related party transactions and goodwill.
The amendments stipulate that other companies or institutions of which the chairman of the boardof directors or president serves as the chairman of the board of directors or the president of theCorporation, or is the spouse or second immediate family of the chairman of the board of directorsor president of the Corporation are deemed to have a substantive related party relationship, unless itcan be demonstrated that no control, joint control, or significant influence exists. Furthermore, theamendments require the disclosure of the names of the related parties and the relationships withwhom the Corporation has significant transactions. If the transactions or balance with a specificrelated party is 10% or more of the Corporation’s respective total transactions or balance, suchtransactions should be separately disclosed by the name of each related party.
When the amendments are applied retrospectively starting from January 1, 2017, the disclosures ofrelated party transactions are enhanced. Refer to Note 28 for related disclosures.

Note 1: Unless stated otherwise, the above New IFRSs are effective for annual periods beginning onor after their respective effective dates.
Note 2: The amendment to IFRS 12 is retrospectively applied for annual periods beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 2017; the amendment to IAS 28 is retrospectively applied for annual periods
beginning on or after January 1, 2018.
The initial application of the above New IFRSs, whenever applied, would not have any material impacton the Corporation’s accounting policies, except for the following:
1) IFRS 9 “Financial Instruments” and related amendment

Classification, measurement and impairment of financial assets
With regard to financial assets, all recognized financial assets that are within the scope of IAS 39“Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement” are subsequently measured at amortizedcost or fair value. Under IFRS 9, the requirement for the classification of financial assets is statedbelow.
For the Corporation’s debt instruments that have contractual cash flows that are solely payments ofprincipal and interest on the principal amount outstanding, their classification and measurement areas follows:
a) For debt instruments, if they are held within a business model whose objective is to collectcontractual cash flows, the financial assets are measured at amortized cost and are assessed forimpairment continuously with any impairment loss recognized in profit or loss. Interest revenueis recognized in profit or loss by using the effective interest method;
b) For debt instruments, if they are held within a business model whose objective is achieved byboth collecting contractual cash flows and selling financial assets, the financial assets aremeasured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI) and are assessed forimpairment. Interest revenue is recognized in profit or loss by using the effective interestmethod, and other gains or losses are recognized in other comprehensive income, except forimpairment gains or losses and foreign exchange gains and losses. When the debt instrumentsare derecognized or reclassified, the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in othercomprehensive income is reclassified from equity to profit or loss.
Except for the above, all other financial assets are measured at fair value through profit or loss.However, the Corporation may make an irrevocable election to present subsequent changes in thefair value of an equity investment (that is not held for trading) in other comprehensive income, withonly dividend income generally recognized in profit or loss. No subsequent impairment assessmentis required, and the cumulative gain or loss previously recognized in other comprehensive incomecannot be reclassified from equity to profit or loss.

The Corporation elects not to restate prior reporting periods when applying the requirements for theclassification, measurement and impairment of financial assets under IFRS 9 with the cumulativeeffect of the initial application recognized at the date of initial application and will provide thedisclosures related to the classification and the adjustment information upon initial application ofIFRS 9.
The anticipated impact on assets, liabilities and equity of retrospective application of therequirements for the classification, measurement and impairment of financial assets as of January 1,2018 is set out below:
Carrying Adjustments AdjustedAmount as of Arising from CarryingDecember 31, Initial Amount as of2017 Application January 1, 2018Impact on assets, liabilities and equityOther financial assets $ 2,000 $ (2,000) $ -Financial assets measured at amortizedcost - current - 2.000 2.000Total effect on assets $ 2,000 $ - $ 2,000
IFRS 15 “Revenue from Contracts with Customers” and the related amendment
IFRS 15 establishes principles for recognizing revenue that apply to all contracts with customers,and will supersede IAS 18 “Revenue”, IAS 11 “Construction Contracts” and a number ofrevenue-related interpretations.
When applying IFRS 15, the Corporation recognizes revenue by applying the following steps:
Identify the contract with the customer;
Identify the performance obligations in the contract;
Determine the transaction price;
Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract; andRecognize revenue when the Corporation satisfies a performance obligation.
In addition, the Corporation will disclose the difference between the amount that results fromapplying IFRS 15 and the amount that results from applying current standards for 2018.
The anticipated effect of retrospectively applying IFRS 15 is detailed below:

- 189 -
===================================================
194.hocr: 
3) Amendments to IAS 12 “Recognition of Deferred Tax Assets for Unrealized Losses”
The amendments clarify that the difference between the carrying amount of a debt instrumentmeasured at fair value and its tax base gives rise to a temporary difference, even though there areunrealized losses on that asset, irrespective of whether the Corporation expects to recover thecarrying amount of the debt instrument by sale or by holding it and collecting contractual cashflows.
In addition, in determining whether to recognize a deferred tax asset, the Corporation should assessa deductible temporary difference in combination with all of its other deductible temporarydifferences, unless the tax law restricts the utilization of losses as deduction against income of aspecific type, in which case, a deductible temporary difference is assessed in combination only withother deductible temporary differences of the appropriate type. The amendments also stipulate that,when determining whether to recognize a deferred tax asset, the estimate of probable future taxableprofit may include some of the Corporation’s assets for more than their carrying amount if there issufficient evidence that it is probable that the Corporation will achieve the higher amount, and thatthe estimate for future taxable profit should exclude tax deductions resulting from the reversal ofdeductible temporary differences.
In assessing a deferred tax asset, the Corporation currently assumes it will recover the asset at itscarrying amount when estimating probable future taxable profit; the amendments will be applied
retrospectively in 2018.
Except for the above impact, as of the date the financial statements were authorized for issue, theCorporation is continuously assessing the possible impact that the application of other standards andinterpretations will have on the Corporation’s financial position and financial performance and will
disclose the relevant impact when the assessment is completed.

===================================================
195.hocr: 
1) IFRS 16 “Leases”
IFRS 16 sets out the accounting standards for leases that will supersede IAS 17 and a number ofrelated interpretations.
Under IFRS 16, if the Corporation is a lessee, it shall recognize right-of-use assets and leaseliabilities for all leases on the balance sheets except for low-value and short-term leases. TheCorporation may elect to apply the accounting method similar to the accounting for operating leasesunder IAS 17 to low-value and short-term leases. On the statements of comprehensive income, theCorporation should present the depreciation expense charged on right-of-use assets separately fromthe interest expense accrued on lease liabilities; interest is computed by using the effective interestmethod. On the statements of cash flows, cash payments for the principal portion of lease liabilitiesare classified within financing activities; cash payments for the interest portion are classified withinoperating activities.
The application of IFRS 16 is not expected to have a material impact on the accounting of theCorporation as lessor.
When IFRS 16 becomes effective, the Corporation may elect to apply this standard eitherretrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effectof the initial application of this standard recognized at the date of initial application.
2) IFRIC 23 “Uncertainty Over Income Tax Treatments”
IFRIC 23 clarifies that when there is uncertainty over income tax treatments, the Corporation shouldassume that the taxation authority will have full knowledge of all related information when makingrelated examinations. If the Corporation concludes that it is probable that the taxation authority willaccept an uncertain tax treatment, the Corporation should determine the taxable profit, tax bases,unused tax losses, unused tax credits or tax rates consistently with the tax treatments used orplanned to be used in its income tax filings. If it is not probable that the taxation authority willaccept an uncertain tax treatment, the Corporation should make estimates using either the mostlikely amount or the expected value of the tax treatment, depending on which method the entityexpects to better predict the resolution of the uncertainty. The Corporation has to reassess itsjudgments and estimates if facts and circumstances change.
On initial application, the Corporation shall apply IFRIC 23 either retrospectively to each priorreporting period presented, if this is possible without the use of hindsight, or retrospectively withthe cumulative effect of the initial application of IFRIC 23 recognized at the date of initialapplication.
Except for the above impact, as of the date the financial statements were authorized for issue, theCorporation is continuously assessing the possible impact that the application of other standards andinterpretations will have on the Corporation’s financial position and financial performance and willdisclose the relevant impact when the assessment is completed.
4. SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a. Statement of compliance
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the Regulations Governing thePreparation of Financial Reports by Securities Issuers.
-191 -
===================================================
196.hocr: 
b. Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for financial instrumentswhich are measured at fair value.
The fair value measurements are grouped into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair valuemeasurement inputs are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement inits entirety, which are described as follows:
1) Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
2) Level 2 inputs are inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable forthe asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
3) Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.When preparing these parent company only financial statements, the Corporation used the equitymethod to account for its investments in subsidiaries. In order for the amounts of the net profit for theyear, other comprehensive income for the year and total equity in these financial statements to be thesame with the amounts attributable to the owners of the Corporation in its consolidated financialstatements, adjustments arising from the differences in accounting treatments between the parentcompany only basis and the consolidated basis were made to investments accounted for using the equitymethod, the share of profit or loss of subsidiaries, the share of other comprehensive income ofsubsidiaries and the related equity items, as appropriate, in these financial statements.
c. Classification of current and non-current assets and liabilitiesCurrent assets include:1) Assets held primarily for the purpose of trading;
2) Assets expected to be realized within 12 months after the reporting period; and
3) Cash and cash equivalents unless the asset is restricted from being exchanged or used to settle aliability for at least 12 months after the reporting period.
Current liabilities include:1) Liabilities held primarily for the purpose of trading;2) Liabilities due to be settled within 12 months after the reporting period; and
3) Liabilities for which the Corporation does not have an unconditional right to defer settlement for atleast 12 months after the reporting period.
Assets and liabilities that are not classified as current are classified as non-current.d. Business combinations
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. Acquisition-related costs aregenerally recognized in profit or loss as they are incurred.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of anynon-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the Corporation’s previously held equityinterests in the acquiree over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets acquiredand the liabilities assumed.
-192 -
===================================================
197.hocr: 
Non-controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionateshare of the entity’s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initially measured at thenon-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identifiablenet assets.
Foreign currencies
In preparing these financial statements, transactions in currencies other than the Corporation’sfunctional currency (i.e. foreign currencies) are recognized at the rates of exchange prevailing at thedates of the transactions.
At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslatedat the rates prevailing at that date. Exchange differences on monetary items arising from settlement ortranslation are recognized in profit or loss in the period in which they arise.
Non-monetary items measured at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslatedat the rates prevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Exchange differences arisingfrom the retranslation of non-monetary items are included in profit or loss for the period except forexchange differences arising from the retranslation of non-monetary items in respect of which gains andlosses are recognized directly in other comprehensive income, in which case, the exchange differencesare also recognized directly in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary items that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using theexchange rate at the date of the transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Corporation’s entire interest in a foreignoperation, or a disposal involving the loss of control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operationof which the retained interest becomes a financial asset), all of the exchange differences accumulated inequity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Corporation are reclassified to profitor loss.
Inventories
Inventories consist of raw materials, finished goods and work in progress and are stated at the lower ofcost or net realizable value. Inventory write-downs are made by item, except where it may beappropriate to group similar or related items. Net realizable value is the estimated selling price ofinventories less all estimated costs of completion and costs necessary to make the sale. Inventories arerecorded at the weighted-average cost on the balance sheet date.
Investments in subsidiaries
The Corporation uses the equity method to account for its investments in subsidiaries.
Subsidiary is an entity that is controlled by the Corporation.
Under the equity method, an investment in a subsidiary is initially recognized at cost and adjustedthereafter to recognize the Corporation’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income ofthe subsidiary. The Corporation also recognizes the changes in the Corporation’s share of equity ofsubsidiaries.
Changes in the Corporation’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in the Corporationlosing control of the subsidiary are equity transactions. The Corporation recognizes directly in equity
any difference between the carrying amount of the investment and the fair value of the considerationpaid or received.
-193 -
===================================================
198.hocr: 
When the Corporation’s share of losses of a subsidiary exceeds its interest in that subsidiary (whichincludes any carrying amount of the investment accounted for using the equity method and long-terminterests that, in substance, form part of the Corporation’s net investment in the subsidiary), theCorporation continues recognizing its share of further losses.
The Corporation assesses its investment for any impairment by comparing the carrying amount with theestimated recoverable amount as assessed based on the entire financial statements of the investee.Impairment loss is recognized when the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. If therecoverable amount of the investment subsequently increases, the Corporation recognizes the reversalof the impairment loss; the adjusted post-reversal carrying amount should not exceed the carryingamount that would have been recognized (net of amortization or depreciation) had no impairment lossbeen recognized in prior years. An impairment loss recognized on goodwill cannot be reversed in asubsequent period.
When the Corporation loses control of a subsidiary, it recognizes the investment retained in the formersubsidiary at its fair value at the date when control is lost. The difference between the fair value of theretained investment plus any consideration received and the carrying amount of the previous investmentat the date when control is lost is recognized as a gain or loss in profit or loss. Besides, the Corporationaccounts for all amounts previously recognized in other comprehensive income in relation to thatsubsidiary on the same basis as would be required if the Corporation had directly disposed of the relatedassets or liabilities.
Profits or losses resulting from downstream transactions are eliminated in full only in the Corporation’sparent company only financial statements. Profits and losses resulting from upstream transactions andtransactions between subsidiaries are recognized only in the parent company only financial statementsonly to the extent of interests in the subsidiaries that are not related to the Corporation.
Property, plant, and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulatedimpairment loss.
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction are carried at cost less any recognizedimpairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and borrowing costs eligible for capitalization. Suchassets are depreciated and classified to the appropriate categories of property, plant and equipmentwhen completed and ready for their intended use.
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized using the straight-line method. Eachsignificant part is depreciated separately. The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciationmethod are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of any changes in theestimates accounted for on a prospective basis.
On derecognition of an item of property, plant and equipment, the difference between the sales proceedsand the carrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.
Intangible assets1) Intangible assets acquired separately
Intangible assets with finite useful lives that are acquired separately are initially measured at costand subsequently measured at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment loss.Amortization is recognized on a straight-line basis. The estimated useful lives, residual values, andamortization method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effects of anychanges in the estimates accounted for on a prospective basis. Intangible assets with indefiniteuseful lives that are acquired separately are measured at cost less accumulated impairment loss.
- 194 -
===================================================
199.hocr: 
2) Derecognition of intangible assets
On derecognition of an intangible asset, the difference between the net disposal proceeds and thecarrying amount of the asset is recognized in profit or loss.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets
At the end of each reporting period, the Corporation reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible andintangible assets, excluding goodwill, to determine whether there is any indication that those assetshave suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset isestimated in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss. When it is not possible to estimate therecoverable amount of an individual asset, the Corporation estimates the recoverable amount of thecash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.
The recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. If the recoverableamount of an asset or cash-generating unit is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carryingamount of the asset or cash-generating unit is reduced to its recoverable amount, with the resultingimpairment loss recognized in profit or loss.
When an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset or cash-generatingunit is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent of the carryingamount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been recognized for the asset orcash-generating unit in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognized in profit or loss.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognized when the Corporation becomes a party to thecontractual provisions of the instruments.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that aredirectly attributable to the acquisition or issue of financial assets and financial liabilities (other thanfinancial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deductedfrom the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition.Transaction costs directly attributable to the acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fairvalue through profit or loss are recognized immediately in profit or loss.

b) Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicatorsof impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets are considered to be impairedwhen there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after theinitial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment havebeen affected.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, such as accounts receivable and otherreceivables, such assets are assessed for impairment on a collective basis even if they wereassessed not to be impaired individually. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio ofreceivables could include the Corporation’s past experience of collecting payments, an increasein the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period of 60 days, aswell as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with defaultson receivables.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognized isthe difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated futurecash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
For financial assets measured at amortized cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of theimpairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an event occurring afterthe impairment was recognized, the previously recognized impairment loss is reversed throughprofit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairmentis reversed does not exceed what the amortized cost would have been had the impairment notbeen recognized.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for allfinancial assets with the exception of accounts receivable and other receivables where thecarrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When accounts receivableand other receivables are considered uncollectible, they are written off against the allowanceaccount. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against theallowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognized inprofit or loss except for uncollectible accounts receivable and other receivables that are writtenoff against the allowance account.
¢) Derecognition of financial assets
The Corporation derecognizes a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cashflows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risksand rewards of ownership of the asset to another party.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the asset’s carryingamount and the sum of the consideration received and receivable and the cumulative gain orloss that had been recognized in other comprehensive income is recognized in profit or loss.
2) Financial liabilities
a) Subsequent measurement
Except for financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss, all the financial liabilities aremeasured at amortized cost using the effective interest method.
- 196 -
===================================================
201.hocr: 
b) Derecognition of financial liabilities
The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability derecognized and theconsideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferred or liabilities assumed, isrecognized in profit or loss.
3) Derivative financial instruments
The Corporation enters into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure tointerest rate and foreign exchange rate risks, including foreign exchange forward contracts.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered intoand are subsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. Theresulting gain or loss is recognized in profit or loss immediately unless the derivative is designatedand effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in profit or lossdepends on the nature of the hedge relationship. When the fair value of derivative financialinstruments is positive, the derivative is recognized as a financial asset; when the fair value ofderivative financial instruments is negative, the derivative is recognized as a financial liability.
Provisions
Provisions are measured at the best estimate of the discounted cash flows of the consideration requiredto settle the present obligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks anduncertainties surrounding the obligation.
. Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reducedfor estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances. Allowance for sales returns andliability for returns are recognized at the time of sale based on the seller’s reliable estimate of futurereturns and based on past experience and other relevant factors.
1) Sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when all the following conditions are satisfied:
a) The Corporation has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership ofthe goods;
b) The Corporation retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usuallyassociated with ownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
¢) The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
d) It is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to theCorporation; and
e) The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.
The Corporation does not recognize sales revenue on materials delivered to subcontractors becausethis delivery does not involve a transfer of risks and rewards of the materials’ ownership.

===================================================
202.hocr: 
2) RoyaltiesRoyalty revenue is recognized on an accrual basis in accordance with the substance of the relevantagreement and provided that it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Corporationand that the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Royalties determined on a time basis arerecognized on a straight-line basis over the period of the agreement. Royalty arrangements that arebased on production, sales and other measures are recognized by reference to the underlyingarrangement.
3) Interest incomeInterest income from a financial asset is recognized when it is probable that the economic benefitswill flow to the Corporation and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income isaccrued on a time basis by reference to the principal outstanding and at the applicable effectiveinterest rate.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risksand rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevantlease.
Borrowing costsBorrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assetsare added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their
intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending theirexpenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization.
Other than stated above, all other borrowing costs are recognized in profit or loss in the period in whichthey are incurred.
Government grants
Government grants are not recognized until there is reasonable assurance that the Corporation willcomply with the conditions attached to them and that the grants will be received.
Government grants that are receivable as compensation for expenses or losses already incurred or forthe purpose of giving immediate financial support to the Corporation with no future related costs arerecognized in profit or loss in the period in which they become receivable.
Employee benefits
1) Short-term employee benefits
Liabilities recognized in respect of short-term employee benefits are measured at the undiscountedamount of the benefits expected to be paid in exchange for the related service.
2) Retirement benefits
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are recognized as an expense whenemployees have rendered service entitling them to the contributions.

Current tax
According to the Income Tax Law, an additional tax at 10% of unappropriated earnings is providedfor as income tax in the year the shareholders approve to retain the earnings.
Adjustments of prior years’ tax liabilities are added to or deducted from the current year’s taxprovision.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxable temporary differences. Deferred taxassets are generally recognized for all deductible temporary differences, unused loss carryforwardsand unused tax credits for purchases of machinery, equipment and technology, research anddevelopment expenditures, and personnel training expenditures to the extent that it is probable thattaxable profits will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can beutilized.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investmentsin subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint arrangements, except where the Corporation isable to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporarydifference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductibletemporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognized to theextent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilize thebenefits of the temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period andreduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available toallow all or part of the asset to be recovered. A previously unrecognized deferred tax asset is alsoreviewed at the end of each reporting period and recognized to the extent that it has becomeprobable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in theperiod in which the liability is settled or the asset is realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) thathave been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement ofdeferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the mannerin which the Corporation expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carryingamount of its assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred tax for the yearCurrent and deferred tax are recognized in profit or loss, except when they relate to items that are
recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current anddeferred tax are also recognized in other comprehensive income or directly in equity, respectively.

5. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATIONUNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Corporation’s accounting policies, management is required to make judgments,estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparentfrom other sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and otherfactors that are considered relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accountingestimates are recognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that periodor in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
a. Income taxes
As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, the carrying amount of deferred tax assets in relation to unused taxlosses and future deductible temporary differences was NT$417,137 thousand and NT$272,591thousand, respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, no deferred tax asset has been recognizedon tax losses and future deductible temporary differences of NT$356,483 thousand and NT$262,138thousand, respectively, due to the unpredictability of future profit streams. The realizability of deferredtax assets mainly depends on whether sufficient future profits or taxable temporary differences will beavailable. In cases where the actual future profits generated are less than expected, a material reversal ofdeferred tax assets may arise, which would be recognized in profit or loss for the period in which such areversal takes place.
b. Estimated impairment of accounts receivable
When there is objective evidence of impairment loss, the Corporation takes into consideration theestimation of future cash flows. The amount of the impairment loss is measured as the differencebetween the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows (excludingfuture credit losses that have not been incurred) discounted at the financial asset’s original effectiveinterest rate. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss mayarise.
c. Fair value measurements and valuation processes
If some of the Corporation’s assets and liabilities measured at fair value have no quoted prices in activemarkets, the Corporation determines whether to engage third party qualified appraisers and determinesthe appropriate valuation techniques for the fair value measurements.
Where Level 1 inputs are not available, the Corporation or engaged appraisers would determineappropriate inputs by referring to market prices or rates and specific features of derivatives. If the actualchanges of inputs in the future differ from expectation, the fair value might vary accordingly. TheCorporation updates inputs quarterly to confirm the appropriateness of the fair value measurement.
d. Write-down of inventoryThe net realizable value of inventory is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of businessless the estimated costs of completion and disposal. The estimation of net realizable value was based on
current market conditions and historical experience with product sales of a similar nature. Changes inmarket conditions may have a material impact on the estimation of the net realizable value.

The average credit period of sales of goods was between 90 and 120 days. In determining therecoverability of an account receivable, the Corporation considered any change in the credit quality ofthe account receivable since the date credit was initially granted to the end of the reporting period. TheCorporation recognized an allowance for impairment loss of 100% against all receivables over 120 daysbecause historical experience was that receivables that are beyond 120 days past due were notrecoverable. An allowance for impairment loss was recognized against accounts receivable between 60and 120 days based on estimated irrecoverable amounts determined by reference to past defaultexperience of the counterparties and an analysis of their current financial positions.
For the accounts receivable balances that were past due at the end of the reporting period, theCorporation did not recognize an allowance for impairment loss, because there was not a significantchange in credit quality and the amounts were still considered recoverable. The Corporation did nothold any collateral or other credit enhancements for these balances.

Retained earnings and dividend policy
In accordance with the amendments to the Company Act in May 2015, the recipients of dividends andbonuses are limited to shareholders and do not include employees. The shareholders held their regularmeeting on June 20, 2016 and, in that meeting, resolved amendments to the Corporation’s Articles ofIncorporation (the “Articles”), particularly the amendment to the policy on dividend distribution and theaddition of the policy on the distribution of employees’ compensation.
Under the dividend policy as set forth in the amended Articles, the current year’s earnings, if any, shallfirst be used to pay all taxes and offset prior years” accumulated losses, and then 10% shall be set asideas a legal reserve. When such legal reserve amounts to the total paid-in capital, the Corporation shallnot be subject to this requirement. The Corporation may then appropriate or reverse a certain amount asa special reserve according to the relevant regulations. The remaining earnings, plus the accumulatedundistributed earnings, may be appropriated to shareholders as dividends or bonuses according to thedistribution plan proposed by the board of directors and approved in the shareholders’ meeting.
For the policies on the distribution of employees’ compensation and remuneration of directors andsupervisors after the amendment, refer to Note 20g, “Employee’s compensation and remuneration ofdirectors and supervisors”.
The Corporation’s Articles also stipulate a dividend policy whereby, after taking into account theCorporation’s current and future development plan, investment environment, fund requirements,domestic and international competition, and the interests of shareholders, the Corporation is to set asideno less than 20% of the distributable earnings as shareholders’ dividends and bonuses. However, in thecase where accumulated distributable earnings is less than 50% of paid-in capital, the Corporation maychoose not to distribute dividends. Dividends to common shareholders may be distributed by way of acombination of cash dividends and share dividends provided that the cash dividends shall not be lessthan 10% of the total dividends.
An appropriation of earnings to a legal reserve shall be made until the legal reserve equals theCorporation’s paid-in capital. The legal reserve may be used to offset deficits. If the Corporation has nodeficit and the legal reserve has exceeded 25% of the Corporation’s paid-in capital, the excess may betransferred to capital or distributed in cash.
Items referred to under Rule No. 1010012865, Rule No. 1010047490 and Rule No. 1030006415 issuedby the FSC and the directive titled “Questions and Answers for Special Reserves AppropriatedFollowing Adoption of IFRSs” should be appropriated to or reversed from a special reserve by theCorporation.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Corporation’s major financial instruments include equity, accounts receivable, accounts payable,and loans. The Corporation’s Corporate Treasury function monitors and manages the financial risksrelating to the operations of the Corporation through internal risk reports which analyze exposures bydegree and magnitude of risk. These risks include market risk (including foreign currency risk, interestrate risk and other price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Corporation sought to minimize the effects of these risks by using derivative financial instrumentsto hedge risk exposures. The use of financial derivatives was governed by the Corporation’s policiesapproved by the board of directors, which provided written principles on foreign exchange risk, interestrate risk, credit risk, the use of financial derivatives and non-derivative financial instruments, and theinvestment of excess liquidity. Compliance with policies and exposure limitations was reviewed by theinternal auditors on a continuous basis. The Corporation did not enter into or trade financialinstruments, including derivative financial instruments, for speculative purposes.
The Corporate Treasury function is an independent body that monitors risks and policies implementedto mitigate risk exposures.
1) Market risk
The Corporation’s activities exposed it primarily to the financial risk of changes in foreign currencyexchange rates (see (a) below) and interest rates (see (b) below). The Corporation entered intoderivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk and interest raterisk, including forward foreign exchange contracts to hedge the exchange rate risk arising ondollar-denominated assets generated by sales and yen-denominated liabilities generated by theimport of raw materials from Japan.
There had been no change to the Corporation’s exposure to market risks or the manner in whichthese risks were managed and measured.
a) Foreign currency risk
The Corporation had foreign currency sales and purchases, which exposed the Corporation toforeign currency risk. Approximately 100% of the Corporation’s sales were denominated incurrencies other than the functional currency, whilst almost 98% of costs were denominated inthe Corporation’s functional currency. Exchange rate exposures were managed within approvedpolicy parameters utilizing forward foreign exchange contracts.
The carrying amounts of the Corporation’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets andmonetary liabilities (including those eliminated on consolidation) and of the derivatives exposedto foreign currency risk at the end of the reporting period are set out in Note 32.
Sensitivity analysis
The Corporation was mainly exposed to the U.S. dollar and JPY.
The following table details the Corporation’s sensitivity to a 0.5% increase and decrease in theNew Taiwan dollar (the functional currency) against the relevant foreign currencies. Thesensitivity rate used when reporting foreign currency risk internally to key managementpersonnel and representing management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change inforeign currency exchange rates is 0.5%. The sensitivity analysis included only outstandingforeign currency denominated monetary items and foreign currency forward contracts, andadjusts their translation at the end of the reporting period for a 0.5% change in foreign currencyrates. A positive number below indicates a decrease in the pre-tax profit associated with the

i. This was mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on U.S. dollar receivables, whichwere not hedged at the end of the reporting period.
ii. This was mainly attributable to the exposure outstanding on JPY payables, which were nothedged at the end of the reporting period.
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis was unrepresentative of the inherent foreignexchange risk because the exposure at the end of the reporting period did not reflect theexposure during the period.
Interest rate risk
The Corporation was exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Corporation borrowedfunds at fixed interest rates. Hedging activities are evaluated regularly to align with interest rateviews and a defined risk appetite, ensuring the most cost-effective hedging strategies areapplied.
The carrying amount of the Corporation’s financial assets and financial liabilities with exposureto interest rates at the end of the reporting period were as follows:
December 312017 2016Fair value interest rate riskFinancial assets $ 2,000 $ 129,000Financial liabilities 1,251,999 2,800,535Cash flow interest rate riskFinancial assets 2,857,187 1,162,328
Sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analysis below were determined based on the Corporation’s exposure to interestrates for both derivative and non-derivative instruments at the end of the reporting period. Forfloating rate assets and liabilities, the analysis was prepared assuming that the amount of theasset and liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was outstanding for the wholeyear. A 25 basis point increase or decrease was used when reporting interest rate risk internallyto key management personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonablypossible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 25 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant,
the Corporation’s pre-tax profit for the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016 woulddecrease/increase by NT$7,143 thousand and NT$2,906 thousand, respectively.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resultingin a financial loss to the Corporation. As at the end of the reporting period, the Corporation’smaximum exposure to credit risk, which would cause a financial loss to the Corporation due to afailure of counterparties to discharge an obligation, could arise from the carrying amount of therespective recognized financial assets as stated in the balance sheets.
The Corporation adopted a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtainingsufficient collateral, where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of financial loss fromdefaults. The information that was evaluated by the Corporation about the credit ratings of thecounterparties is supplied by independent rating agencies where available and, if not available, theCorporation uses other publicly available financial information and its own trading records to rateits major customers. The Corporation’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties arecontinuously monitored and the aggregate value of transactions concluded is spread amongstapproved counterparties. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed andapproved by the Corporation annually.
Ongoing credit evaluation is performed on the financial condition of the accounts receivable and,where appropriate, credit guarantee insurance cover is purchased.
The Corporation’s concentration of credit risk of 95% and 86% in total accounts receivable as ofDecember 31, 2017 and 2016, respectively, was related to the Corporation’s five largest customers.
Liquidity risk
The Corporation manages liquidity risk by monitoring and maintaining a level of cash and cashequivalents deemed adequate to finance the Corporation’s operations and mitigate the effects offluctuations in cash flows. In addition, management monitors the utilization of bank loans andensures compliance with loan covenants.
The Corporation relies on bank loans as a significant source of liquidity. As of December 31, 2017and 2016, the Corporation had available unutilized short-term bank loan facilities set out in (c)below.
a) Liquidity and interest risk rate tables for non-derivative financial liabilities
The following tables detail the Corporation’s remaining contractual maturity for itsnon-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables had been drawn upbased on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities from the earliest date on which theCorporation can be required to pay. The tables included both interest and principal cash flows.Specifically, bank loans with a repayment on demand clause were included in the earliest timeband regardless of the probability of the banks choosing to exercise their rights. The maturitydates for other non-derivative financial liabilities were based on the agreed repayment dates.

(2) Overview of the industry:1. Industry status and development
Polarizer refers to an important material of the upstream component for LCD. Each piece ofLCD needs two pieces of Polarizer to work with the LCD to control light and form the picture.
For the time being, among the downstream industries which apply Polarizers, the large-sizeTFT-LCD has been applied extensively due to LCD TV, LCD monitor, notebook and pad.Meanwhile, the size of devices which apply the Polarizer tends to be larger and larger, and thedemand for such consumable electronic products as pad, smart phone, digital camera and onboarddevices, and personal wearable device, expansion and virtual-reality monitor still drive the demandfor Polarizer in the market.
For the time being, there is difficulty in entering into the polarizer industry. Technically, as the10.5th-generation LCD plant has been developed, the difficulty to enter into the polarizermanufacturers’ production technology will increase relatively, and the R&D expenditure will beexpanded constantly. As a result, it is difficult for newcomers in the industry to achieve similaroutput and production scale. Meanwhile, the key raw materials of the polarizer industry are stillmonopolized by a few Japanese manufacturers. The newcomers shall establish stable raw materialssupply sources and then may have the chance to achieve stable production. Generally speaking, apolarizer is still an important component for LCD for the time being and there is no otheralternative for it. Besides, the threshold for launching into the polarizer industry is strict and theindustrial structure is unlikely to change substantially in the near future. Following the growth ofthe LCD industry scale, the polarizer industry’s growth is still as expected .
In 2017, the new LCD production capacities developed continuously in Mainland Chinaindeed created huge market opportunities for polarizer manufacturers.
According to the data published by Displaybank, the global demand for polarizer was about463 million square meters in 2016, including 114 million square meters in the territories ofMainland China, i.e. 24.6%, while the GAGR was 39%, higher than the global GAGR, 8%. TheCompany took the chance to arrange its layout, and invested in the establishment of the full-processpolarizer plant for the front-end engineering in Kunshan in 2014. So far, the plant is still underconstruction. After the plant is completed in 2017, the Company’s production capacity of polarizeris expected to increase, and the Company will work hard to develop and seek its market share ofpolarizer in Mainland China.

PVA films are primarily supplied by Kuraray (Kuraray Trading Co., Ltd.)(hereinafter referred to as “Kuraray”) and The Nippon Synthetic Chemical Industry Co.,Ltd.(hereinafter referred to as “Nippon Synthetic Chemical”). The primary coating treatment filmmanufacturers are Dai Nippon Printing Co., Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “DNP”’) and TOPPAN.Further, PET and compensation film suppliers are primarily Japan-based leading manufacturers.Apparently, the main raw materials of polarizer are still controlled by Japan-based manufacturersand, therefore, subject to the upstream suppliers, the polarizer manufacturers’ negotiation for priceis subject to some restrictions when they wish to purchase the materials. Recently, the MainlandChina manufacturers also worked hard to arrange their layout. The types of applied technologiesand products are still under development.
Since then, the Company will continue to strengthen the layout for cooperation with upstreammaterials suppliers and work with downstream customers for product development. Generallyspeaking, the new LCD size and new product output increase constantly. Therefore, the demand forpolarizers is expected to increase year by year.

The Company maintained its stable output of the production base of Tainan Plant, proceededwith de-bottleneck, and enhanced its production capacity and export in 2017. Meanwhile, it will bein line with the exchange of the upstream raw material suppliers’ next generation film materials withrespect to the application of polarizer for TV, research and develop new materials to replace TACfilm materials, and work with the in-house LCD manufacturer to upgrade TV polarizer output andproduction capacity utilization rate via a new type of production process.
With regard to the polarizers for mobile devices, ultra-thin polarizers, multi-functionalpolarizers and polarizers for specific fields (such as vehicle market...etc.) will continue to be jointlydeveloped with the main sales clients. In addition, new customers will be developed continuouslywhile maintaining the flexible production adjustment and planning in order to achieve the businessdemands of customers and to ensure the maximum flexibility in the production and sales of theCompany as well as the reasonable level of inventory.
4. Niches in competition(1). R&D personnel’s sound and professional experience
The dyeing and extension of PVA film in the production process of polarizer and fitness of PVAand TAC are critical to the entire production efficiency and quality level of the products. TheCompany’s related staff have accumulated professional expertise in the production process anddesign of mass production equipment, and have caught up with the advanced manufacturers’

technical level. By participating in the front-end design development of equipment and making thedetailed modification independently, they achieved the production process required by the Companyand upgraded the production efficiency and quality. Meanwhile, the Company’s equipment designadhered to conservative and stable strategies and would go through careful evaluation. All of thedesigns would take the mass production possibility into consideration and be judged based onproduction effects.
Meanwhile, the Company owns the excellent R&D team dedicated to providing samples to becertified by customers by improving the production process and technology on an on-going basisand per the customers’ need for new product development, so as to improve the characteristics ofproducts, upgrade the product quality, and enhance the enterprise’s competitiveness.
(2). Ability to develop product and equipment
A polarizer is an important component of LCD. Function and specifications of the polarizerwill be critical to the performance and quality of polarizer. Therefore, at the beginning when theproduct and equipment are designed, polarizer manufacturers must clearly verify the LCDmanufacturers’ requirements and then verify the optimum materials and design. Besides, since somegaps in professionalism and information exists between the LCD manufacturers and raw materialssuppliers, which need to be integrated rapidly, the polarizer manufacturers shall play the roleresponsible for communication and integration. The Company has fair cooperative relationship withthe upstream and downstream dealers, and is very experienced in putting products into massproduction rapidly, able to integrate the requirements among raw materials suppliers, polarizermanufacturers and LCD manufacturers and correspondent supply capacity to achieve the commonagreement on reciprocal cooperation and thus boost the development plans for new products jointly.Through the vertical integration, the Company may shorten the development timeframe and cost ofdownstream LCD manufacturers sharply and also the time to market of the LCD manufacturers’products, and significantly strengthen the competitiveness of customers’ products to achieve theeffect of mutual benefit.
(3). Already launch into potential markets
The Company’s production technology and pricing competitiveness with respect to themainstream LCD models can afford to compete with the international leading manufacturers. TheCompany works with LCD manufactures and thus may supply goods nearby. The Mainland Chinagovernment strongly cultivates the local LCD industry and boosts locally-made LCD and, therefore,the local LCD manufacturers’ production capacity is upgraded greatly. As a result, the supply ofpolarizer cannot meet the demand thereof. The Company’s plant in Kunshan is expected to start themass production from May 2017. Then, the market share of the Company’s LCD plant invested byMainland China is expected to increased.
The Company strengthens the quality of its own products and actively controls customers’development orientation and needs, and develops the products which meet the market trend percustomers’ requirement to further develop the cooperation with customers and strive for repeat order.Expecting that the demand for polarizer is increasing in the Mainland China market, the Companyworks hard to develop local customers. Because the Company keeps improving its product qualityand production process, its polarizer is recognized by the leading LCD manufacturers in MainlandChina and starts to accept order therefor.
Meanwhile, expecting that the demand for onboard audiovisual equipment is increasing in
Mainland China, the Company works hard to launch into the onboard LCD market in MainlandChina to strive for repeat order.
(4). Cost Competitiveness
The Company’s production technology philosophy highlights the pursuit of competitivenessin cost in a reasonable manner. Therefore, the Company keeps taking corrective plans to improvethe production management indicators, such as yield rate, loss, cutting utilization rate and first pass
-61-
===================================================
66.hocr: 
yield (FPY), as well as human resource organization, in order to keep cutting the production cost.The Company is able to develop testing machines on its own to enhance the automated operationsand reduce labor costs and also dedicated to shortening the development time and urge theproduction scale to become stable as soon as possible to upgrade the entire competitiveness.Therefore, the Company has the specific competitiveness in product cost, compared with the othersin the same trade. Meanwhile, the Company maintains stable and reliable cooperative relationshipwith downstream customers and may control any changes of the order placed by the downstreamcustomers and control the inventory of supplies effectively. The Company also reduces idlematerials as possible it could, but no shutdown resulting from failure to prepare materials timely orshortfall of material or concern about waste derived from expiration of the materials would occur;therefore, the Company’s strength in cost of the plagiarizer products is enhanced.
5. Advantage and disadvantage of long term development and reaction strategy¢ Advantage:
(1). LCD market application remains extensive and prevailing
LCD is applied to LCD TV and small-size and mid-size consumable mobile devices, such asmobile phones, smart phones, digital cameras and monitors. The application is extensive andprevailing in the market, so that the entire consumer market demand for LCD is considered high.Particularly, electronic products keep evolving. New technology is used to arousing a new wave ofneeds. In terms of the current market trend, application of LED back-light module and 3D imagewill upgrade the demand for LCD TV or result in replacement of TV with new generation.Large-size TVs, small-size and mid-size mobile devices and pads will become the mainstreamproducts in the future. Meanwhile, consumable electronic products drive growth of consumers’demand drastically upon the economic recovery. Such related applications help increase the demandfor LCD continuously and thereby drive the growth of business scale for such industry as upstreamLCD components including polarizer indirectly.
(2). Mainland China invests in the LCD industry actively and, therefore, the demand for upstreamcomponents has increased sharply.
According to the new LCD productivity released by Mainland China for the following threeyears until 2018, the polarizer manufacturers will have tremendous market opportunities therefor.The production capacity of LCD in the territories of Mainland China is growing rapidly and therebydrives the increasing demand for related upstream components. As one of the critical components,the demand for polarizer is also increasing significantly. In the following three years, newproduction capacity of LCD will be released and, therefore, the demand for polarizer will increaseagain. Upon completion of the Company’s plant in Kunshan, the Company’s market share in thepolarizer market will be upgraded accordingly.
Meanwhile, expecting that the demand for onboard audiovisual equipment is increasing inMainland China, the Company works hard to launch into the onboard LCD market in MainlandChina to strive for repeat order.
(3). It is difficult for new competitors to launch into the market, as the product certification takes along time.
Polarizer is a critical component of LCDs. In order to prevent upstream products fromnon-conformance with the existing standard specifications, LCD manufacturers will certify andcontrol production lines of polarizer. As it takes a long time to certify the products and LCDmanufacturers intend to maintain their product quality, generally they are reluctant to try thematerials provided by new suppliers. For the time being, the domestic LCD market is monopolizedby certain manufacturers. The leading LCD suppliers who supply goods steadily possess theadvantages. As a result, new polarizer manufacturers will encounter certain difficulties.
s<Disadvantage and Reaction Strategy
-62-
===================================================
67.hocr: 

Disadvantages
Reaction Strategy

[The production stillfrelies on imported rawmaterials.
[The speed of production capacity of the polarizer industry each year is highly correlated to the speed ofmaterials supply. The Japan-based raw materials suppliers who control the polarizer TAC, PET and COPlpermanently are FUJIFILM and Konica Minolta, Toyobo and Zeon.
[The Company applies bulk buying and works hard to seek reasonable price reduction from suppliers.IMeanwhile, it maintains long-term and fair relationship with the main suppliers. Meanwhile, in order toIprevent natural calamities in Japan from affecting the global economic market and thereby causing the rawmaterials supply sources to suffer trouble, the Company increases the 2nd priority supply source of the rawmaterials and also looks for alternative raw materials in other territories to spread the risk over excessivelconsolidation of purchasing operations.
For the raw materials TAC, PET and COP existing in a monopolized market, the Company also continues tolobserve the other domestic TAC film manufacturers launching into the industry and testing their productquality, in the hope of changing the upstream raw materials suppliers’ competitive structure.
IMeanwhile, the Company actively strengthens control and evaluation of the safe inventory and establisheslemergency response organization and framework plan, so that the Company may take effective actions torespond to any incidents immediately to mitigate the Company’s risks and loss as much as it possibly can andlensure mitigation of the risk over shortfall of materials.


[[n line withdownstreamcustomers’ demand for|[price reduction of[polarizers.
In order to meet the downstream LCD manufacturers’ large demand and request for stable gross profit, theICompany will cut costs and upgrade the competitiveness of products by adjusting product portfolio, keepinglupgrading the yield rate of production lines and maximizing the available rate of production capacity. To be in|line with the future demand for consumable electronics, the Company works hard to develop the market ofmid-size and small-size LCD customers and applies compound cutting in the hope of upgrading thelutilization rate of raw materials to create extra profits, and also deals with downstream customers’ request forlprice reduction by keeping developing new products.

[The drastic fluctuationfin the foreignlexchange rate for JPYlaffects the Company’scost of materials.

In order to evade risks over fluctuation in foreign exchange rate, financially, the Company underwritesfforward exchange contracts to hedge the effects caused by drastic fluctuations in foreign exchange rate, andalso plans to introduce domestic suppliers, in the hope of increasing the proportion of domestic purchasingloperations, shortening purchasing time and reducing the dependence on Japan-based manufacturers tomitigate the foreign exchange rate risk by hedging instruments.

===================================================
82.hocr: 
(1) Debt ratio= Total Liabilities / Total Assets
(2) Long-term funds to property, plant and equipment = (Total equity + Non-current liabilities ) / Property, plant and equipment, net
2. Liquidity analysis
(1) Current ratio = Current assets / Current liability
(2) Quick ratio = (Current Assets - Inventories - Prepaid expenses) / Current liability
(3) Times interest earned = Profit Before Credit for Income Tax / Current interest expense
3. Operating performance analysis
(1) Average collection turnover(Including Accounts Receivable and Notes Receivable from operation) = Sales / Average trade receivables
(2) Days to collect accounts receivable = 365 / Average collection turnover
(3) Average inventory turnover = Cost of goods sold / Average inventories
(4) Average payment turnover (Including Accounts Payable and Notes Payable from operation) = operating costs / Average tradepayables
(5) Average days to sell inventory = 365 / Average inventory turnover
(6) Property, plant and equipment turnover rate = Net sales / average property, plant and equipment, net
(7) Total assets turnover = Sales / Average total assets
4. Return on investment analysis
(1) Rate of return on assets = [Profit + Interest expense X (1 - Tax rate)] / Average assets
(2) Rate of return on equity = Profit / Average total Equity
(3) Profit to sales = Profit / Sales
(4) Earnings per share = (Equity attributable to owners of parent - Dividend-preferred stock ) / Weighted average outstanding shares(Note 4)
5. Cash flow
(1) Cash flow ratio = Net cash provided by operating activities / Current liability
(2) Cash flow adequacy ratio = 5-year net cash provided by operating activities / 5-year (Capital expense + Increase in inventories + Cashdividend)
(3) Cash flow reinvestment ratio = (Net cash provided by operating activities - Cash dividend) - (Property, plant and equipment, net +Long-term investments + Other non-current assets + Operating Capital) (Note 5)
6. Leverage
(1) Operating Leverage = (Net operating revenue — Variable cost and expense) / Operating income (Note 6)
(2) Financial leverage = Operating income / (Operating income — Interest expenses)
Note 4: Please note the following when measuring based on said calculation of EPS:
1. Based on the number of weighted average common shares, instead of the number of shares already issued at the end of year.
2. Inthe event of cash capital increase or exchange of treasury stock, please take the outstanding period into consideration whencalculating the weighted average outstanding shares.
3. Inthe event of recapitalization of earnings or capital surplus, the calculation of annual and semi-annual EPS in the past shall beadjusted retroactively subject to the capital increase ratio, without taking the issuance period for the capital increase intoconsideration.
4. If the preferred stock refers to non-convertible accumulated preferred stock, the current stock dividend (whether allocated or not) shallbe deducted from the net income after tax, or the net loss after tax should be increased. If the preferred stock refers tonon-accumulated preferred stock, the preferred stock dividend shall be deducted from the net income after tax, if any, provided that ifthe Company suffers loss, it is not necessary to make the adjustment.
Note 5: Please note the following when measuring under cash flow analysis:
1. The net cash flow from operating activities means the net cash inflow from operating activities in the statement of cash flow.
2. The capital expenditure means the cash outflow from the capital investment each year.
3. The increase in inventory will be included only when the balance at ending is more than the balance at beginning. If the inventorydecreases at the end of year, it should be calculated as 0.
4. The cash dividends includes the cash dividend on common stock and preferred stock.
5. The gross of property, plant and equipment means the total property, plant and equipment before deduction of accumulateddepreciation.
Note 6: The issuer shall categorize various operating costs and expenses into fixed and floating ones by nature. If any estimation or
subjective judgment is involved, please note the reasonableness and consistency thereof.

. Continue expanding customer base in Mainland China: The Chinese government continues to regard the
LCD industry as a key supporting industry. According to IHS data, as of the end of year 2017, MainlandChina has 9 high-generation 8.5 (8.6) LCD plants, and has established another one generation 8.5 plantand one generation 10.5 plant of which the production capacity is gradually increasing. It is estimatedthat the production capacity will have exceeded that of Korea in 2018. Along with the new lines to beinvested in the future, the number of high-generation plants will reach 19, making China the world’slargest LCD supply area and accounting for over 50% of the World’s production capacity.
Productivity of the local polarizer plants in Mainland China, Shenzhen Sheng wave OptoelectronicTechnology Co., Ltd. and SUNNYPOL OPTOELECTRONICE CO., LTD, still cannot afford to meet thedemand for polarizers in Mainland China. The major gap in the demand still depends on the supply fromthe leading polarizer manufacturers in Japan and Korea. The Mainland Chinese government hopes thatthe LCD supply chain may be localized step by step. The joint venture invested by the Company andHangzhou Jinjiang Group set up the front-end production line of Chimei Materials in Kunshan, whichhas entered into mass production, met the localized supply chain criteria, and may catch the trend of thehigh-speed growth of LCD in Mainland China.
. Develop the existing major customers: The market share of polarizer supplied by the Company to the
major customers for their TV products is still low. Therefore, there is still the room for the Company todevelop the market. Besides, as the major customers will bring new production capacity in 2017 and thedemand for polarizer is expected to increase, the Company is expected to grow continuously in Taiwanmarket.
. Reduction in raw material cost: Chimei Materials in Kunshan is expected to enter into mass production
in 2017Q2. Then, as the procurement quantity of raw materials and supplies increase accordingly, theCompany’s ability to procure and negotiate the price for the products may be enhanced. In addition to theJapanese suppliers, the Company will accelerate introducing raw materials sourced from the suppliersother than Japanese suppliers, and locally-made raw materials in order to help reduce the raw materialcost.
. Continue to upgrade production quality: Considering that the polarizer industry is gradually becoming
mature, the standard product price competition is getting more and more intensive. In order to increasethe added value of product, the Company will focus its layout on the high-end market in the future.Because of the higher technology threshold of the market, the market is almost monopolized byJapan-based manufacturers. The added value of the product is higher than that of the standard product.Following the Company’s increasing penetration rate in the market, the profit to be earned by the productmay be increased step by step.
. The cooperation project with Nitto Denko Corporation: Subsidiary Chimei Materials Technology Corp.
(Kunshan) cooperated with Nitto Denko Corporation, the World’s leading polarizer firm, in 2017. NittoDenko Corporation established the world’s largest 2.5-meters-wide production line via technicalauthorization to accompany the high-generation production lines to be constructed in the future. Throughthe cooperation, it will be beneficial to Chimei Materials Technology Corp. (Kunshan) in continuouslyproducing low-cost and high-quality products.

Analysis of changes in cash flow:






1. Operating activities: Given the net loss before tax in 2017, the increase in account receivables, inventory, prepayment and othercurrent assets resulted in the increase in net cash outflow from operating activities in 2017 compared with 2016.
2. Investing activities: The Company’s pre-payment for civil engineering work and equipment expenditure in Kunshan resulted in theincrease in cash outflow. Thus, there was a decrease in net cash outflow from investing activities in 2017.
3. Financing activities: In order to upgrade financial flexibility in 2016, the Company drew down the bank loan and initiated thesyndicated loan project for Kunshan Plant, therefore resulting in the increase in financing. Meanwhile, the capital invested by theminor interest of Kuanshan Plant, NT$ 2.23 billion, resulted in a decrease in net cash inflow from financing activities in 2017.

Analysis of changes in cash flow in the coming year:
A. Operating activities: Currently, the price of polarizer is stable, but the price cutting pressure of normal products is large. Thus,the Company will focus more on existing customers and develop high-quality products. At the same time, it will also continueexpanding to mid- and small-size preferred customers and move on to differentiation and thinner products. It will maintain goodrelationship with suppliers and strives for stable and lower-cost material supply. The equipment and production technology willalso be improved.
Investing activities: The Company’s expenditure include the routine replacement of spare parts of the equipment, maintenanceof the equipment and purchase of machine & equipment, which totaled NT$ 75 million. Meanwhile, Chimei Materials inKunshan needs about NT$ 7.73 billion in plant expanding. The total fund required was about NT$ 7.848 billion.
Financing activities: Chimei Materials in Kunshan expects to issue shares by cash for NT$ 146 million in 2018Q2, and issueshares by cash for RMB800 million and borrow from the bank in 2018Q3, in order to support the funds needed in the secondproduction line.

4. Effects of any major capital expenditures on financial operations during the most recent year:(1) Utilization of major capital expenditures and source of funding:
1. The major capital expenditure in the most recent year (2018) (for procurement of machines andequipment, and routine maintenance of equipment and plant) totaled NT$ 3.3 billion.
2. The important capital expenditure in 2018 is expected to be mainly the NT$ 100 million ofprocurement and upgrading of equipment in Taiwan. The capital expenditure of ChimeiMaterials Technology Corp. (Kunshan) in expanding the second production line and technicalauthorization fees totaled about NT$ 3.2 billion, with the main funding source being self-ownedfund, share issuance and bank loans.

(3) Investment plans for the coming year:
Chimei Materials Technology Corp. (Kunshan) entered into mass production formally in2017Q2, and its capital expenditure in 2018 is expected to be NT$ 7.8 billion which is mainlyfor supporting the construction of the 2.5-meters super-wide front-end production line and thetechnical authorization fees of the Kunshan plant. It is expected to increase the Kunshan plant’spolarizer production volume after entering into production, and provide customers withhigh-quality and low-cost polarizers.
6. For risk items, the Company shall analyze and assess the following matters in the most recentyear and up to the date of publication of the annual report:(1) The effect of interest, foreign exchange rate fluctuation and inflation rate on the Company'sprofits and losses, and measures to be taken in response in the future:1. Interest rate:
The Company suffered continuous losses in 2016 and 2017. The main funding source wassales revenue and short-term bank loans. In the future, as the Company turns out of the red, it isexpected to gradually prepay the bank loans and lower bank financing amount. Assume that theborrowing amount balance for the whole year is NT$ 2 billion, then the interest will increase byNT$ 2,500,000 as the interest rate increase by 12.5 basis points. The resulting interest expensewill not cause effect on the Company’s income and losses.
The Company’s investee, Chimei Materials Technology Corp. (Kunshan), signed thesyndicated loan agreement with the syndicated lending banks in August 2016. For example,assuming that the annual balance of the bank loan borrowed by Chimei Materials TechnologyCorp. (Kunshan) is US$124 million (at the interest rate 4%) and that the loan is RMB700million, the interest will increase by US$155 thousand as the interest rate increase by 12.5 basispoints. Considering the Company’s 49% shareholding, the increase in interest shall have noeffect to the Company’s income and losses.
2. Foreign exchange rate:
The Company delegates dedicated personnel in its financial department to collect theinformation about foreign exchange rate anytime, and also keeps in touch with its correspondentbanks to verify the bank’s vision toward the trend of foreign exchange rate and the globaleconomic information, in order to help the Company judge the future trend of foreign exchangerates. Meanwhile, the Company will underwrite forward foreign exchange contracts in a timelymanner to reduce the effect of foreign exchange risk on the Company’s income and losses.
3. Inflation:In the future, the Company will continue to maintain close and fair interaction with
-87-

===================================================
92.hocr: 
suppliers and customers, and expand its productivity to achieve the economies of scale effect,and continue to improve the production process to reduce the production cost, in the hope ofmitigating the effect of inflation on the Company’s income.
(2) The Company's policy regarding high-risk investments, highly leveraged investments, loans toother parties, endorsements and guarantees, derivatives transactions, the main reasons for theprofits/losses generated thereby, and the plan for improving re-investment profitability:
1. For the most recent year and up to the date of publication of the prospectus (May 5, 2018),the Company has never engaged in high-risk investment, highly leveraged investment orloaning to others.
2. Statement of loans to others and endorsements/guarantees: Please refer to p.102~p.103.
3. The Company’s derivative trading policy is stated as follows:
The Company engages in derivatives trading primarily for hedging against the foreigncurrency net position. In the future, the Company will continue to observe the trend of foreigncurrency exchange rate and engage in derivatives trading in a timely manner to reduce theforeign exchange risk of the Company’s foreign currency net position.
(3) Research and development (R&D) plans to be carried out in the future and the expected R&Dexpenditures:Future R&D plans:
The Company is a professional optimum film manufacturer. Its mid-term and short-termR&D plans will focus on polarizer. The mid- and long-term R&D plan will extend to filmmaterials and multiple firm materials, in order to keep enriching the completeness of productsand strengthening the Company’s competitiveness.
2. Further expenditures expected for research and development:
The Company schedules to invest NT$ 529,015 thousand of R&D expenditure in 2018,which accounts for 3% of the Company’s revenue.
3. There will be new technology of strategic importance in the future:
a. It is expected that various LCD manufacturers will start the mass production of 8K4K LCDsuccessively in the latter half of 2017 to 2018. However, given the upgraded 8K4Kresolution and the drastic declination of perture ratio, the LCD power consumption isexpected to be upgraded sharply. To deal with such situation, the Company and itssubsidiary, Chimei Visual Technology Corp., have worked with each other permanently. Inthe future, the OMNI-FILM developed by Chimei Visual Technology Corp. will be appliedto the external layer of the polarizer to meet the needs for 8K4K low-power consumptionpolarizer and resolve the energy consumption issue raised by customers.
b. With the existing equipment and technology power, the Company actively engages indeveloping new multiple film material solution for applying on LCDs, by which to developnew products other than polarizers!
(4) The effect of important changes of policies and legal environments at home and abroad on theCompany's financial operation, and the measures to be taken in response:The Company is used to complying with the related domestic and foreign laws and regulations,and keeps watching any policies and laws which might affect the Company’s operations toensure the Company’s normal operations. If necessary, the Company will consult with suchprofessional entities as attorneys-at-law and CPA firms, or entrust them to evaluate, suggest andplan the counter-measures to achieve compliance with laws and reduce the adverse effect to theCompany’s financial business.
(5) Effect of technology development and industrial change on the Company's financial operationsand measures to be taken in response:The Company is used to valuing developments in science and technology and industrial change.The Company is still not satisfied with its current achievements, but works hard to seekinsightful electronic chemical products and continues to invest funds in R&D of new product

lines, in the hope of achieving the Company’s sustainable development.
(6) Effects of corporate image change on the Company's crisis management, and measures to betaken in response:Since the Company was incorporated, it has upheld the ethical management and sustainabledevelopment as its objective, and strictly complied with related laws and internal controlrequirements, and also adjusted related operations in a timely manner to deal with the changes.
(7) Expected benefits and possible risks associated with any merger and acquisitions, and responsemeasures to be taken: The Company has no plan for merger and acquisition so far.
(8) Expected benefit and possible risk associated with plant expansion, and measures to be taken inresponse:
In order to deal with China LCD manufacturers’ demand for Polarizer and increase theCompany’s market share of Polarizer in the market of Mainland China and other countries inthe world, the Company invested in Chimei Materials in Kunshan, which has started to buildthe first production line. It started its mass production in 2017Q2.
As LCD quickly started production, there will be large needs for polarizers. Thus, inaddition to the existing Chimei Materials in Kunshan which has invested in the 1.5Mproduction line, the Company plans to cooperate with Nitto Denko Corporation, one of theworld’s leading polarizer manufacturers. Nitto Denko Corporation will authorize the productiontechnology of 2.5M wide line and provide necessary technical guidance. Chimei Materials inKunshan will invest a 2.5M wide polarizer production line.
As the production capacity in Mainland China grows successively, the market demand forpolarizer is expected to rapidly grow over 20,000,000 meter square per month. Specifically, thecurrent polarizer supply is still limited in China, and most firms rely on imports. Thus, there isan eager demand for nationalization. There is also tariff for imported polarizers in China. Theinvestment of 2.5M production line by Chimei Materials in Kunshan will follow thefast-growing demand for polarizer in China. The Company also has the advantage of free tarifffor its products. Furthermore, with the advanced technology provided by Nitto DenkoCorporation, the competitiveness of Chimei Materials in Kunshan will be strengthened inChina market.
The Company and its suppliers are used to negotiating for contracts and transaction priceson a quarterly basis. Due to the fact that the upstream raw materials are manufactured byJapan-based or Korea-based leading manufacturers, the room saved for the Company’snegotiation for price about procurement of materials is limited. After the first production lineinstalled in Kunshan plant starts to engage in mass production and achieves its productivity, theCompany plans to negotiate with the upstream suppliers for price by claiming to lower thepurchase cost by volume purchase to strengthen the Company’s competitiveness.
The above-mentioned investment projects have been evaluated by the Company throughstrict procedure and approved by the Investment Committee, MOEA. The Company hasinvested its own fund in 2014 for constructing the first line, and plans to invest in anothersecond line with its own funds. Therefore, no risk should be incurred to the Company’soperation.
(9) Risks associated with purchasing or sales consolidation, and measures to be taken in response:Consolidation of purchasing operations: The upstream raw materials supply refers to amonopolized market, which is held as the industrial characteristic. The Company is used tokeeping fair relationships with its suppliers and never stops communicating with them. TheCompany establishes the safety control over inventory and increases the second source ofsupply to seek the possibility for replacement of the suppliers with local manufacturers.
-89 -
===================================================
94.hocr: 
Consolidation of sales operations: The downstream customers are concentrated in InnoluxCorporation (hereinafter referred to as “Innolux”) and its affiliates, primarily as a result of theindustrial characteristics. Notwithstanding, in addition to said customer, the Company’scustomers also include Chunghwa Picture Tube, Ltd. (hereinafter referred to as “ChunghwaPicture”) and its affiliates and HannStar® Display Corporation (“HannStar”) and othercustomers. Under the increasing production capacity of the Line 1 in Kunshan Plant and theadvantage of nationalization, the sales of China LCD manufacturers gradually increase. It isexpected that the sales of China LCD will continue increasing and the customers will bediversified after the second line started production.
(10) Effect upon and risk to the Company in the event a major quantity of shares held by a director(including independent director), or a major shareholder with more than 10% shareholding hasbeen transferred or changed hands, and measures to be taken in response:
1. The major shareholder, Chimei Corporation, had shareholdings of 14.88% in 2017 (untilDecember 31, 2017). Notwithstanding, until April 24, 2018 (date of suspension of stocktransfer), its shareholdings has declined to 4.83%.
2. Chimei Corporation is the Company’s major shareholder. It disposed of equity primarily forenriching its operating funds. Upon evaluation, its disposition of equity should be consideredas having no direct effect to the Company’s finance and business.
