Natural Gas Supply Outlook
Despite its formidable gas reserves and its geographical location in a part of the world with vast reserves, itis likely that Mexico, with its lack of infrastructure for natural gas transponation and its relatively low levels ofextraction,will ﬁnd it difﬁcult to meet the growing internal demand, and therefore, will continue to be dependent on natural gasimpotts. According to the Ministry ofEnergy’s Natural Gas and LP Gas Prospect for 2015-2029, these imports helpedmeet about 38% 0f the country’s demand in 2015, As the result of the increased demand for natural gas, the NationalPipeline System (which prior to the recent energy reforms was controlled by Pemex TRI) has proved limited in itscapacity, posing a major threat of intenuption 0f the supply of natural gas to consumers.
Competition Outlook
In general terms, the Mexican energy industry is highly concentrated in a few key players that account for asigniﬁcant portion ofeach market segments In the natural gas pipeline market, the four largest companies control almost90% 0f the market. CENAGAS controls the largest share, representing 35% 0f the market, followed by the Company,with 33% (based on design capacity)‘ Likewise, the natural gas distribution market is concentrated in only a fewcompanies: Gas Natural Fenosa and Engie control almost 80% 0f the total market, altogether representing (in terms ofthe number of customers) 62% and 19%, respectively. In the private energy generation market, the two main companies,Iberdola and Gas Natural Fenosa, collectively control 61% of the total market (in terms ofdesign capacity)
The CompetitionThe Gas SegmentThe Gas Pipeline Business
While nearly all of the natural gas transportation capacity is contracted under ﬁrm, long—term capacityagreements, in the event that the Company participates in calls for bids for new natural gas projects, in order to attractcustomers the Company may ﬁnd itselfhaving to compete with other energy infrastructure service providers with largeamounts of capital, such as TransCanada, Kinder Morgan, Elecnot, Engie, Fermaca, Grupo Carso and Enagés. Inaddition, the Company may face competition from public or state-operated companies, their subsidiaries and afﬁliates,
The LPG supply market is highly competitive. At present, new pipelines are being built to meet the demandfor LPG in each ofthe markets covered by the pipelines. The Company’s pipelines compete mainly with those of othercompanies that transport, store and distribute natural gas and LPG. Some of these competitors could expand and buildnew systems, thus creating additional competition to the services the Company renders to its customers.
The LNG Buxiness
At present, the LNG Terminal faces no competition since its full capacity is consigned to long-term contractsthat generate income for the Company whether or not the customers deliver shipments of LNG. In the event that theCompany should have available storage capacity at the LNG Terminal, the Company will have to compete in order toattract customers wishing to supply gas in northern Mexico and in the United States, Presently, the only otherregasiﬁcation terminals on the west coast of North and South America are Manzanillo LNG (owned by KOGAS, Mitsuiand Samsung), in the state of Colima; LNG Mejillones (owned by Engie and Codelco) in Chile, and LNG Quintero(property of BG Group, ENAP, Endesa Chile and Metrogas), also based in Chile These terminals serve markets inwhich the Company does not compete
The Natural Gas Distribution BusinessThe key competitors to the distribution business of the Company are the LP gas distributors that furnish that
product directly to their customers 7generally in trucksi for its storage on their own property. While the cost of naturalgas that the distribution business passes on to the Clients is based on its price in the international market, the price of

===================================================
101.hocr: 
the LP gas with which the Company competes has recently been deeontrolled to adapt to the market price. The naturalgas that the distribution business offers competes with LP gas not only in terms of price bus also in terms of safety,convenience and environmental impact. Unlike LP gas, natural gas is lighter than air and, therefore, can disperse moreeasily, reducing the risk ofexplosion, In addition, since the Company furnishes an uninterrupted supply ofnatural gasto customers when they require it, and unlike LP gas, the use of natural gas does not require customers to store it, theCompany feels that the customers View its product as more convenient than LP gas. Finally, since natural gas burnsmore cleanly than LP gas and does not discharge sulﬁir oxides 0r particles, the Company feels that customers also Viewits product as a more environmentally friendly altemative to LP gas. Despite these advantages, many potential customerscontinue using LP gas due to the cost involved in outﬁtting their homes or businesses to use natural gas.
Apart from the above, since the twelve-year exclusivity period for the distribution territories expired in 201 1,the Company could face competition from other natural gas distributors in those territoriesiAs the result of the expirationof the exclusivity period, the law now allows other companies to build gas natural gas distribution systems and tocompete with the Company to attract customers in each of the distribution territories. This is despite the fact that theEnergy Regulatory Commission has yet to issue clear guidelines concerning this possible competitions As other naturalgas distributors overcome these barriers, invade the distribution territories, and expand or build distribution systemsin them, they will create additional competition for the natural gas distribution activity. The customers are also legallypermitted to establish free access transportation systems, thereby building and operating their own natural gas systemsto suit their requirements. As other distribution systems are established in the distribution territories, the Company, too,will have to compete with them to supply the Company’s clientele,
The Company’s ability to compete in the natural gas distribution market is also subject to limitations due tothe regulation of this activity. For example, in order to obtain a favorable opinion from the Mexican Antitrust Commission(COFFEE) for the permits the Company required for the operation of the Rosarito pipelines system, the Companyagreed to sell the ECOGAS Mexicali distribution system, The Company assumed this obligation in 2000 and has triedin good faith to meet this requirement but has yet to ﬁnd a buyer for these assets, See “Risk Factors 7 Risks Relatingto The Company’s business and Industry— The Company operates in a highly regulated environment, and the proﬁtabi litydepends on the ability of the Company to timely and efﬁciently comply with a number of laws and regulations on atimely and efﬁcient basis.”
The Electric Energy Segment
The laws and regulations applicable to electric energy generation in Mexico limited private industry participationto certain types of activities: independent electric energy production, exportation, small production and generation ofself-supplied energy for their own use. However, with the energy reform and the August 2014 publication of the ElectricEnergy Industry Law, private industry generation of electric energy, while subject to the issuance of a permit, is nolonger limited and may be sold to the wholesale markets. See the section “Legal Framework and Taxation? CENACEcurrently holds annual calls for the award of long-term electricity supply contracts with CFE, where the Companycompetes with globally recognized energy generators such as Enel, Engie, Iberdrola, Gas Natural Fenosa, Mitsui andEDF, among others.
During 2016, IEnova participated in these bidding processes and was awarded two solar projects during the SecondLong Term Auction: Tepezala Solar and Rumorosa Solar with capacities of 100 MWAC and 41 MWAC, respectively,which are expected to start operations in 2019. In 2017, the Company executed a 20-year dollardenominated electricsupply agreement with DeAcero to provide it with energy, clean energy cettiﬂcates and capacity generated by the 110MWAC Pima Solar project to be developed, constructed and operated by the Company in Caborca, Sonora‘ The companyexpects that the Pima Solar project will start commercial operations in the fourth quarter of 201 8 and have an estimatedinvestment of approximately USD$ 115 million.
Regarding the operation of Termoeléctrica de Mexicali, it sells its energy in the state of Califomia’s wholesalemarket, competing daily with other generating companies that supply energy in the same market
With regard to the Energia Sierra Juarez wind power generation facility, all the electric energy generated by theﬁrst phase of this project is sold to one of the Company’s afﬁliates in the United States under a long-term supply

contract. See the section “—Business segments 7 Electric Energy Segments 7 generation of electric energy using wind:Energia Sierra Juarez —Key contracts — Power Purchase Agreements.” In order to attract customers in the United States,the Company competes mainly with other energy producing plants and with the spot market in general. In terms of thesale of electric energy to customers in the United States, the electric energy that the Company sells and markets throughits afﬁliates is in direct competition with other generating and marketing companies who serve the markets in the regionswhere the Company operates. These competitors may include government owned energy-produeing companies, localdealers with their own generating capacity and other private companies dedicated to electric energy generation andmarketing. In view of the fact that Sempra Energy, the holding company, also participates in the electric energy generationsegment through afﬁliates of the Company in the United States, the Company could also compete with these afﬁliates,The key elements comprising competition are price, availability, terms of service, ﬂexibility and reliability. The supplyand demand for electric energy are affected by the performance of the economy in general, conservation measures,legislation, environmental regulations, weather conditions and the expansion of generation capacity, among otherfactors‘

pipeline, San Fernando pipeline, Samalayuca pipeline, Ethane pipeline, TDF LPG pipeline, Los Ramones I pipeline, Gloriaa Dios compression station and Guadalajara LPG terminal As a result of the Company’s recent acquisition of the remaining50% interest in Ductos y Energéticos del Norte that we did not previously own, we also now own a 50% interest in the LosRamones Norte pipeline. See “-Recent Developments-Ductos y Energe'ticos del Notte Acquisition,”
The Company’s natural gas pipeline assets have an aggregate design transportation capacity ofover 16,501 MMcfd(171.6 MMThd). The ethane pipeline has a design transportation capacity of approximately 52 MMcfd (0.6 MMThd) in theﬁrst segment, approximately 152 MMcfd(1.8 MMThd) in the second segment, both as ethane gas, and approximately 106,000Bbld (119 MMThd) in the third segment as ethane liquid The Company’s LPG pipeline has a design transportation capacity0f34,000 Bbld (1‘9 MMThd), Upon its completion, the Company’s pipelines business will also include the South ofTexas-Tuxpan pipeline, which will add approximately 800 km of natural gas pipeline infrastructure and a design natural gastransportation capacity of approximately 2.6 Bcfd (27,0 MMThd).
The majority of the Company’s pipelines, compression stations and storage facilities have long-term ﬁxed- capacitycontracts with leading industry players, including Shell, Gazprom, CFE, InterGen, TransCanada and CENAGAS, as assigneeofPemex TRI.
Pipelines Firm Transportation Services Agreements

The Company has entered into long-term ﬁml transportation services agreements with various customers withrespect to all of the Company’s pipelines, which are the key revenue generating contracts for the Company’s pipelinesbusiness. Pursuant to these contracts the Company is obligated to provide to its customers, and the Company’s customersare required to pay the Company for, natural gas transportation service for up to certain maximum daily quantities ofnaturalgas or LPG, as applicable. Each customer pays a monthly fee consisting of a ﬁxed reservation component and a variablecomponent based on the amount of natural gas delivered, plus reimbursement for expenses related to the transportationservices that the Company provides. The ﬁxed reservation component ofthese fees account for the substantial majority ofthe Company’s revenues under these agreements and must be paid by the Company’s customers whether or not they usetheir contracted capacity.
The majority of these agreements have U.S. dollar-denominated ﬁxed rates that are lower than those authorized bythe CRE, The CRE establishes (and periodically adjusts) the maximum rates that we may charge to users that have not agreedupon a lower rate with us. For agreements that reﬂect the maximum rate allowed by the CRE, the fee is adjusted annuallyto account for inﬂation and changes in the US dollar- Mexican peso exchange rate in accordance with the Prices and TariffsDirective (Directiva de Precios y Tarifas) established by the CRE.
Most of the Company’s ﬁrm transportation services agreements also include a ﬁnancial guarantee or letter ofcreditto secure the Company’s customers’ compliance with the terms of the contract. Because the majority of the Company’spipelines systems are open-access, any unused capacity in the Company’s pipeline systems can be sold to existing customersor to any third party pursuant to interruptible transportation agreements While the Company has entered into intermptibletransportation services agreements with some customers, such contracts have historically been immaterial to the Company’sbusiness and results of operations,

The Company deﬁnes long-term capacity contracts as those ﬁrm contracts with a remaining life ofat least eight years.
This reﬂects the percentage of capacity contracted, which depending on the contract, may be expressed in volume or a heating value (such asBTUs). Although the Company sometimes shows design capacity and contracted capacity ﬁgures in both units ofvulume and heating capacityin order to facilitate comparisons of the different gas segment businesses, in view of the slight differences arising when these ﬁgures areconverted, some ofthe ﬁgures shown in this Report may not coincide exactly with the percentage ofcontracted capacity.
The Rosarito Pipeline comprises three segments with different lengths, diameters and transportation capacities, as described below. The ﬁguresshown in this table are the arithmetical sum ofthe length and the design capacities ofeach 0f the three sections comprising this system, ascalculated by the Energy Regulation Commission.
The TGN pipeline includes an expansion that began operation in February 2008.

LN G BusinessOverview
The Company’s LNG business consists oftwo related operations. The ﬁrst of these is the Company's LNG storageand regasiﬁcation terminal in Ensenada, Baja California, which stores LNG on behalf of customers, regasiﬁes customers’LNG and delivers the resulting natural gas to the Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system. The Company’s LNG terminal providesits customers with a secure delivery point for LNG and the option value of access to the Mexican and Southern Californianatural gas markets.
The second operation is IEnova Marketing, the Company's subsidiary that has contracted 50% of the capacity ofthe Company’s LNG terminal This subsidiary has contracted to purchase LNG, which it stores in LNG terminal until it isregasiﬁed and used to serve its customers, including the CFE’s Presidente Juarez power plant and the Company’sTermoelectrica de Mexicali power plant,

LNG Terminal
LNG is natural gas that has been cooled to approximately -l60° Celsius in order to condense the gas into a liquidLiquefaction of natural gas reduces its volume by a factor of 600, making it more feasible to transport by ship or thick
The Company’s LNG terminal consists of:
° one marine berth for the unloading of LNG cargoes by cryogenic LNG marine tankers;
' two insulated full-containment LNG storage tanks with an aggregate of 320,000 m3 (73.3 MMTh) ofstorage capacity;and
° a nitrogen generation facility that generates nitrogen from the surrounding air Via membrane separation, which isthen injected into the regasiﬁed LNG, when necessary, to lower its heating content to meet pipeline gas qualitystandards in Mexico and the United States.
The Company’s LNG terminal has firm natural gas send-out capacity of 1,300 MMcfd (13.5 MMThd). TheCompany’s LNG terminal can also be expanded to accommodate an additional marine berth and two additional LNG storagetanks in the future.
Operation afThe Company '5 LNG Terminal
The diagram below illustrates the operation of the Company‘s LNG terminal. First, the customers deliver LNGfrom cryogenic LNG tankers to the terminal for storage in the tanks (see 1 below), where they maintain ownership of theLNG that the Company stores on their behalf. When the customers request natural gas from the Company, it moves LNGfrom the storage tanks through a send-out pump (see 2 below) to open rack Vaporizers (see 3 below), where the LNG isregasiﬁed using heat drawn from ambient-temperature seawater that the Company pumps through the vaporizers (see 4below). After ﬂowing through the vaporizers, the sea water used to regasify the LNG is returned to the ocean (see 5 below)at an average temperature of only 2° Celsius less than when it entered the LNG facility, in compliance with local andinternational standards, When the LNG regasiﬁcation process is complete, the Company delivers its customers” resultingnatural gas to Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system (see 6 below)

Because there is a large temperature difference between the LNG and ambient conditions, a very small portion ofthis LNG is continuously converted back to a gaseous state as the LNG warmsi This gas is referred to as boil—off gas. Asindicated in the above diagram, the boil-off gas can either be returned to the Company’s customers’ cryogenic LNG marinetankers, if they are still in the marine berth (see 7 above), or sent to a boil-off gas compressor (see 8 above)‘ Once the gaspasses through the boil-offgas compressor, it can be delivered to Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system.
All electricity required for the operation of the Company’s LNG terminal is generated on-site through ﬁve gas-ﬁredcombustion turbine generators, which are powered by a small amount of natural gas resulting from boil off and/orregasiﬁcation, which all of the Company’s customers provide to the Company at no charge whenever they store LNG in theterminal. The Company’s LNG terminal has a redundant design with respect to most of its major components such as pumps,

===================================================

vaporizers and combustion turbine generators, which allows it to continue operating at its ﬁrm send-out capacity whileconducting maintenance on, or experiencing an unplanned outage of, those components.
Internal temperature of the Company ’5 LNG storage tanks,
In order for the Company’s LNG terminal to be operational, and in order to prevent equipment damage that couldbe caused by the thermal expansion of certain components during warming, the internal temperature of the Company’s LNGterminal storage tanks must be maintained at all times at a temperature no higher than approximately -160° Celsiust To keepthe storage tanks at the required temperature, the Company must constantly maintain a minimum volume of LNG in theterminal. Because ofcurrent natural gas market conditions, the delivery ofLNG cargoes t0 the LNG terminal by the capacityholders has been limited Only one of the capacity holders, the Company’s subsidiary IEnova Marketing, has delivered LNGcargoes t0 the terminal, which it purchases from one of the Company’s U,S. afﬁliates, Sempra Natural Gas, pursuant to along-term LNG purchase and sale agreement. Sempra Natural Gas has agreed to make a limited number of LNG cargoesavailable to IEnova Marketing for purchase each year for the express purpose of maintaining a sufﬁcient volume of LNG inthe Company’s terminal such that the terminal can remain continuously operational. IEnova Marketing has agreed to usereasonable efforts to deliver minimum quantities ofLNG t0 the Company’s LNG terminal. The Company’s LNG tenninal’scustomers are not otherwise obligated under the terms of their ﬁrm storage services agreements to supply minimum quantitiesof LNG If the Company is unable to obtain sufﬁcient volumes ofLNG from the capacity holders to maintain the minimumrequired internal temperature of the Company’s LNG terminal, the Company will need to secure such volumes in the openmarket. See “Risk Factors — Risks Relating to The Company’s business and Industry — The Company may be exposed tohigh costs to acquire LNG in order to maintain the operations of the Company’s LNG terminal.

Natural Gas Distribution BusinessOverview
The Company’s subsidiary ECOGAS was awarded the ﬁrst distribution permit given to a private company to buildand operate a natural gas distribution system in Mexico under the 1995 natural gas regulation Through its approximately3,852 km of pipelines, as of December 31, 2017 the ECOGAS distribution system served in excess of 120,000 residential,commercial and industrial customers in northern Mexico, with operations in the distribution zones of Mexicali, Chihuahua(sewing the cities of Chihuahua, Delieias, Meoqui, Cuauhte'moc and Anéhuae) and La Laguna—Durango (serving the citiesofTorreén, Gémez Palacio, Lerdo and Durango).
In addition to receiving the ﬁrst distribution permit under the 1995 natural gas regulation, the Company becamethe ﬁrst private distribution company to meet its build-out obligations to the Mexican government in terms of amount ofinvestment and number of customers. Since the ECOGAS distribution system became operational, the Company hasendeavored to market natural gas as a better alternative to LPG for industrial, commercial and residential consumption inthe Company’s markets. The following chart illustrates the growth in volume of natural gas sold by the distribution businessover the last four years.

The natural gas distribution business includes the following key activities:
' Purchasing natural gas ﬁom the Company‘s suppliers;
- Receiving natural gas into the Company’s system and transportng it through the distribution network- Maintenance of the Company’s pipelines and Other equipment;
- Connecting the Company’s customers to the ECOGAS system;
- Delivering natural gas into the Company’s customers’ homes and businesses;
- Metering, invoicing and collecting payment for gas delivered;
- Customer service activities for the Company’s existing customers; and
- Marketing activities to increase the Company’s customer base.
123
===================================================
127.hocr: 
The Company’s revenues are derived from service and distribution fees charged to its customers through monthlyinvoices The purchase price the Company pays for natural gas is based on international price indexes and is passed throughto its customers. However, the Company enters into hedging transactions with respect to these prices to reduce potentialvolatility in the price for natural gas that its customers ultimately pay, The service and distribution fees charged by theECOGAS system are regulated by the CRE, which performs a review of rates every ﬁve years and monitors prices chargedto end-users The rates for the Company’s Mexicali, Chihuahua and La LagunaeDurango distribution zones are currentlyunder review by the CRE. The current structure of natural gas prices minimizes the market risk to which the Company isexposed, as the rates are adjusted regularly based on inﬂation or ﬂuctuations in foreign exchange rates, The adjustments forinﬂation include cost components incurred both in Mexico and the United States, so that United States costs can be included
in the ﬁnal rates

Natural Gas F ired Power Generation BusinessTcrmocléctrica dc Mexicali
The Company owns and operates the Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant in Mexicali, Baja California, adjacentto the MexicinS. border. This 625 MW, natural gas-ﬁred, combined-cycle power generation facility commencedcommercial operation in June 2003 and is well-positioned to access both the United States and Mexican electricity grids,The power plant is connected to the Gasoducto Rosarito pipeline system, which allows it to receive regasiﬁed LNG fromthe Company’s LNG terminal as well as gas supplied from the United States on the North Baja pipeline. Termoeléctrica deMexicali’s customer base is currently comprised OfCalifornia utilities, California municipalities and energy service providers.
This facility is a modern, efﬁcient, combined-cycle plant that employs advanced environmental technologies thatmeet or exceed the environmental standards ofboth Mexico and California, it has General Electric MS7241FA gas turbines,inlet chilling and evaporative cooling components. The design of the facility also contributes positively to the environmentalquality of the local area by using untreated sewage water for cooling that comes from the Zaragoza Lagoons in Mexicali,located 13 km from the site. The sewage water is received in the facility’s water treatment plant and treated in biologicalreactors, This process eliminates biological contaminants and signiﬁcantly reduces other contaminants in the water such asnitrogen, phosphorus, heavy metals, and agricultural and industrial chemicals, and salts The treatment of this water improveswater quality in the nearby irrigation canal (Rio Nuevo).
Termoele’ctrica de Mexicali is directly interconnected by a double-circuit 230 kilovolt dedicated transmission lineto the grid controlled by the California Independent System Operator at the Imperial Valley substation and is capable ofproviding energy to a wide range of potential customers in California While the entire output of the plant is currently soldto the US. grid, the physical interconnection may be modiﬁed by building a two kilometer transmission line, subject to thereceipt of the requisite permits, including those granted by the CRE, so that all or a portion of the plant’s output could bedelivered to the CFE’s La Rosita substation.

Power Purchase Agreements
The Company is party to an energy management services agreement with the afﬁliate, Sempra Generation, withrespect to the electricity generated at the Company’s Termoele'ctrica de Mexicali power plant. Pursuant to this agreement,which is effective as of January 1, 2012, Sempra Generation has marketed and served as scheduling coordinator for theCompany’s electricity sales and performed other related administrative, hedging and US. regulatory support tasks on theCompany's behalf. Under this agreement, the Company reimburses Sempra Generation’s expenses in connection with theseservices and pays Sempra Generation an annual energy services fee based on the level ofservice provided to the Company’sTermoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant (depending on, among other factors, the amount of energy scheduled and sold bySempra Generation). The term of this agreement runs through 2017. This agreement replaced a prior agreement with SempraGeneration for the full capacity of the Tennoele'ctrica de Mexicali power plant. Whereas under the prior agreement SempraGeneration reimbursed the Company for the natural gas required for electricity generation at the power plant, under thecurrent energy management services agreement the Company bears the cost of the natural gas used to fuel the power plant,and the Company sells the electricity generated by the power plant on a merchant basis, which creates greater volatility inthe income generated by this facility.
Natural Gas Purchase Agreement
The Company supplies between 67 MMcfd (0.7 MMThd) and 101 MMcfd (1.1 MMThd) of natural gas to theTermoele’ctrica de Mexicali power generation facility, which the Company purchases directly from the Company’s subsidiaryIEnova Marketingi Under a previous agreement between the Company and J PM Ventures Energy, J PM Ventures Energysold natural gas to the Company at a price that was less than the rate the Company would have otherwise had pay to have

Wind Power Generation Business
Enqgia Sierra Judrez
The Energia Sierra Juarez wind powered generation project is located along mountain ridges in the Sierra de JuarezMountains in Baja California, Mexico This region has one of the strongest wind resources on the west coast of NorthAmeriea,The initial phase ofthis potential project is located about 1 12 km south 0fSan Diego. It interconnects to the existing SouthwestPower link at the Company’s afﬁliate SDG&E’s East County Substation in eastern San Diego County via a new cross—bordertransmission line, It could also potentially connect directly with the Mexican power grid.
The initial phase of Energia Sierra Juarez generates up to 155 MW from 47 wind turbines, or enough power forapproximately 65,000 average US. homes. Based on ﬁve years ofmeteorological data, the Company expects that these windturbines will operate at a net capacity factor ofbetween 34% and 36% (net capacity factor is a measure of the percentage ofpeak power a facility generates on average over an extended period 0ftime, reﬂecting wind resource availability and otherfactors). Electricity generated from the initial phase of Energia SieITa Juarez is sold entirely to the Company’s afﬁliateSDG&E pursuant to a 20-year power purchase agreement, In July 2014 the Company sold a 50% interest in the initial phaseof this project to certain afﬁliates of InterGen.
In November 2017, the Company executed a 20-year power purchase agreement with San Diego Gas & ElectricCompany The contract will be supplied through a new wind power generation facility that will be located in the municipalityofTecate in Baja California The project will have a capacity of 108 MW and will require an investment of approximatelyUSD$150 millions The development of this project is subject to the receipt of regulatory approvals, including from theCalifornia Public Utilities Commission (obtained in January 2018) and the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission Itis also subject to obtaining consents from ﬁnancing parties and partners,
The Company believes that utilities located throughout California are prime potential customers for the powergenerated by this project, and if the Company obtains additional permits it has the potential to also sell this power in theMexican wholesale market. California is one of the most politically supportive regions in the United States for renewablepower generation development, with a legislated target for renewable energy generation of 33% of retail sales by 2020,Mexico is also politically supportive ofrenewable energies, and wind farms in particular,

Key Arrangements
Power Purchase Agreement
Ventika has power supply agreements that, when considered j ointly, constitute agreements to purchase 100% of thecapacity of the wind farms for 20 years beginning April 2016. Such agreements have been entered into with subsidiaries,afﬁliates and related parties of Femsa, Cemex, FCA, DeAcero and Tecnolégico de Monterrey. The agreements aredenominated in US, Dollars at ﬁxed prices, and they escalate annually at 2.5%.
The main characteristics of the power supply agreements (PPAs) that Ventika maintains are that (i) provided thatVentika delivers the power to CFE’s substation, each counterparty has the obligation to consume pre—agreed minimumamounts or energy, and a failure to do so requires such counterparty to cover the respective tariffs (take-or—pay); (ii) anysurplus amount to the agreed amounts under the power supply agreements may be acquired by the counterparties at a discountrate, or may be directly supplied to CFE at market prices; (iii) include pre-arranged Dollar denominated tariffs; and (iv)subject to various rules, conditions and speciﬁc situations for each agreement, the counterparties to such agreements maynot terminate them without breach by Ventika, and if they do terminate such counterparties would be contractually obligatedto pay to Ventika, termination payments on the amounts established in such ﬁnancings, and the minimum purchase obligationsagreed in the relevant contract that are pending exercise and payment,
Since CFE requires capacity payments to industrial and commercial users of power, such capacity acquired byVentika’s counterparties may be credited by the CFE. Under the power supply agreements, each counterparty 0f Ventikashall undertake such capacity payments to Ventika.
Since the interconnection point is the sale point, through the interconnection agreement with CFE, transmissionservices and interconnection Ofelectricity that Ventika collects are equal to those collected by CFE for such services.
Ogeration and Maintenance Agreement
The operator, an afﬁliate ofAcciona, provides Ventika with operation and maintenance services for a 5 year term,automatically renewed for equal periods until reaching 20 years of services. Through these agreements, the Operatorguarantees the availability of each wind farm within the limits established in such agreements and for the effective term ofeach agreement. According to these agreements, the Operator renders operation and management services to Ventika thatare standard for projects of this kind, and the Operator is obligated (within the limits of each agreement) to operate the windfarms in accordance with applicable law and with the different permits and authorizations that apply to each project, includingcontracts and rights of use for the land, Ventika’s operational plans and instructions, interconnection contracts, and otherapplicable contracts and documents. The Operator is responsible for obtaining the necessary personnel for the performanceof its services and for obtaining proper insurance for the performance of its services.
The obligations of the Operator under these contracts are guaranteed by Acciona Energia, S.A., for up to the limitsagreed in each contract and in the relevant guarantee.
The payment mechanism includes an annual fee that is adjusted depending on the operation of the wind farms. Thisbeneﬁt-sharing mechanism is an incentive for the Operator to gain more real availability compared to the one guaranteed inthe agreements, The penalty for Acciona is the payment of unearned income due to the lack of the guaranteed availability,for up to a maximum of the annual payment for operation and maintenance, as agreed in such contract.
Monitoring and the control of operations of each turbine is carried out through the SCADA system. Routinemaintenance is carried out by Acciona’s staff.
Asset Management Agreement
Ventika maintains asset management services agreement with Cemex. Through each of these agreements, Cemexagrees (i) to render management and surveillance services over the assets, inventory, accounts receivable, invoicing and otherassets and services; (ii) to cause the performance of the principal agreements executed by Ventika, including those forengineering, procurement and construction, operation and management, ﬁnancing, interconnection, communication andmanagement of ﬁnancial issues with lenders, management of the self—supply and, power supply agreements, etc. The termof this agreement is of 5 years starting from the commercial operation date ofeach agreement (April 2016), with automaticrenewal for a period of 5 years.

SEMARNAT dismissed the motions and the plaintiffs ﬁledmotions for annulment against the respective rulings before the Federal Court ofTax and AdministrativeJustice (Tribunal Federal de Justicia Fiscal yAdministrativa, TFJFA), in Mexico city. In January 2006and May 2013, the TFJFA issued the judgments declaring null and void the rulings through whichSEMARNAT dismissed the motions for annulment ordering SEMARNAT to issue new rulings in theterms set forth in such judgments, In the case of Castro and Valdez, SEMARNAT admitted the motionand in January 2012 it issued a resolution ratifying the validity 0fthe MIA. In March 2012, Valdez ﬁledbefore the TFJFA a motion for annulment against the ruling issued by SEMARNAT and ECA ﬁled beforethe Collegiate Circuit Court for the Federal District, 21 motion against the ruling whereby the TFJFAordered the admittance 0f the motion ﬁled by Valdez, In the case ofPalafox, SEMARNAT has not issuedits resolution on the MIA yet, The management of the Company deems that the claims of Castro, Valdezand Palafox are unfounded.

The purpose of such claim is to procure a declaration ofnullity 0f the property rightsgranted by the National Agrarian Registry regarding some plots of land where ECA’S Terminal is located,as well as the return of another plot which allegedly is located in the same place, based on the argumentthat the property titles issued in favor of the ECA‘s former owners were issued improperly and withoutconsidering the existing property rights of such immovable property. In September 2011 was held adeﬁnitive hearing on the subject, where the plaintiffs offered evidence to extend their claim. The judgedid not admit the evidence, and before issuing the judgment, the plaintiffs ﬁled a constitutional claimagainst the refusal of the judge to the admittance of the evidence. The action of the judge is suspendedby the constitutional claim, and, the constitutional trial cannot continue until the Court serves notice ofthe civil claim to the other defendants, which has not happened. The Company deems that the claim isungrounded‘

The Company
The Company is the ﬁrst private-sector publicly traded energy infrastructure company on the Mexican StockExchange and one of the largest private sector energy companies in Mexico in terms ofmarket share. The Company develops,builds and operates energy infrastmcture. Its activities in Mexico include several business lines that encompass a signiﬁcantportion of the Mexican energy infrastructure value chain that is open to private investment.
The Company’s assets are divided between two business segments: (1) gas segment, which includes natural gasand LPG pipelines and storage, compression of natural gas, ethane transportation for liquid and gas phases, LNG storage,distribution of natural gas and reﬁned products transponation and storage; and (2) power segment, which includes powergeneration by Termoele’ctrica de Mexicali power plant, a natural-gas-ﬁred, combined-cycle power generation facility that iscurrently held for sale, wind power generation facilities Energia Sierra Juarez and Ventika, and four solar power generationfacilities that are under constmction. The Company’s assets generate revenues primarily under US, Dollar—denominatedcontracts on a ﬁrm basis, which are long-term in nature and entered into with predominantly stable, creditworthyeounterparties‘
In February 2016, the Board ofDirectors approved a plan to market and sell the Termoelectrica de Mexicali powerplant. Accordingly, its ﬁnancial results for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 are presented in theConsolidated Statements of Proﬁt and Loss as discontinued operations; likewise, the assets and liabilities ofTermoele'ctricade Mexicali were reclassiﬁed to the current in the line of assets held for sale and liabilities related to assets held for sale, inthe Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
As a result ofchanges to Mexican gas regulation in 1995, the Company was one 0fthe ﬁrst private companies toenter the energy infrastructure business in Mexico in the mid»l990’s. Speciﬁcally, these reforms allowed privateparticipation in gas pipelines, distribution and storage During the last 23 years, the Company has increased its presenceas a leader in private investment in the Mexican energy sector (including through new projects development, organicgrowth, acquisitions and a diversifying its customer base), investing approximately USD$7‘6 billion in Mexican energyinfrastructure, including acquisitions and investments through joint ventures,
The Company’s achievements as pioneers in private investment in Mexican energy infrastructure include thefollowing:
The Company was the ﬁrst private company to be awarded a natural gas distribution contract through a publicauction following the 1995 reform of the regulatory framework for the Mexican energy sector; the Companyowns and operates a natural gas distribution utility, ECOGAS, in three distribution zones: Mexicali since 1996(sewing the city of Mexicali), Chihuahua since 1997 (serving the cities of Chihuahua, Delicias, Meoqui,Cuauhtémoc and Anéhuac) and La Laguna—Durango since 1999 (sewing the cities of Torreén, Gémez Palacio,Lerdo and Durango);
The Company built the ﬁrst natural gas pipeline in the state of Baja California, and the Company has been thesole developer ofopen-access natural gas pipelines in Baja California (a region which previously did not haveaccess to US. or Mexican natural gas pipeline systems);
The Company’s natural gas pipelines in Baja California allowed the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission(Comisién Federal de Electricidad) to convert its power generation facilities from fuel oil to natural gas, andthe Company is one of the major suppliers of natural gas to the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission inBaja California;

Matters on ESJ
In November 2011, Terra Peninsular, AC1, a Mexican environmental organization, ﬁled an administrativelawsuit with the Mexican Federal Tax and Administrative Court (FTAC) in Mexico City challenging theMexican Environmental Protection Ministry’s issuance of an environmental authorization to EnergiaSierra Juarez for the construction and operation of a wind electric generation project. Terra Peninsularalleged that it was not notiﬁed with the resolution granting to Energia Sierra Juarez the environmentalauthorization and, that the environmental authorization was not evaluated in compliance with applicablelaw, and further alleged that had the Mexican Environmental Protection Ministry done so, it would havedenied the environmental authorization, The FTAC denied a provisional injunction sought by TerraPeninsular, but admitted Terra Peninsular's complaint. The court denied the ﬁnal injunction requested forTerra Peninsular as well. Energia Sierra Juarez and the Mexican Environmental Protection Ministry haveﬁled their responses to Terra Peninsular complaint in June 2012, contending that the environmentalauthorization was validly issued and the only one who should have been notiﬁed ofthe resolution, sinceit is the holder of the authorization, For the importance of the matter, same was referred to the HigherChamber ofthe FTAC, which in public session of the let ofAugust 2017, -by unanimous votes oftheMagistrates— resolved to dismiss the action, because TP ﬁled the claim out 0ftime, because it was ﬁledalmost a year after the issuance of the authorization, when the law provides a 15 days period to do so.The FTAC's decision was supported by several documents provided by ES] to prove that fact. TP showedno interest in continuity of the trial, because on several occasions to be served with the sentence at theaddress indicated to receive notiﬁcations, the Court's actuary took note that the address was unoccupiedand no person knew or had data of TP or his lawyers. The law establishes that if there is a change ofaddress, the Party must inform the Court And because there was no notiﬁcation on the change in theaddress provided, the TFJFA considered the notiﬁcation was fulﬁlled The Court waited a period of 15days for the ﬁling of an appeal against the judgment. When no appeal was ﬁled, the TFJPA declared thatthe judgment was ﬁnal.
The operations ofECA’s Terminal and ESJ’s wind farm have not been affected as a resultof the proceedingsdescribed above and they continue operating normally during the process thereof. However, if any of suchproceedings was resolved unfavorably for the Company, the operations of ECA’s Terminal and/or 133]wind farm might be affected adversely and signiﬁcantly, which in turn might have a signiﬁcant adverseeffect on the activities, perspectives, the ﬁnancial position, the operation results and the cash ﬂows of theCompany
Except for the affairs stated above, neither the Company nor its assets are subject to any other legal actiondifferent from those arisen in the normal course of business

Factors Affecting the Company’s results of Operations
The following are certain key factors that affect, or have recently affected, the Company’s results of operations.These should be read in conjunction with the risks and uncenainties discussed under “Risk Factors.”
RevenuesRevenue generated by each of the Company’s businesses is affected by the following factors:
- The Company’s businesses are subject to regulation and permitting requirements of federal, state and localgovernmental entities in Mexico. Although certain rates the Company charges customers for certain servicesare not regulated, many prices, fees and rates the Company charges customers in gas and power segmentsrequire approval from the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission. Accordingly, the Company cannotunilaterally modify these prices, fees and rates, which restricts the Company’s operational ﬂexibility, TheMexican Energy Regulatory Commission adjusts regulated rates periodically in accordance with applicableregulations, and the Company has no control over these adjustments Although the established prices, fees andrates are generally based on costs, the Company’s proﬁt could decrease if it is unable to raise prices or rates tokeep up with costs
- The Company depends on a limited number ofcustomers with whom the Company has entered into long-termagreements. These agreements are, in general, subject to:
° Early termination provisions for the failure of a party to perform its obligations under the agreement orin the event of insolvency of any of the parties;
- Suspension or termination provisions forforcc majcure events beyond the control of the parties; and
- Substantial limitations ofremedies for other failures to perform by any ofthe parties, including limitationson damages to amounts that could be substantially less than those necessary to provide Full recovery ofcosts for breach of the agreements.
- If the Company is unable to collect payments from customers under these agreements for any of thesereasons or otherwise, the Company's revenue could decrease.
' The Company’s LNG terminal’s primary revenue stream is generated through long—term ﬁrm storage servicesagreements with its third-paity customers, Shell and Gazprom, as well as with the subsidiary IEnova Marketing,which purchases LNG for storage and regasiﬁcation at the Company's LNG terminal. Each of the customers mustpay for its full contracted LNG storage capacity, natural gas send-out capacity and nitrogen facility capacityregardless of whether it actually delivers LNG to the terminal. IEnova Marketing generates revenues by purchasingLNG for storage and regasiﬁcation in the Company’s LNG terminal and selling natural gas that is consumed by the

===================================================
159.hocr: 
Mexican Federal Electricity Commission at its Presidente Juarez power plant, by the Company’s Termoele'etricade Mexicali power plant and by other consumers pursuant to natural gas supply contracts covering 100% of its LNGterminal natural gas send-out capacity. IEnova Marketing also generates revenues from payments it receives to theextent its LNG supplier, the Company’ S US. afﬁliate Sempra Natural Gas, does not deliver LNG t0 IEnova Marketingpursuant to a long-term LNG supply contract Relatively high prices for LNG in Asian markets, together with lownatural gas prices in Mexico and the United States, have reduced the number ofexpeeted shipments of LNG cargoesto IEnova Marketing by Sempra Natural Gas. Accordingly, the Company also depends on revenue derived fromthese payments. Under a long-term supply contract with Sempra Natural Gas, the payments made by Sempra NaturalGas to IEnova Marketing have been sufﬁcient to compensate IEnova Marketing for the storage and transportationcosts incurred by IEnova Marketing resulting from Sempra Natural Gas’ failure to deliver required LNG cargoes.See “Related Party Transactions and Conﬂicts of Interest.
- The price of natural gas is subject to market conditions beyond the Company’s control, The Mexican EnergyRegulatory Commission requires natural gas distributors to pass the cost of natural gas through to their customerswithout obtaining a margin from the sale of natural gas. As a result, the cost of natural gas effectively offsets theamount ofrevenue from natural gas sales, However, the proﬁt margin obtained by natural gas distributors, includingthe natural gas business, is derived from natural gas distribution fees and other related services‘ Accordingly, totalrevenue for the natural gas distribution business is impacted by market swings in natural gas prices and the Company’ 5customers’ preference for natural gas relative to other energy sources, such as LPG, and the proﬁt derived fromdistribution fees and other related services can decrease in response to decreases in overall demand for natural gas,
' Customer demand in gas and power segments is also impacted by seasonality in the United States market, and withrespect to natural gas distribution, general economic conditions in Mexico. See “7 Mexican Economic Environment.”Lower customer demand due to seasonality or unfavorable economic conditions could lower the Company’s revenueand proﬁts,
- The markets and pipelines to which the Company delivers natural gas and LPG typically establish minimum qualityspeciﬁcations for the delivered natural gas and LPG. These speciﬁcations can vary by pipeline or markets. If thequality of natural gas or LPG that the Company delivers fails to meet the applicable product quality speciﬁcations,the pipeline or market may refuse to accept all or a part ofthe delivery or may invoice the Company for the coststo handle the non-conforming products. In those circumstances, the Company may be required to ﬁnd alternativemarkets for the delivery or stop accepting non-conforming product into the Company's pipelines, which couldreduce the Company’s through-put volumes or revenue,
- The Company may use ﬁnancial derivative instruments in the ordinary course of the Company’s business, TheCompany uses these instruments for hedging purposes However, they are not reﬂected as hedges in the Company’sﬁnancial statements because they do not qualify for hedge accounting due to certain technical requirements TheCompany does not hedge the entire exposure to market price volatility of its assets or contract positions, and thehedging will vary over time, Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy—related commodities can result frommultiple factors, including weather conditions, seasonality, changes in supply and demand, transmission ortransportation constraints or inefﬁciencies, availability of competitively priced alternative energy sources andcommodity production levels, If the Company does not hedge its exposure to market price volatility or the Company’scontract positions correctly, the Company could incur losses,
° The ECOGAS natural gas distribution business beneﬁted from a 12-year period of exclusivity with respect to eachof its three distribution zones The last of these exclusivity periods expired in 2011i Accordingly, the Companycould face competition from other distributors ofnatural gas in all of the distribution zones‘
Cost 0fNatural Gas
The cost of natural gas primarily consists of the cost of natural gas, costs of services, minor materials used in thepower generation process, labor costs and transportation costs. The principal factors that affect these costs include thefollowing:
- The Company’s results are affected by energy prices, including market prices for natural gas, LNG, electricity,LPG and petroleum. If the Company’s customers or suppliers fail to ﬁllﬁll their obligations under their contractswith it, the Company may be required to enter into alternative arrangements to honor underlying commitmentsby making purchases from other suppliers at then-current market prices‘

Gas SegmentPipelines and Storage Business
The Company’s pipeline business develops and operates systems for receiving, transporting, compressing, storing anddelivering natural gas, ethane and LPG throughout the states of Baja California, Chiapas, Chihuahua, Jalisco, NuevoLeén, Sinaloa, Sonora, San Luis Potosi, Tabasco, Tamaulipas and Veracruz. These systems (including assets underconstruction or operated through j oint ventures) feature:
More than 2,900 km of natural gas pipelines (of which approximately 800 km were under construction as ofDecember 2017) with an aggregate design capacity ofover 16,501 MMcfd (171.6 MMThd);
Eleven natural gas compression stations in operation, one in commissioning and three currently underconstruction, with an aggregate of over 588,810 horsepower;
190 km of LPG pipelines with a design capacity of 34,000 Bbld (1.9 MMThd);

===================================================

- The Company’s LNG business is also impacted by worldwide LNG market prices. High LNG prices in marketsoutside the market in which the Company’s LNG terminal operates have resulted and could continue to resultin lower than expected deliveries of LNG cargoes to the Company's LNG terminal, which could increase theCompany’s costs if it does not receive expected LNG cargo deliveries from third parties under existing supplyagreements and are instead required to obtain LNG in the open market at prevailing prices Any inability toobtain expected LNG cargoes could also impact the Company’s ability to maintain the minimum level ofLNGrequired to keep the Company’s LNG terminal in operation LNG market prices also affect the Company’sLNG marketing operations, through which the Company must purchase natural gas in the international marketto meet its contractual obligations to deliver natural gas to the Company’s customers, which could have aneffect on its proﬁt
- Currently, the ECOGAS natural gas distribution business relies on two afﬁliate companies, IEnova Marketingand SoCalGas, for the supply Ofnatural gas that the Company distributes to its customers. If any of these keysuppliers fails to perform and the Company is unable to obtain supplies ofnatural gas from alternate sources,the Company could lose customers and sales volume, and in some cases, it could be exposed to commodityprice risk and volatility.
Eﬂects 0/ Currency Exchange Rates on Income Tax Expense
Exchange rate ﬂuctuations and Mexican inﬂation can result in signiﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the Company’s incometax expense. The Company has us. Dollar-denominated receivables and payables that are subject to Mexican currencyexchange rate movements for Mexican income tax purposes. The Company also has deferred income tax assets and liabilitiesthat are denominated in Mexican pesos, which are translated to US Dollars for ﬁnancial reporting purposes In addition,the Company adjusts its monetary assets and liabilities for Mexican inﬂation for purposes of determining the Mexican incometax expense. See Note 247 to the Company’s audited ﬁnancial statements, included elsewhere in this report.
Under 1F RS, the Company is required to remeasure property, plant and equipment at each reporting period usingthe period-end Mexican peso exchange rate and change in inﬂation rate for the Company’s US. Dollar functional currencysubsidiaries. The impact from this period-end conversion for property, plant and equipment can result in signiﬁcantﬂuctuations in the Company’s income tax expense and deferred income tax balances. See Note 25.1 to the Company’saudited ﬁnancial statements, included elsewhere in this report.
Mexican Income Tax ReformsThe main effects of the tax reform for 2016 are as follows:
i. Capital investments made during the fourth quarter of 2015, and in 2016 and 2017, by companies engaged inthe construction and expansion of transponation infrastructure (eig., highways, roads and bridges) and in thegeneration, transportation, distribution and supply of electricity, would be subject to immediate depreciation
iii Subject to the satisfaction of the requirements applicable to tax deductions generally, companies engaged inthe generation of electricity would not be subject to thin capitalization rules and would be able to deduct allinterest payments to related parties located outside of Mexico, even where their debt-to»stockholders’ equityratio exceeded the maximum rate otherwise permitted by the Mexican Income Tax Law
iiii Public companies whose shares of stock are listed for trading in an authorized market and who reinvest theirproﬁts for the period from 2014 to 2016 would be allowed a credit against the 10% withholding tax otherwisepayable in connection with any dividends paid to individual shareholders The amount of such credit woulddepend on the year in which such dividends were paid (Le, 1% in 2017, 2% in 2018, and 5% in 2019 andthereafter)
iv. Companies engaged in the generation of electricity from renewable sources or through efﬁcient cogenerationsystems would be allowed to establish a new, adjusted pre-tax eamings account. As a result, these companies,which under the current regime are entitled to depreciate 100% of their investments in machinery and equipment,and accordingly, do not often accrue pre-taxed earnings for distribution as dividends, would be able to distributetheir proﬁts in the form of dividends not otherwise taxed at the company leveli

Market Risks Associated with the Merchant Power PlantThe results related to the Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant are affected by market conditions, as it is currentlyoperating on a merchant basis‘ Termoele’ctrica de Mexicali currently sells its power based on market conditions at the time
ofsale, so the Company cannot predict with certainty:
- The amount or timing of revenue it may receive from power sales;
The differential between the cost of operations and power sales revenue;
The effect of competition from other suppliers of power;
Regulatory actions or changes that may affect market behavior;
The demand for power in markets served by Termoelectrica de Mexicali relative to available supply; or
The availability of transmission to accommodate the sale of power‘
Several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced signiﬁcant price declinesdue to excess supply‘ Termoele'ctrica de Mexicali’s results could be adversely affected if it is unable to sufﬁciently sell itsoutput at prices that would require the Company to write off any of the capital already invested in the project as a result ofsigniﬁcant changes to market or regulatory conditions, among other factors, The Company manages risks at Termoele'ctricade Mexicali by optimizing among a mix of forward on—peak energy sales, daily and hourly spot market sales ofcapaeity,energy and ancillary services, and longer-term structured transactions, as well as avoiding short positions However, theCompany Cannot provide assurance regarding the implementation of these risk management measures or how successfulsuch implementation may be, and entering into long-term contracts in oversupplied markets could be difﬁcult

Value at Risk (VaR! Analysis
The VaR measure estimates the potential loss in pre-tax proﬁt, under normal market conditions, over a given holdingperiod for a speciﬁed conﬁdence level. The VaR methodology is a statistically deﬁned, probability-based approach that takesinto account market volatilities as well as risk diversiﬁcation by recognizing offsetting positions and correlations betweenproducts and markets, Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can be aggregatedto arrive at a single risk number.
Along with other tools, the Company uses VaR to measure its exposure to market risk primarily associated withcommodity derivative instruments that the Company holds. The Company uses historical volatilities and correlations betweeninstruments and positions in the calculations
The Company uses a one-day holding period and a 95 percent conﬁdence interval in its VaR calculations. The one-day 95 percent VaR number reﬂects the 95 percent probability that the daily loss will not exceed the repotted VaR,
The variance—covariance approach was used to calculate the VaR valuesi

As ofDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there is no explicit guidance under IFRS regarding whether entitiesoperating in rate-regulated environments should recognize assets and liabilities arising from the effects ofrate regulation.Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US. (US. GAAP”) provide speciﬁc guidance on this matterl
The IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) has previously commented that the US GAAP recognitioncriteria pertaining to rate-regulated accounting are not consistent with IFRS, The IASB issued IFRS 14, Regulatorydeferral accounts on January 30, 2014, as a pan of its project on this matter; however, such standard is not applicableto the Company as it is not a ﬁrst-time adopter of IFRS. As a result, the Company does not recognize rate-regulatedassets or liabilities in its Consolidated F inancial Statements, Management will continue to monitor the status offuturedeliberations by the IASB and IFRIC as it relates to this matter and its potential impact on the Company’s ConsolidatedF inancial Statements
Contingencies
The Company accrues losses for the estimated impacts ofvarious matters, situations or circumstances involvinguncertain outcomes.

Own Use Exemption
International Accounting Standard 39, “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement,” contains ascope exemption from derivative accounting treatment for physical delivery contracts of a non-ﬁnancial item for anentity’s “own use.” The scope exemption is meant to apply to ordinary physical supply arrangements, However, thestandard also seeks to identify contracts that are not used for operational puiposes as derivative instruments. If a non-ﬁnancial item can be settled “net” using cash or another ﬁnancial instrument, or by exchange of ﬁnancial instruments,it must be accounted for as a ﬁnancial instrument
There are various ways in which a contract can be net settled. In applying judgment to assess whether netsettlement is likely, the Company’s management takes into account past practices with respect to net settlement undersimilar contracts, past practices with respect to taking delivery and selling the item within a short period, and whetherthe commodity is readily convertible into cash.
The Company’s management reviews each physical delivery arrangement for non-ﬁnancial items to determinewhether a non-ﬁnancial item falls within the own use exemption from derivative accounting treatment
Determining Whether an Arrangement Contains a LeaseThe Company evaluates if an arrangement that does not take the legal form of a lease but conveys a right touse an asset in return for a series of payments should be accounted for as a lease, The Company’s management uses

Impairment afLong-LivedAssets (Goodwill)
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generatingunits to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the directors to estimate the futurecash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash—generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate presentvalue. Where the actual future cash flows are less than expected, a material impairment loss may arise. Impairmenttesting is performed on an annual basis.
Asset Decommissioning Obligatiuns
The estimated cost ofdecommissioning at the end of the useﬁil lives of the Company’s long—lived assets isreviewed periodically and is based on estimates at the date of the consolidated statements of ﬁnancial position of thepresent value of future costs expected to be incurred when assets are retired from service as required by law or per itscontractual obligations The payment dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are uncertain and dependenton the lives of the long-lived assets, but are currently anticipated to be between 25 to 50 years. The Company uses itslong-term “borrowing cost” rate as the discount rate for calculating its provision related to its decommissioning liabilities,which is the 30-year borrowing cost for companies in its industry with similar credit ratings, as measured by Bloomberg,

GdC acquisition, selected valuation methodology
lEnova Pipelines, formerly Gasoductos de Chihuahua, is a regulated business that will earn a return of its costsand a reasonable return on its invested capital, without other consideration; the value of the assets of a regulated businessis the value of its invested capital. Under this premise, the fair value of the ﬁxed assets of regulated businesses isequivalent to carrying value for ﬁnancial reporting purposes, as carrying value reﬂects the basis for which investedcapital is derived, and for which a regulated business is allowed to earn a reasonable return.
The Company concluded that the carrying value of the ﬁxed assets is deemed to be representative of fair Valuefor IFRS purposes
Ventika acquisition, selected valuation methodology
Based on the nature of the power facility and generally accepted industry practice, the Company relied on theIncome Approach, speciﬁcally the Discounted Cash Flow method.
Associated intangibles such as rights of way / easements are embedded in the value of the property plant andequipments
While the Cost Approach was not relied upon to derive the fair Value estimate, provided the Income Approachbeing the preferred approach to valuin g an operational wind power facility, it was considered for corroboratory purposesin relation to the fair value estimate derived utilizing the Income Approach. It is noted that the Company’s derived fairvalue estimate embeds a developer margin (i.ei, margin above the cost to develop/ construct the power project) that iswithin the reasonable range ofdeveloper margins expected for this type ofpower facility and at the stage of developmentassociated with Ventika (Lei, recently entering commercial operation)
In addition to what is described above, the Company used different estimates relating to operating statistics,revenues, operating expenses and cash ﬂow items.

Strengths
The Company believes the following competitive strengths distinguish it from its competitors and are critical to thecontinued successful execution of its strategy.
Cash ﬂow stability and visibility through long-term contracts. The Company has contracted a substantial portionof the capacity of its assets across its business segments through long-term agreements under which its customersare required to pay regardless of whether they use their contracted capacity This provides the Company with steadyand predictable long-term cash ﬂows. Substantially all of these contracts are US. dollar—denominated or US, dollar-indexed, with stable, creditworthy, private and public counterparties that include the Mexican Federal ElectricityCommission, CENAGAS and Pemex‘ In addition to enhancing the stability of the Company‘s cash ﬂows, theseﬁrm capacity agreements also minimize its direct exposure to commodity price risk. The average life 0 ~these currentcontracts, weighted in proportion to revenues, is approximately 19 years. The current fee structure of t 1e Company'slong-term contracts minimizes its market risk because the rates, some of which are regulated by the Mexican EnergyRegulatory Commission, are adjusted regularly to account for inﬂation or ﬂuctuations in exchange rates
Proven development capability and extensive experience operating diverse energy assets‘ With over 20 years ofexperience in Mexico, the Company has developed the necessary skills and relationships to suecessfu ly build, ownand operate critical energy infrastructure in Mexico‘ Over this time, the Company has established a proven trackrecord of building greenﬁeld and brownﬁeld projects and the ﬂexibility to acquire energy assets in existing andnew lines of business, such as its recent entries in the growing reﬁned products and solar generation sectors. Thisis highlighted by the Company's acquisition of Pemex TRI’s remaining 50% interest in IEnova Pipe ines for USD$114 billion in cash, plus the assumption of existing indebtedness of approximately USD$388 million; theacquisition of the 252 MW Ventika wind power generation facilities for a purchase price of USD$920 million; andthe acquisition from Pemex TRI 0f the remaining 50% interest in Ductos y Energeticos del Norte, which increasedthe Company's indirect ownership in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline from 25% to 50% See “-Recent Developments-Duetos y Energéticos del Norte Acquisition,” The Company made its ﬁrst investment in Mexico in 996, when itwon the ﬁrst private natural gas distribution permit awarded in Mexico, and subsequently developed the Ecogasbusiness into a model natural gas distribution company, The Company's largest project to date is the investment ofUSD$1.2 billion in the LNG terminals In addition, the Company completed the Sonora pipeline, which representsa total investment of approximately USD$110 billion, and through the former joint venture with Pemex TRI, theCompany completed the Los Ramones I pipeline, the Los Ramones Norte pipeline, the ethane pipeline and theGuadalajara LPG terminal, The Company believes that its experience in the energy sector positions it to takeadvantage of possible investment opportunities with developers looking for sales or spin-offs, in projects nearingcompletion, in companies seeking strategic partners, and in companies under ﬁnancial distress and seeking liquiditythrough the sale of assets,

Financing capacity to pursue new opportunities in the energy sector. The Company has secured a committedrevolving credit facility from a syndicate ofeight lenders for which Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation servesas administrative agent The Company refers to this as the Revolving Credit Facility, 1t permits borrowings up toUSD$1,170 million through August 21, 2020.

Goodwill impairment testing
As described in Note 13, of the oonsolidated ﬁnancial statements, in 2015 the Company acquired theremaining 50% equity in IEnova Pipelines, and 100% of the equity of Ventika resulting in therecognition of goodwill of $1,612 million. Management performed is ﬁrst annual goodwill impairmenttest during the fourth quarter which uses business and valuation assumptions that require judgement,including discount rates and long term projections of revenues and costs. The most relevant matters
addressed in our audit are as follows:
- The correct identiﬁcation and aggregation of reporting units for purposes of the goodwillimpairment test as supported by documentation or evidence of synergies.- Testing of discount rates and projections of cash flows
Our audit procedures focused mainly on testing relevant controls and substantive procedures overrelevant assumptions. We involved internal valuation specialists to assist us in auditing these matters.
Relevant contracts and transactions analysis
As described in Note 1.2 of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Company entered into severalrelevant transactions during the year, some of them requiring the determination of the appropriateaccounting that can haVe signiﬁcant implications to current and future ﬁnancial statements withrespect to the recognition, valuation, presentation and disclosures of the particular transaction.International Financial Reporting Standards require Management to apply its judgement to deﬁne theaccounting treatment with limited specific industry guidance provided. A typical analysis requires theCompany to determine whether it needs to consolidate a project; whether the arrangement contains alease, and if so, Its classification as a ﬁnance or operating lease; whether the contract meets the ownuse exemption or the deﬁnition of a derivative (to which hedge accounting could be applied) or itcontains embedded derivatives; or, whether, it should be accounted for under another model, such asa concession arrangement. Examples of such significant transactions include: the renewable energyprojects, new electric supply contracts, concession agreement and long term capacity contracts andacquisition or sale of subsidiaries‘
iOur audit focuses on the intemai controls and performing detailed risk assessment procedures to eachtransaction to determine the relevant aspects of judgement to design tailored audit procedures. Wealso involved our technical accounting specialists to assist us in auditing these matters.

The other information comprises informationincluded in the annual report, but does not include the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s reportthereon.

Responsibilities of Management and Those Charged with Governance for the ConsolidatedFinanclal Statements
Management is responsible for the pteparation and fair presentation of the consolidated financialstatements in accordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines isnecessary to enabEe the preparation of consolidated ﬁnancial statements that are free from materialmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error.
In preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, management is responsible for assessing the _Company’s ability to continue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to goingconcern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management either intends toliquidate the Company or ti) cease opemtions, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
Those charged with governance are responsible for overseeing the Company's ﬁnancial reportingprocess. ‘
Auditor's Responsibilities far the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the consolldated ﬁnancialstatements as a whole are free from material mlsstatement, whether due to fraud or ermr, and toissue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance Is a high level of assumnce,but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a materialmisstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered materialif, individually or In the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professio'nal judgment and maintainprofessional skepticism throughout the audit. We also:
. Identify and assess the risks of material mlsstatement of the consolidated financial statements,whether due to fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks,and obtain audit evidence that Is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for oneresulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions,misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
0 Obtain an understanding of Internal control relevant to the audlt ln order to design auditprocedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing anopinion on the effectiveness of the Company's internal control.
. Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related toevents or conditions that may cast signiﬁcant doubt on the Company's ability to continue as agoing concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to drawattention in our auditor's report to the related disclosures in the consolidated ﬁnancialstatements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modlfy our opinion. Our conclusions arebased on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’5 report. However, futureevents or conditions may cause the Company to cease to continue as a going concern.

Risks Relating to The Company’s Business and Industry

These regulations and permits may limit the Company’s operatingﬂexibility, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cashﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of the Company’s securities. For example, in order to obtain the favorableopinion of the Mexican Antitrust Commission (Comisio'n Federal de Competencia Econémica) in connection with apermit required for the operation of the Rosarito pipelines system, the Company was required to agree to divest 0f theMexicali components of ECOGAS natural gas distribution systems The Company has been subject to this obligationsince 2000 and has made good faith efforts to comply with the obligation to divest of the Mexicali gas distributionsystem, but have not yet located a purchaser for these assets, The Company has notiﬁed the Mexican AntitrustCommission of its inability to ﬁnd a purchaser and the Mexican Antitrust Commission has not yet imposed a deadlinefor this disposition at this time.

The Company cannot predict the future course of changes in laws and regulations that cover its activities orthe effeetthat this changing regulatory environment will have on its business. In addition, due to the complex, overlappingfederal, state and local regulatory regimes in which it operates, the Company may from time to time discover that it islacking, 0r non-compliant with, one or more of its permits, If there is a delay in obtaining any required regulatoryapproval or permit to conduct the Company’s operations, or if it fails to obtain or maintain any required approval orpermit, the Company may not be able to operate its energy infrastmcture projects, or the Company may be forced toincur additional costs, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.

The Company is subject to numerous envirunmental, health and safety regulations that may became morestringent in the future and may result in increased liabilities and increased capital expenditures.
The Company’s business is subject to comprehensive federal, state and local environmental, health and safetylegislation, as well as supervision by Mexican governmental agencies that are responsible for the implementation ofsuch laws, regulations, ofﬁcial standards and related policies. These laws, regulations and ofﬁcial standards mandate,among other requirements, that the Company obtains and maintains environmental, health and safety licenses forconstruction and operation of all facilities, including the facilities related to the transportation, storage and distributionof natural gas, LPG, ethane and reﬁned products, and the generation of electric energy These laws, regulations andofﬁcial standards may also require the Company to obtain and maintain the following with respect to the constructionand operation of its facilities: environmental impact authorizations; risk studies; accident prevention programauthorizations; forestry land use change authorizations; air emissions operation licenses; local land use permits andconstruction licenses; waste disposal permits and authorizations including hazardous, special management and urbansolid wastes; concession titles or permits for the use and exploitation of water and the discharge of wastewaters; andconcession titles for the use of federal zones, construction ofmaritime infrastructure or installation of new equipmentrequired for its operations, See “Business - Legal, Administrative and Arbitration Proceedings” The failure to obtainand maintain these authorizations, licenses, permits and concessions could materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
Even once obtained, compliance with authorizations, permits, concessions, regulations and license terms andconditions may be expensive, difﬁcult or economically unfeasible thereby curtailing ﬁJture operations, Moreover,governmental agencies could take enforcement action against the Company for its failure to comply with their laws,regulations, ofﬁcial standards and related policies. These enforcement actions could include, among other things, theimposition of economic ﬁnes or remediation obligations, the seizure of machinery and equipment, the revocation oflicenses and/or the temporary or permanent closure of part or all of a facility, and possibly imprisonment if environmentalViolations are classiﬁed as criminal offenses. Compliance with enhanced environmental, safety and health regulations,including as a result of any environmental contamination or pollution for which the Company may be held liable inthe future, could require it to divert resources to make capital expenditures. In addition, complying with environmentalhealth and safety laws, regulations, ofﬁcial standards and related policies, including obtaining related licenses, permits,concessions and/or authorizations, could cause delays in the schedule of construction and improvements of any of theCompany’s on-going projects and/or facilities for the transportation, storage and distribution of natural gas and otherhydrocarbons and for the generation of electricity. Private parties may also have the right to pursue legal actions toenforce compliance and to seek damages for personal injury, property damage, environmental damage caused to thirdparties or for non-compliance with respect to environmental laws, as well as compensation or remedial action of anyenvironmental damage, as may be the case, which is independent of any civil, criminal or administrative liability Thefailure to comply with these authorizations, permits, concessions, regulations and license terms and conditions couldmaterially adversely affect the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospectsand/or the market price of its securities
Mexico is also a patty to many international agreements regarding environmental protection The Companyanticipates that the regulation of its business operations under Mexican federal, state and local environmental laws andregulations will increase and become more stringent over time, including as a result of international agreements Suchinternational agreements, upon ratiﬁcation by the Mexican Senate, become a part of Mexican law. Under the NorthAmerican Agreement on Environmental Cooperation, or NAAEC, a side agreement to NAFTA, each country that is aparty to NAFTA, including Mexico, must ensure that its environmental laws and regulations are duly enforcedt Whilethe NAAEC does not empower any of the environmental agencies of the three NAFTA partners to enforce theenvironmental laws of another party, if a NAFTA partner fails to enforce its domestic environmental laws, it may besubject to the dispute mechanism created within the NAAEC, which may lead to monetary penalties, and in some cases,to the suspension ofNAFTA beneﬁts, the result of which could materially adversely affect the Company’s business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities. While it isdifﬁcult to predict the scope and effect of new environmental laws and regulations, such changes could materiallyadversely affect the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or themarket price of its securities.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies
2.1.
2.2.
Statement of compliance
The Consolidated F inancial Statements have been prepared in accordance with International FinancialReporting Standards (“IFRS”) as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (“IASB”).
Basis 0fpreparari0n
The Consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for certainﬁnancial instruments, and assets and liabilities recognized upon business combinations that are measured atrevalued amounts of fair values at the end ofrepot’ting period, as explained in the accounting policies below.(Please refer to Note 11.).
[1.
Historical cost
Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goodsand services.
F air value
Fair value (“FV”) is the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability inan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether thatprice is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair valueof an asset or a liability, the Company takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability ifmarket participants would take those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability atthe measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these ConsolidatedFinancial Statements is determined on such a basis, except for leasing transactions that are within thescope of IAS 17, Leases and measurement that have some similarities for fair value but are not fairvalue, such as net realizable value in IAS 2, Inventories or value in use in IAS 36, Impairment ofassets.In addition, for ﬁnancial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorized into Level 1, 2or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and thesigniﬁcance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
- Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilitiesthat the Company can access at the measurement date;

===================================================
241.hocr: 
2.3.
- Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observablefor the asset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and- Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Cansalidatian of F inunciul Statements
2.3.1. Basis ofcansolidation
The Consolidated F inancial Statements of IEnova incorporate the F inancial Statements of all entitieswhere it maintains control (its subsidiaries), Control is achieved when the Company:
- Has power over the investee;- Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement With the investee; and- Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns
The Company reassesses whether or not controls an investee if facts and Circumstances indicate thatthere are changes to one or more of the three control elements that were listed above.
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an investee, it has power over theinvestee when the voting rights are sufﬁcient to give it the practical ability to direct the relevant activitiesof the investee unilaterally‘ The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessingwhether or not the Company’s voting rights in an investee are sufﬁcient to give it power, including:
- The size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion ofholdings0f the other vote holders;
- Potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;
- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and
- Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have,the current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made,including voting patterns at previous shareholders’ meetings
Consolidation ofa subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceaseswhen the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Speciﬁcally, income and expenses of a subsidiaryacquired or disposed of during the year are included in the Consolidated Statement of Proﬁt and OtherComprehensive Income (0C1) from the date the Company gains control until the date when theCompany ceases to control the subsidiary.
Proﬁt or loss and each component of OCI are attributed to the owners of the Company and to the non-controlling interests. Total comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to the owners of theCompany and to the non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests havinga deﬁcit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the Financial Statements of subsidiaries to bring theiraccounting policies in line with the Company accounting policies.
All intercompany transactions, assets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash ﬂows relatingto transactions between members of the Company are eliminated in full on consolidation.

Leasing
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks andrewards ofownership 0f the beneﬁts. All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
24
===================================================
244.hocr: 
2. 9,1. The Company as lessor
Amounts payable by lessees under ﬁnance leases are recognized as receivables at the amount of theCompany's net investment in the leases. Finance lease income is distributed in the accounting periodsto reﬂect a constant periodic rate ofreturn 011 the Company's net investment with respect of the leases.
Rental income from operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevantlease. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to thecarrying amount of the leased asset and recognized on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
2.9.2. Company as lessee
Assets held under ﬁnance leases are initially recognized as assets of the Company at their fair valueat the inception of the lease, or if lower, the present value of the minimum lease payments. Thecorresponding liability to the lessor is included in the Consolidated Statements of F inancial Positionas a ﬁnance lease obligation.
Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so asto achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance expenses arerecognized immediately in proﬁt, unless they are directly attributable to qualifying assets, in whichcase they are capitalized in accordance with the Company's accounting policy on borrowing costs(Please refer to Note 2.18). Contingent rentals are recognized as expenses in the periods in which theyare incurred
Operating lease payments are recognized as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term,except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economicbeneﬁts from the leased asset are consumed Contingent rentals arising under operating leases arerecognized as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that income incentives received for holding operating leases, such incentives are recognizedas a liability. The aggregate beneﬁt of incentives is recognized as a reduction of rental expense on astraight line basis except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern inwhich economic beneﬁts from the leased asset are consumed.
2.10. Investments in joint ventures
A joint venture is a joint arrangement whereby the parties that have joint control of the arrangement haverights to the net assets of the joint mangement. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of controlof an arrangement, which exists only when decisions about the relevant activities require unanimous consentof the parties sharing control.
The results, assets and liabilities of the joint venture are incorporated in these Consolidated FinancialStatements using the equity method of accounting, except when the investment, or a portion thereof, isclassiﬁed as held for sale, in which case it is accounted for in accordance with IFRS 5, Non-current assetsheldfor sale and discontinued operations. Under the equity method, an investment in a joint venture isinitially recognized in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position at cost and adjusted thereafter torecognize the Company’s share of the proﬁt or loss and OCI of the joint venture.
When the Company’s share Oflosses of a joint venture exceeds the Company’s interest in that joint venture(which includes any long—tenn interests that, in substance, form part of the Company’s net investment in thejoint venture), the Company discontinues recognizing its share of further losses, Additional losses arerecognized only to the extent that the Company has incurred legal or constructive obligations or madepayments on behalf of the joint venture.
An investment in a joint venture is accounted for using the equity method from the date on which the investeebecomes a joint venture On acquisition ofthe investment in a joint venture, any excess of the cost of theinvestment over the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities of theinvestee is recognized as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment
25
===================================================
245.hocr: 
2.11.
Any excess of the Company’s share of the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets and liabilities over the costof the investment, after reassessment, is recognized immediately in proﬁt in the year in which the investmentis acquired
The requirements of IAS 39, F inancial instruments: recognition and measurement, are applied to detenninewhether it is necessary to recognize any impairment loss with respect to the Company’s investment in a jointventure. When necessary, the entire carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested forimpairment in accordance with IAS 36, Impairment QfAssets , as a single asset, by comparing its recoverableamount (higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying amount. Any impainneutloss recognized forms part of the carrying amount of the investment, Any reversal of that impairment loss isrecognized in accordance with IAS 36 to the extent that the recoverable amount of the investment subsequentlyincreases.
The Company discontinues the use of the equity method from the date when the investment ceases to be ajoint venture, or when the investment is classiﬁed as held for sale. When the Company retains an interest inthe former joint venture and the retained interest is a ﬁnancial asset, the Company measures the retainedinterest at fair value at that date and the fair value is regarded as its fair value on initial recognition inaccordance with IAS 39. The difference between the carrying amount of the joint venture at the date theequity method was discontinued, and the fair value of any retained interest and any proceeds from disposingof a part interest in the joint venture is included in the detennination of the gain or loss on disposal of thejoint venture. In addition, the Company accounts for all amounts previously recognized in OCI in relationto that joint venture 0n the same basis as would be required if that joint venture had directly disposed of therelated assets or liabilities Therefore, if a gain or loss previously recognized in OCI by that joint venturewould be reclassiﬁed to proﬁt on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities, the Company reclassiﬁes thegain or loss ﬁom equity to proﬁt (as a reclassiﬁcation adjustment) when the equity method is discontinued
The Company continues to use the equity method When an investment in an associate becomes an investmentin a joint venture or an investment in a joint venture becomes an investment in an associate. There is noremeasurement to fair value upon such changes in ownership interests
When the Company reduces its ownership interest in a joint venture but the Company continues to use theequity method, the Company reclassiﬁes to proﬁt the proportion of the gain or loss that had previously beenrecognized in OCI regarding that reduction in ownership interest if that gain or loss would be reclassiﬁed toproﬁt on the disposal of the related assets or liabilities.
When the Company conducts transactions with joint ventures, non—realized proﬁt and losses are eliminatedat the Company's ownership percentage in the joint venture
Business combination and assets acquisitian
A company shall determine whether a transaction or other event is a business combination by applying thedeﬁnition ofIFRS 3 Business Combinations, which requires that the assets acquired and liabilities assumedconstitute a business If the assets acquired are not a business, the Company shall account for the transactionor other event as an asset acquisition.
Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred ina business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fairvalues of the assets transferred by the Company, liabilities incurred by the Company to the former ownersof the acquiree and the equity interests issued by the Company in exchange for control of the acquiree,Acquisition-related costs are generally recognized in proﬁt or loss as incurred.
At the acquisition date, the identiﬁable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognized at their fairvalue, except for:
- Deferred tax assets or liabilities, and assets or liabilities related to employee beneﬁt arrangementsare recognized and measured in accordance with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 EmployeeBenefits, respectively,
26
===================================================
246.hocr: 
2.12.
- Assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with thatStandard.
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transfetred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in theacquiree (if any) over the net of the aequisition—date amounts of the identiﬁable assets acquired and theliabilities assumed. If, aﬁer reassessment, the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identiﬁable assetsacquired and liabilities assumed exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the aequiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held interest in the acquiree(ifany), the excess is recognized immediately in proﬁt as a bargain purchase gain.
Non»controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate shareof the Company’s net assets in the event ofliquidation may be initially measured either at fair value or at thenon-eontrolling interests’ proportionate share of the recognized amounts of the acquiree’s identiﬁable netassets. The choice ofmeasurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaetion basis. Other types ofnon-controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis speciﬁed in another IFRS.
When the consideration transferred by the Company in a business combination includes assets or liabilitiesresulting from a contingent consideration aIrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at itsacquisition—date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business combinationChanges in the fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as measurement period adjustments areadjusted retrospectively, with conesponding adjustments against goodwill, Measurement period adjustmentsare adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period (which cannotexceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date,
The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingent consideration that do not qualifyas measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingent consideration is classiﬁed. Contingentconsideration that is classiﬁed as equity is not remeasured at subsequent reporting dates and its subsequentsettlement is accounted for within equity. Other contingent consideration that is classiﬁed as an asset or aliability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 39, or IAS 37 Provisions.Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets, as appropriate, with the corresponding gain or loss beingrecognized in proﬁt.
When a business combination is achieved in stages, the Company’s previously held equity interest in theacquiree is remeasured to its acquisition-date fair value and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognizedin proﬁt Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date, that have previouslybeen recognized in OCI are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt where such treatment would be appropriate if that interestwere disposed of.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete by the end of the reporting period in whichthe combination occurs, the Company reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting isincomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see above), or additionalassets or liabilities are recognized, to reﬂect new information obtained about facts and circumstances thatexisted at the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognized at that date.
Goodwill
For the purposes ofimpairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Company’s cash-generating unitsthat are expected to beneﬁt from the synergies of the combination
A cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or morefrequently when there is indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carryingamount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata based on thecanying amount of each asset in the unit Any impairment loss for goodwill is recognized directly in proﬁtor loss in the Consolidated Statement of Proﬁt. A11 impairment loss recognized for goodwill is not reversedin subsequent periods.

C urban allowances
The Company has elected to account for carbon allowances, or emission allowances, (“CAs”) under theinventory model, whereby CAs are measured at a weighted-average cost. CAs allocated by a regulatory bodywill have a zero cost basis, CAs purchased at auction or ﬁ'om other market participants are recorded at theirpurchase price, and CAs acquired when the Company elects to physically settle carbon futures are recordedbased on the settlement price. The weighted—average cost ofCAs consumed (i.e., carbon emitted while poweris generated) is charged to cost of revenue of each reporting period, The CAs’ carrying value is evaluatedunder the “lower of cost or net realizable value” approach. The CAs inventory is classiﬁed as other currentassets or other non-current assets if it is expected to surrender the inventory within the term greater than oneyear beginning at the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position date. The CAs’ cash inﬂows and outﬂowsare classiﬁed as an operating activity in the Consolidated Statements ofCash Flows (Please refer Note 20),
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are presented in the Consolidated Statements of F inancial Position and rec ordedat acquisition cost, less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairmentlosses Acquisition costs include labor, material costs and construction service agreements,
The Company recognizes decommissioning liabilities for the present value of liabilities of future costsexpected to be incurred when assets are retired from service, if the retirement process is legally required andif a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made.
Property, plant and equipment include major expenditures for improvements and replacements parts, Whichextend useful lives or increase capacity. Routine maintenance costs are expensed as incurred
Properties in the course ofconstruction for production, supply or administrative purposes are carried at cost,less any recognized impairment lossr Cost includes professional fees and, for qualifying assets, borrowingcosts capitalized in accordance with the Company’s accounting policy. Such properties are classiﬁed to theappropriate categories of property, plant and equipment When completed and ready for intended use.Depreciation ofthese assets, on the same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are readyfor their intended use.
Land is not depreciated The buildings, equipment and other assets are stated at cost less accumulateddepreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is recognized to write-off the cost of assets (other than land and properties under construction)less their residual values over their useful lives, using the straight-line method. The estimated useful lives,residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect ofany changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
An item ofproperty, plant and equipment is derecognized upon disposal or when no future economic beneﬁtsare expected to arise ﬁom the continued use of the asset, Any gain or loss arising on the disposal or retirementof an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds andthe carrying amount of the asset and is recognized in proﬁt.
In tangible assets
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and/or assets acquisition and recognized separately ﬁomgoodwill and are initially recognized at their fair value at the acquisition date (which is regarded as theircost).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangibleassets acquired in a business combination and/or assets acquisition
are reported at cost less accumulated amortization and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis asintangible assets that are acquired separately.

Impairment 0ftangible and intangible assets (other than goodwill)
At the end of each reporting period, the Company reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangibleassets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss If anysuch indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent ofthe impairment loss (ifany). When it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset,the Company estimates the recoverable amount of the cash»generating unit to which the asset belongs Whena reasonable and consistent basis ofallocation can be identiﬁed, corporate assets are also allocated to individualcash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smallest group ofcash-generating units for whicha reasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identiﬁed‘
Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives and intangible assets not yet available for use are tested forimpairment at least annually, and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use,the estimated future cash ﬂows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂectscurrent market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to the asset for which theestimates of future cash ﬂows have not been adjusted
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount,the caxrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairmentloss is recognized immediately in proﬁt, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in whichcase the impainnent loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
When an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or a cash—generating unit)is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but such that the increased carrying amountshould not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss beenrecognized for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognizedimmediately in proﬁt.
When non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale, they are required to be measuredat the lower of their canying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The comparison of carrying amount andfair value less costs to sell is carried out at each reporting date while it continues to meet the held for salecriteria. As described in Note 12, an impairment loss related to TDM has been recognized in the ConsolidatedStatements of Proﬁt.
Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfet a liability inan orderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accordingly, a gain or loss couldarise once an actual sale is completed
Non-current assets classified as heldfor sale and discontinued operations
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale if their carrying amount Will be recoveredprincipally through a sale transaction rather than through continuing use‘ This condition is regarded as metonly When the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in its present condition subject onlyto terms that are usual and customary for sales ofsuch asset (or disposal group) and its sale is highly probable,Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify forrecognition as a completedsale within one year from the date of classiﬁcation.
When the Company is committed to a sale plan involving loss of control of a subsidiary, all of the assets andliabilities of that subsidiary are classiﬁed as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, regardlessof whether the Company will retain a non-controlling interest in its former subsidiary aﬁer the sale.
When the Company is committed to a sale plan involving disposal of an investment, or a portion of aninvestment, in an associate or joint venture, the investment or the portion of the investment that will bedisposed of is classiﬁed as held for sale when the criteria described above are met, and the Companydiseontinues the use of the equity method in relation to the ponion that is classiﬁed a held for sale.

The Company discontinues the use of the equity method at the time of disposal when the disposal results inthe Company losing signiﬁcant inﬂuence over the associate or joint venture,
Aﬁer the disposal takes place, the Company accounts for any retained interest in the associate or joint venturein accordance with IAS 39 unless the retained interest continues to be an associate or a joint venture, in whichcase the Company uses the equity method.
Non-eurrent assets classiﬁed as held for sale are measured at the lower of their previous carrying amount andfair value less costs to sell.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, whichare assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, areadded to the cost ofthose assets, mltil such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended useor sale,
To the extent that the Company generally borrows funds and uses them for the purpose of obtaining a qualifyingasset, the Company shall determine the amount ofbormwing costs eligible for capitalization by applying acapitalization rate to the expenditures on that asset. The capitalization rate shall be the weighted average ofthe borrowing costs applicable to the borrowings of the Company that are outstanding during the period,other than borrowings made speciﬁcally for the purpose of obtaining a qualifying asset The amount ofborrowing costs that the Company capitalizes during a period shall not exceed the amount ofbormwing costsit incurred during that period. For a relationship designated as cash ﬂow hedging, none of the effects of thederivative are included in capitalized interest
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure onqualifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalization,
All other borrowing costs are recognized in proﬁt in the period in which they are incurred.Employee beneﬁts
Payments to deﬁned contribution retirement beneﬁt plans are recognized as an expense when employeeshave rendered service entitling them to the contributions
In accordance with Mexican Labor Law, the Company provides seniority premium beneﬁts to its employeesunder certain circumstances. These beneﬁts consist of a one—time payment equivalent to 12 days wages foreach year of service (at the employee’s most recent salary, but not to exceed twice the legal minimum wage).payable to all employees with 15 or more years of service, as well as to certain employees tenninatedinvoluntarily prior to the vesting of their seniority premium benefit
For deﬁned beneﬁt retirement plans. which include pension plans as well as its seniority premium beneﬁts,the cost ofproviding beneﬁts is determined using the proj ected unit credit method, with actuarial valuationsbeing carried out at the end of each annual reporting period. Remeasurement comprising actuarial gains andlosses and the effect of the changes on the ﬂoor of the asset (if applicable), are immediately recognized inthe Consolidated Statement of Financial Position charged to the credit recognized in the ConsolidatedStatements of Proﬁt and OCI in the period in which they occur.
Remeasurement recognized in OCI is reﬂected immediately in retained earnings and will not be reclassiﬁedto proﬁt or loss. The Company presents service costs within administrative and other expenses in theConsolidated Statements of Proﬁt. The Company presents net interest cost within ﬁnance costs in theConsolidated Statements of Proﬁt. The retirement beneﬁt obligation recognized in the ConsolidatedStatements of Financial Position represents the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation as of the endof each reporting year.

terminated or otherwise modiﬁed, such termination or modiﬁcation could materially impact Mexico’s energy andenvironmental sectors.
The Mexican Federal Environmental Liability Law (Ley Federal de Responsabilidad Ambiental), whichbecame effective in July 2013, provides for signiﬁcant penalties for damages to the environment and could subject itto signiﬁcant liability in the event of any such damage. However, the Company cannot predict the outcome of anyaction brought against it or the extent to which it could be held liable under such law. See “Regulation, Permits andEnvironmental Matters.” The cost of remediating or providing compensation for any environmental damage could besigniﬁcant and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’ 5 business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations,cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
The C ampuny calm 0tpredict the patential effects on its business of the new legal framework for regulatingthe energy sector in Mexico.
Mexico has developed a new legal framework for the regulation of the hydrocarbon and electric power sectorsbased on a package of constitutional amendments approved by the Mexican Congress in December 2013 andimplementing legislation enacted in 2014, including the amendment of certain existing laws in August 2014 and theissuance of new regulations thereunder in October 2014‘ The new legal framework for the Company’s pipelines, naturalgas distribution and reﬁned products businesses is set forth in the new Mexican Hydrocarbons Law (Ley deHidrocarburos), the Mexican Hydrocarbon General Regulations (Reglamento de la Ley de Hidrocarburos) and theRegulations Relating to the Activities Speciﬁed in Title Three of the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law (Reglamento de lasaetividades a que se reﬁere e1 Titulo Tercero de la Ley de Hidrocarburos)‘ The power generation business is subject toregulation under the Mexican Electricity Industry Law (Ley de la Industria Electrica) and the Regulations Under theLaw for the Electricity Industry (Reglamento de la Ley de la Industria Ele’ctrica), except for “grandfathered” projects,which remain governed by the Mexican Public Electricity Service Law (Ley del Servicio Pﬁblico de Energia Electrica)and the regulations issued thereunder to the extent they do not conﬂict with the new legal framework However, giventhe recent creation of this legal framework, it is uncertain how it would be interpreted in practice, The Company alsocannot predict the manner in which the new legal framework would affect any new business opportunities the Companymay wish to pursue. See “Regulatory, Permits and Environmental Matters.” For example, since the publication of theconstitutional amendments relating to the Mexican energy sector in December 2013, a number of Mexican authoritiesand government-related entities have published in the Mexican Ofﬁcial Gazette more than 100 laws, regulations,resolutions, wles, notices and other provisions relating to hydrocarbons, and more than 50 relating to electric power,the vast majority of which are intended to regulate the activities of participants in the Mexican energy sector‘
The changes introduced by the new legal framework may require the Company to obtain an amendment ofits existing permits or secure additional permits to operate the natural gas, LNG, LPG, ethane, reﬁned products or powergeneration facilities or render of services, take additional actions to secure the requisite rights-of-way for its projects,perform social impact assessments, orupon consultation with the competent authorities, obtain the consent of indigenouscommunities for the development of its projects. The Company cannot assure you it would be able to satisfy any newrequirement affecting the existing permits or rights-of-way, or to secure any additional permit, approval or right-of-way required under the new legal framework. If the Company fails to satisfy any such requirement or if it cannot obtainany such permit, approval or rightvof-way in a timely fashion, the Company may be unable to operate or may experiencedelays in the development, construction and operation of its energy infrastructure projects. Futthermore, any changein the operating and disclosure rules for the Mexican energy sector, or any cost increase associated with complyingwith any gas emissions reduction or social impact assessment obligations, or with obtaining the consent of indigenouscommunities for the development of new projects, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its Shares
Among other things, as a result of the amendment of the legal framework for the Mexican energy sector,Pemex and the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission ceased to be decentralized agencies of the Mexican governmentand became independent, govemment-owned operating companies with technical, operational and administrativeautonomy The new legal framework generally, and the provisions governing the budgets ofthese Mexican govemment-owned companies speciﬁcally, have not yet been the subject ofjudicial or administrative inteipretation and it is uncertainhow they would be interpreted in practice. See “Regulatory, Permits and Environmental Matters.”

2.19.1. Short-term and other long—term employee beneﬁts and statutory emplayeeproﬁt sharing ( “PT U ”)
A liability is recognized for beneﬁts accruing to employees in respect of wages and salaries, annualleave and sick leave in the period the related service is rendered at the undiscounted amount of thebeneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for that service.
Liabilities recognized in respect of shoit-term employee beneﬁts are measured at the undiscountedamount of the beneﬁts expected to be paid in exchange for the related service and are presented inother liabilities.
Liabilities recognized in respect of other long-term employee beneﬁts are measured at the presentvalue of the estimated ﬁxture cash outﬂows expected to be made by the Company in respect ofservieesprovided by employees up to the reporting date.
2.19.2. Statutory employeeproﬁt sharing
PTU is record ed in the results of the year in which it is incurred and is presented in operating expensesand cost ofsales line item in the Consolidated Statement ofProﬁt and Other Comprehensive Income,
As result 0fthe 2014 Income Tax Law, as ofDecember 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, PTU is detenninedbased on taxable income, according to Section I ofArIicle 9 of the that Lawt
2.20. Provisions
Provisions are recognized when the Company has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result ofa past event, it is probable that the Company will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimatecan be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognized as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the presentobligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and unceItainties surrounding theobligation. When a provision is measured using the cash ﬂows estimated to settle the present obligation, itscarrying amount is the present value of those cash ﬂows (when the effect of the time value of money ismaterial).
When some or all of the economic beneﬁts required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered froma third patty, a receivable is recognized as an asset if it is viItually cenain that reimbursement will be receivedand the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
2.21. Financialinstruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognized when the Company becomes a party to the contractualprovisions of the instrument.
F inancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directlyattributable to the acquisition or issue of ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities (other than ﬁnancial assetsand ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt) are added to ordeducted from the fair value of the ﬁnancialassets or ﬁnancial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable tothe acquisition of ﬁnancial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss are recognizedimmediately in proﬁt.
2.21.1, Amortized cast
The amortized cost of a ﬁnancial asset or liability is the amount at which the ﬁnancial asset or liabilityis measured at initial recognition, minus principal repayments, plus or minus the cumulativeamortization using the effective interest method of any difference between the initial amountrecognized and the maturity amount, minus any reduction for impairment
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument orfinancial liability and of allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period.
31
===================================================
251.hocr: 
2. 22.
The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments(including all fees and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate,transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the expected life of the debt instrument,or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
2.21.2. Fair valueFair value is deﬁned in Note 2.2.b,Financial assets
Financial assets are classiﬁed into the following categories: ﬁnancial assets 'at fair value through proﬁt orloss' (“FVTPL”), investments preserved at maturity ﬁnancial assets 'available for sale' (“AFS”) and 'loansand receivables'. The classiﬁcation depends on the nature and purpose of the ﬁnancial assets and is determinedat initial recognition. All purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets made routinely identiﬁed and removed basedon the trade date. Purchases or sales regularly are those purchases or sales of ﬁnancial assets that requiredelivery of assets within the time frame established by regulation or custom in that market.
2. 22. 1. Effective interest rate method
The effective intei'est method is a method of calculating the amortized cost of a debt instrument andof allocating the interest income or interest cost during the relevant period. The effective interest rateis the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts (including all fees and basis points paid orreceived that form an integral pan of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiumsor discounts) during the expected life of the debt instrument or, when appropriate, a shorter periodto the net canying amount on initial recognition.
2. 22.2, F [nancial assets at F VTPL
Financial assets are classiﬁed as at FVTPL when the ﬁnancial asset is either held for trading or it isdesignated as at FVTPL.
A financial asset is classiﬁed as held for trading if:
0 It has been acquired principally for the purpose of selling it in the near term; or
o On initial recognition it is part of a portfolio of identiﬁed ﬁnancial instruments that theCompany manages together and has a recent actual pattern of short-term proﬁt-taking; or
° It is a derivative that is not designated and effective as a hedging instrument.
A ﬁnancial asset other than a ﬁnancial asset held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL uponinitial recognition if, certain conditions are met. The Company has not designated any ﬁnancial assetsas at FVTPL.
Financial assets at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising 0n remeasurementrecognized in proﬁt or loss. The net gain or loss recognized in proﬁt or loss incorporates any dividendor interest earned on the ﬁnancial asset and is included in the cost of revenues and in other gains andlosses line items in the Consolidated Statements of Proﬁt. Fair value is detennined in the mannerdescribed in Note 2.2.b.
2. 22. 3. Held—to-maturiry investments
Held-to -maturity investments are non-d erivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable paymentsand ﬁxed maturity dates that the Company has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity,Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortized cost usingthe effective interest method less any impairment. The Company does not hold any held-to—maturityﬁnancial assets.

===================================================
252.hocr: 
2. 22. 4. Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non—derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or detenninable payments thatare not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables (including trade and other receivables andamounts due from unconsolidated afﬁliates) are measured at amortized co st using the effective interestmethod, less any impairment.
Interest income is recognized by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivableswhen the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
2. 22. 5. Impairment of ﬁnancial assets
Financial assets are subject to impairment tests at the end of each reporting period. It is consideredthat ﬁnancial assets are impaired when there is objective evidence that as a result of one or moreevents that occurred after the initial recognition of the ﬁnancial asset, the estimated ﬁxture cash ﬂowsof the ﬁnancial asset have been affected.
For all other ﬁnancial assets, objective evidence of impairment could include:
- Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculty of the issuer or counterparty;
° Non-payment of interest or principal;
- It is probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganization; or
0 The disappearance of an active market for that ﬁnancial asset because of ﬁnancial difﬁculties
The canying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all ﬁnancialassets, except for accounts receivable where the carrying amount is reduced through an account ofallowance for doubtful accounts. When a receivable is uncollectible, it is removed from the estimateSubsequent recoveries of amounts previously written offbecome claims a gainst the estimate. Changesin the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognized in the Consolidated Statement ofProﬁt.
When non-current assets and disposal groups are classiﬁed as held for sale, they are required to bemeasured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. The comparison ofcarrying amount and fair value less costs to sell is carried out at each repotting date while it continuesto meet the held for sale criteria. As described in Note 12, an impairment loss has been recognizedrelated to TDM in the Consolidated Statements of Proﬁt.
Fair value is an estimate of the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer aliability in an orderly tIansaction between market participants at the measurement date. Accordingly,a gain or loss could arise once an actual sale is completed.
2.22.6. Derecagnition ofﬁnancial assets
The Company derecognizes a ﬁnancial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows fromthe asset expire, or when it transfers the ﬁnancial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards ofownership of the asset to another entity. If the Company neither transfers nor retains substantiallyall the risks and rewards ofownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Companyrecognizes its retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay.If the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred ﬁnancialasset, the Company continues to recognize the ﬁnancial asset and also recognizes a collateralizedborrowing for the proceeds received.
If a ﬁnancial asset is derecognized, the difference between the book value of the asset and thecompensation received is recognized in the Consolidated Statements ofProﬁt.

F inancial liabilities are classiﬁed as at FVTPL when the ﬁnancial liability is either held fortrading or it is designated as at FVTPLl
A ﬁnancial liability is classiﬁed as held for trading if:
- It has been acquired mainly for the purpose of repurchasing it in the near term; or
- It is part of a ponfolio of identiﬁed ﬁnancial instruments that are managed togetherand for which there is evidence of a recent pattern of making proﬁts in the shortterm; or

The Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial instruments to reduce its exposure to risks. These instrumentsare negotiated with institutions ofreco gnized ﬁnancial strength and when tiadin g limits have been establishedfor each institution The Company’s policy is to carry out transactions with derivative ﬁnancial instrumentsfor the purpose ofoffsetting its exposure to such risks through risk management. Further details of derivativeﬁnancial instruments are disclosed in Note 24,
The Company recognizes all assets or liabilities that arise from transactions with derivative ﬁnancialinstruments at fair value on the Consolidated Statements of Financial Position, regardless of its intent forholding them.
Derivatives are initially recognized at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and aresubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period The resulting gain or loss isrecognized in proﬁt or loss in the same line as the hedged item affects proﬁt or loss for deﬁvatives that areeconomic hedges

2.25. Hedge accounting
The Company designates cextain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives andnon-derivative with respect to foreign currency risk, either as fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges, or hedgesof a net investment in a transaction foreign. The hedge of the foreign currency risk of a ﬁrm commitment isaccounted for as a cash ﬂow hedge,
For its hedging instruments, the Company documents the relationship between the hedging instrument andthe hedged item at the inception of the hedge relationship, along with its risk management objectives and itsstrategy for undertaking various hedge transactions, Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on anongoing basis, the Company documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsettingchanges in fair values or cash ﬂows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk‘
2.25‘ 1, Cashflow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify ascash ﬂow hedges is recognized in OCI and accumulated under the heading of cash ﬂow hedgingreserve. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognized immediately in proﬁt‘
Amounts previously recognized in 0C1 and accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to proﬁt in theyears when the hedged item is recognized in proﬁt, in the same line of the Consolidated Statementsof Proﬁt as the recognized hedged item. However, when the hedged forecast transaction results inthe recognition of a non-ﬁnaneial asset or a non-ﬁnancial liability, the gains and losses previouslyrecognized in 0C1 and accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the initialmeasurement of the cost of the non-ﬂnancial asset or non-ﬁnancial liabilityi

2. 252‘ Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges arerecognized in proﬁt immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset orliability that are attributable to the hedged risk. The change in the fair value of the hedging instrumentand the change in the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are recognized in the line of theproﬁt or loss consolidated statements of related to the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Company revokes the hedging relationship, when thehedging instrument expires or is sold, teiminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualiﬁes forhedge accounting The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged item arising ﬁomthe hedged risk is amortized to proﬁt or loss ﬂom that date.
TuxutiunIncome Tax expense represents the sum of the current and deferred tax2. 26. 1. Current taxCurrent income tax is recognized in the results of the year in which it is incurred.
2. 26‘ 2‘ Deferred taxes
Deferred tax is recognized on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities in the Consolidated Financial Statements and the conesponding tax bases used in thecomputation of taxable proﬁt. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognized for all taxabletemporary differences. DefeIred tax assets are generally recognized for all deductible temporarydifferences to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁts will be available against which thosedeductible temporary differences can be utilized. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are notrecognized if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition (other than in a businesscombination) of assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable proﬁt nor theaccounting proﬁt. In addition, deferred tax liabilities are not recognized if the temporary differencearises from the initial recognition of goodwill.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognized for taxable temporary differences associated with investmentsin subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where the Company is able tocontrol the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference willnot reverse inthe foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differencesassociated with such investments and interests are only recognized to the extent that it is probablethat there will be sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts against which to utilize the benefits of the temporarydifferences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end ofeach reponing period and reducedto the extent that it is no longer probable that sufﬁcient taxable proﬁts will be available to allow allor part ofthe asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax liabilities and assets are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the peiiodin which the liability is settled or the asset realized, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have beenenacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting yea]:
The measurement ofdeferred tax liabilities and assets reﬂects the tax consequences that would follow
from the manner in which the Company expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover orsettle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities

Current and deferred tax are recognized in proﬁt or loss, except when they relate to items that arerecognized in 0C1 or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax are also recognizedin OCI or directly in equity respectively Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initialaccounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the businesscombination.
226.4 Tax on a_vsets
The assets tax (“IMPAC”) expected to be recoverable is recorded as a tax credit and is presented inthe balance sheet in the deferred taxes line item.
2.27. Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable. Revenue is reduced forestimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Revenue is recognized to the extent that it is probable that the economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Companyand the revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue includes amounts receivable for goods and servicesprovided in the normal course of business, net of discounts, rebates; VAT.
2.27.1, Sale ofgoods
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognized when the goods are delivered and titles have passed,at which time all the following conditions are satisﬁed:
- The Company has transferred to the buyer the signiﬁcant risks and rights of ownership of thegoods;
- The Company retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usuallyassociated with ownership not effective control over the goods sold;
0 The amount of revenue can be measured reliably;
° It is probable that the economic beneﬁts associated with the transaction will ﬂow to theCompany; and,
° The costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be reliably measured.
The following revenue streams related to the sale of goods are recognized in accordance with theprevious accounting policy as disclosed in more detail below:
- Sales of natural gas and the related costs are recognized upon the transfer of title, whichcoincides with the physical delivery ofuatural gas to customers; and,- Power generation revenues are recognized when generated power is delivered.
227.2, Rendering Qfser‘vices
Revenue from service contracts to provide services is recognized by reference to the stage ofcompletion of the contract. The stage of completion of the contract is determined as follows:
0 Service fees included in the price of the products sold are recognized by reference to theproportion of the total cost of the service provided for the product sold; and,
0 Revenue from contracts is recognized based on the rates provided to the extent incurred inworking hours and direct costs.
The following revenue streams related to the rendering ofservices are recognized in accordance withthe previous accounting policy as disclosed in more detail below:
0 Storage and regasiﬁcation capacity are recognized based on reservation and usage fees underterminal capacity agreements and nitrogen inj ection service agreements;

° Revenues also include net realized gains and losses and the net change in the fair value ofunrealized gains and losses on derivative contracts for natural gas; and,
° Revenues and costs related to administrative and other services are recognized when suchservices are rendered according to the related service contracts.
2.27.3, Interest income
Interest income from a ﬁnancial asset is recognized when it is probable that the economic beneﬁtswill ﬂow to the Company and the amount of income can be measured reliably. Interest income isaccrued on a timely basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rateapplicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash rec eipts through the expectedlife of the financial asset to that asset's net carrying amount on initial recognition.
2.27.4, Rental incomeThe Company’s policy for recognition ofrevenue ﬁom ﬁnance leases is described in Note 29.1.2.28. Foreign currencies
The Company’s functional currency is the U.S. Dollar, except for ECO, PEI and SDGN in its Gas segment,and Fundacion IEnova in the corporate segment, which is the Mexican Peso.
In preparing the Consolidated F inane ial Statements ofeach individual subsidiary of the Company, transactionsin currencies other than the subsidiaries functional currency (U.S. Dollar or Mexican Peso) are recognizedat the rates of exchange prevailing at the dates of the transactions. At the end of each reporting period,monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items carried at fair value that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the ratesprevailing at the date when the fair value was determined. Non—mone’tary items that are measured in termsof historical cost in a foreign currency are not translated.
Exchange differences on monetary items are recognized in proﬁt or loss in the period in which they arise
except for:
- Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings relating to assets under construction forfuture productive use, which are included in the cost of those assets when they are regarded asan adjustment to interest costs on those foreign currency borrowings;
- Exchange differences on monetary items receivable from or payable to a foreign operation for
which settlement is neither planned nor likely to occur (therefore forming part of the netinvestment in the foreign operation), which are recognized initially in OCI and reclassiﬁed fromequity to proﬁt on repayment of the monetary items.
For the purposes of presenting Consolidated Financial Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Company’ssubsidiaries with Mexican peso functional currency are translated into U.S. Dollars (the Company’s reportingcurrency) using exchange rates prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Proﬁt amounts are translatedat the rate of the transaction date, unless there are signiﬁcant currency ﬂuctuations during the period, in whichcase the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions are used. Exchange differences arising, if any, arerecognized in other items of comprehensive income and accumulated in equity.
On the disposal of an operation with a Mexican Peso functional currency all of the exchange differencesaccumulated in equity related to the disposed operation that are attributable to the owners of the Companyare reclassiﬁed to proﬁt.

Cn'tical accounting judgments and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Company 's accounting policies, the management of the Company required to makejudgments,estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the Consolidated F inancial Statements.The estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors considered relevant, Actual resultscould differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates arerecognized in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of therevision and future periods if the revision affects both the current and future periods
3.]. Criticuljudgments in applying accountingpolicies
The following are the critical judgments, apart from those involving estimations (see Note 32 below), thatCompany’s management has made in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies and thathave the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts recognized in the Consolidated Financial Statements
3.1.1. Finance leases
Management has determined that certain arrangements should be accounted for as a finance lease as thepresent value of the minimum lease payments at inception date of the arrangement amounted tosubstantially all of the fair value of the compression station as of such date Details of the ﬁnance leaseasset are included in Note 8.
3.1.2. Regulatory accounting
Rate regulation is the setting, by regulatory bodies or governments of prices that can be charged tocustomers for services or products through regulations, oﬁen where a company has a monopoly ordominant market position that gives it signiﬁcant market powert
As of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, there is no explicit guidance under IFRS regarding whetherentities operating in rate—reg'ulated environments should recognize assets and liabilities arising from theeffects of rate regulation, Generally Accepted Accounting Principles in the US, (“U.S. GAAP”) providespeciﬁc guidance on this matter.
The IFRS Interpretations Committee (“IFRIC”) has previously cemented that the US. GAAPrecognition criteria pertaining to rate»regu1ated accounting are not consistent with IFRS, The IASB,issued IFRS 14, Regulatory deferral accounts on January 30, 2014, as a part ofits pmj ect on this matter,however, such standard is not applicable to the Company as it is not a ﬁrst-time adopter of IFRS‘ As aresult, the Company does not recognize rate-regulated assets or liabilities in its Consolidated FinancialStatements. Management will continue to monitor the status of future deliberations by the IASB andIFRIC as it relates to this matter and its potential impact on the Company’s Consolidated FinancialStatements.
3.1.3. Contingencies
The Company accrues losses for the estimated impacts of various matters, situations or circumstancesinvolving uncertain outcomes. For loss contingencies, the Company accrues for the loss if an event hasoccurred on or before the date of the Consolidated Statements of F inancial Position. The Company doesnot accrue contingencies that might result in gains The Company continuously assesses contingenciesfor litigation claims, environmental remediation and other events.
3.1,4. Own use exemption
IAS 39 contains a scope exemption ﬁom derivative accounting treatment for physical delivery contractsof a non—ﬁnancial item for an entity’s own use. The scope exemption is meant to apply to ordinaryphysical supply arrangements. However, the standard also seeks to identify contracts which are not usedfor operational purposes as derivative instmments. If a non—ﬁnancial item can be settled net either incash or another ﬁnancial instrlunent, or by exchange of ﬁnancial instruments, it must be accounted foras a ﬁnancial instrument
39
===================================================
259.hocr: 
There are various ways in which a contract can be settled net. Management applies judgment in assessingwhether, among others, past practices of net settling similar contracts or of taking delivery and sellingthe item within a shott period; or, the commodity is readily convenible to cash, would lead to netsettlement.
Management analyzes each of its physical delivery contracts of nonﬁnancial items for determining ifthey are within the own use exemption from derivative accounting treatment
315. Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
The Company evaluates if an arrangement that does not take the legal form of a lease but conveys aright to use an asset in return for a series of payments should be accounted for as a lease The Company’smanagement uses its judgment to detennine, whether, based on facts and circumstances existing at theinception of the contract, it is remote that parties other than the purchaser will take more than aninsigniﬁcant amount of the output of the related asset.
3.1.6, Classzﬁcation ofitsjoint arrangements
Interests in associates and the joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. They are initiallyrecognized at cost, which includes transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, the ConsolidatedF inancial Statements include the Group’s share of the proﬁts and OCI 0f equity-accounted investees,until the date on which signiﬁcant inﬂuence or joint control ceases.
Key sources afestimation uncertainty
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertaintyat the end of the reporting period that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carryingamounts of assets and liabilities presented in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Financial Position.
3.2.1‘ Estimated useful lives prroperty, plant and equipment
As described in Note 2.14., the Company reviews the estimated useful lives of property, plant andequipment at the end of each reporting period. Please refer to Note 14.1. for useful lives of property,plant and equipment.
3.2.2, Impairment aflong-lived assets (goodwill)
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated The value in use calculation requires the directorsto estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discountrate in order to calculate present value Where the actual future cash ﬂows are less than expected, amaterial impairment loss may arise. Impairment testing is performed on an annual basis.
3.2.3, Asset decammixsianing obligation
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the useful lives of the Company’s long-lived assetsis reviewed periodically and is based on estimates at the date of the Consolidated Statements ofFinancialPosition of the present value of future costs expected to be incurred when assets are retired from serviceas required by law or per its contractual obligations. The payment dates of total expected futuredecommissioning costs are unc eitain and dependent on the lives of the long—lived assets, but are currentlyanticipated to be between 25 to 50 years. The Company uses its long-term “borrowing cost” rate as thediscount rate for calculating its provision related to its decommissioning liabilities, which is the 30-yearborrowing cost for companies in its industry with similar credit ratings, as measured by Bloomberg
3.2.4 Valuation qfﬂnancial instruments (fair value measurement)The Company uses valuation techniques that include inputs that are based on observable market data to
estimate the fair value of certain types of ﬁnancial instruments. Please refer to Note 24. for detailedinformation about the key assumptions used in the determination of the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments,

The Company cannatpredict the impact that legal, regulatory and social respunses to climate change mayhave on its business.
A number oflegal and regilatory measures as well as social initiatives have been introduced both internationallyand in Mexico in an effort to reduce greenhouse gases and other carbon emissions. The Mexican Electricity IndustryLaw and its regulations impose an internal system aimed at encouraging the use Ofelectricity generated through cleanenergy sources while introducing negotiable clean energy certiﬁcates as well as other measures aimed at achievinggreenhouse gas reductions, which could result in additional costs in the Power Segment, and in turn could have amaterial adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the marketprice of its securities,
In 2017, at the 23rd Conference ofParties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change,or COP23, in Bonn, Germany, there was the addition of countries such as Nicaragua and the exit of the United StatesofAmeriea‘ Among the main topics that were included in the agenda were: (i) progress in the discussions to achievethe implementation of the Paris Agreement of 2020; (ii) the launch of the Alliance for a coal-free energy future ledby the United Kingdom and Canada and endorsed by countries such as Mexico, which highlighted that the use of coalas energy must disappear in the OECD countries and in the European Union by 2030, and in 2050 in the rest of thecountries; (iii) the need to strengthen climate ﬁnancing; and (iv) Canada, Mexico and the Climate Alliance, composedof 15 states of the United States, launched a new NorthAmerican Dialogue on Climate Leadership, from which measureswill be promoted to carry out the Mexican proposals on the adaptation and development of early warning systems, aswell as commitments to reduce emissions of short—lived pollutants, which Mexico has already begun.
In order to comply with these agreements, Mexican regulatory authorities will seek to ensure that the Companyconducts its businesses in strict compliance with the Mexican Law on Climate Change, its regulations related to theNational Emissions Registry, the Mexican National Strategy on Climate Change (Estrategia Nacional de CambioClimdtico), the Mexican Special Program on Climate Change (ngmma Especial dc Cambio Climdtico) and theMexican National System on Climate Change (Sistema Nacional de Cambia Clima’tica), Accordingly, the Companywill be required to assume and take into increased consideration the climate-related challenges posed by its operationsor facing the existing partners and customers, such as Pemex and the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission, whichcould force it to incur in additional costs and could have a material adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancial condition,results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
The Company may be exposed to high costs to acquire LNG in order to maintain the operations of its LNGterminal.
In order for the LNG terminal to be operational, to prevent equipment damage from thermal expansion orcontraction during warming and subsequent re-cooling, and to provide service when needed by customers, the storagetanks and piping must be kept at or below approximately -l60° Celsius by maintaining a minimum volume ofLNG inthe system. That need will be met if one or more of the customers maintain a sufﬁcient amount ofLNG in the Company’sterminal However, other than the subsidiary customer IEnova Marketing, which has agreed to use reasonable effortsto procure LNG for its terminal at the Company’s request, none of the customers has an obligation to deliver cargoesor maintain a minimum LNG inventory, and the Company cannot assure you that the customers will do so Of theterminal’s capacity holders, only IEnova Marketing has delivered LNG cargoes to the terminal. Based on the marketprice of LNG relative to the price of natural gas markets typically served using regasiﬁed LNG from the LNG terminal,the Company does not anticipate that third-party customers, Shell Mexico, at Shell, and Gazprom Mexico, or Gazprom,will deliver LNG t0 the terminal in the near future, and the Company does not anticipate that in the near future thesubsidiary IEnova Marketing will deliver more than the minimum quantities required to keep the terminal cold,
In the event that the Company’s LNG terminal customers were not maintaining the necessary minimum volumeof LNG in the terminal, the Company would need to secure LNG in the market in order to maintain the cold temperatureof the terminal. If the cost to secure such volumes were to exceed the Mexican natural gas market price for which theCompany could resell the regasiﬁed LNG, it could be subject to ﬁnancial losses In addition, if the quality of LNG thatis delivered to the terminal is different from historical quality, or if the natural gas speciﬁcations in the United Statesor Mexico become more restrictive, the Company may need more LNG to keep the terminal cold than the Company

The Company believes that the chosen valuation techniques and assumptions used are appropriate indetermining the fair value of ﬁnancial instruments.
325. Allowancefor doubtful accounts
The methodology for determining the allowance for doubtﬁil accounts on trade and other receivables isset out in Note 5. The estimates and assumptions used to determine the allowance are reviewedperiodically. Although the provisions recognized are considered appropriate, changes in economicconditions could lead to changes in the allowance and, therefore, impact proﬁt.
3.2.6. Recovembility ofdeferred tax assets
As mentioned in Note 25., the Company has accumulated tax loss carryforwaxd beneﬁts, for which anevaluation of recoverability is performed on an annual basis,
The use of estimates and assumptions are particularly important in the recognition of deferred incometax assets.
3.2. 7. Measurement of deﬁned beneﬁt obligations: key actuarial assumptions
As described in Note 17., the Company uses actuarial valuations that include inputs that are based onpublished statistic and mortality tables. The Company believes that the chosen valuation techniques andassumptions used are appropriate in determining the beneﬁt obligations.
3.2.8. Key sources ofestimation uncertaintyfor [Enova PipelinesSelected Valuation Methodology.
IEnova Pipelines is a regulated business that will earn a return of its costs and a reasonable return on itsinvested capital, without other consideration; the value of the assets of a regulated business is the valueof its invested capital. Under this premise, the FV of the ﬁxed assets ofregulated businesses is equivalentto canying value for ﬁnancial repotting purposes, as canying value reﬂects the basis for which investedcapital is derived, and for which a regulated business is allowed to earn a reasonable return.
The Company concluded that the carrying value of the ﬁxed assets is deemed to be representative of F Vfor IFRS purposes.
3.2.9. Key sources ofestimation uncertainlyfor VentikaSelected Valuation Methodology.
Based on the nature of the power facility and generally accepted industry practice, the Company reliedon the Income Approach, speciﬁcally the Discounted Cash Flow (“DCF”) method.
Associated intangibles such as rights ofway / easements are embedded in the value of the propelty plantand equipment.
While the Cost Approach was not relied upon to derive the fair value estimate, provided the IncomeApproach being the preferred approach to valuing an operational wind power facility, it was consideredfor corroboratory purposes in relation to the fair value estimate derived utilizing the Income Approach,It is noted that the derived fair value estimate embeds a developer margin (i.e., margin above the costto develop/ construct the power project) that is within the reasonable range of developer margins expectedfor this type of power facility and at the stage of development associated with Ventika (i.e., recentlyentering commercial operation),
In addition to what is described above, the Company used different estimates relating to operatingstatistics, revenues, operating expenses and cash ﬂow items.

The Company is assessing the possibility of adding liquefaction capabilities to the LNG terminal, but itseffurts to such end may prove unsuccessful. In addition, the successful addition ofsuch capabilities couldforce itto terminate the existing agreements with the regasification customers, which could give rise to indemnificationobligations to such customers.
The Company is assessing the possibility of adding liquefaction capabilities to the LNG terminal. In the ﬁrstquarter 0f2015, the Company, Sempra Energy and a Pemex afﬁliate entered into several cooperation and coordinationagreements for the development of natural gas liquefaction facilities at LNG terminal The Company’s LNG terminalis the subject of certain disputes challenging the issuance of the construction and operation permits and authorizationsfor its LNG terminal, or LNG terminal permits, which may hinder its ability to secure ﬁnancing for the project or toidentify suitable partners and customers, In addition, because the Mexican permitting process and US. regulations forthe delivery of natural gas to LNG facilities located in Mexico are still under development, the Company cannot assureyou that the Company would not face signiﬁcant challenges in securing the requisite construction permits or buildingthe relevant facilities, and any such challenge could hinder its ability to secure adequate ﬁnancing or to identify suitablebanners and customers for this project, In addition, the development of the proposed liquefaction project will dependto a large extent on the condition of the global markets for LNG, including, in particular, as it relates to the supply anddemand for LNG from the west coast 0ftheAmericas (also taking into consideration the recent expansion of the PanamaCanal), and on the Company’s ability to obtain adequate supply or storage Ofnatural gas from the United States Thereare a number of potential LNG liquefaction projects under construction or in the process ofbeing developed by variousaroject developers in North America, including the Company's indirect, controlling shareholder’s contemplated neworojects, and given the projected global demand for LNG, the vast majorityofthese projects like ly will not be completed.In addition, an extended decline in current and forward projections of crude oil could reduce the demand for naturalgas in some sectors and cause a corresponding reduction in projected global demand for LNG, which could, in turn,result in increased competition among developers of LNG projects, The Company’s LNG terminal has in place severaloroﬁtable long-term regasiﬁcation agreements that account for 100% of the terminal’s installed capacity. Any decisionon whether to add liquefaction capabilities to the terminal will depend in part on whether the investment in theconstruction of the requisite facilities would be more proﬁtable than the continuing provision of only regasiﬁcationservices, under the existing agreements. Pursuant to the Company’s existing agreements, the Company is required toorovide storage and regasification services to its customers through 2028 (or later, if customers exercise their renewalrights under such agreements) The Company may opt for offering both regasiﬁcation and liquefaction, or onlyiquefaction services to its customers, or for continuing to provide regasiﬁcation services only. Ifthe Company is unableto continue to offer regasiﬁeation services to its existing customers, or if the constmction 0f the liquefaction facilitiesrenders it unable to provide such services on a timely fashion, the Company may be held liable for indemniﬁcation tosuch customers under the existing agreements, which could have a material adverse effect on its business, ﬁnancialcondition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.

The Company has relied on and may continue to rely on certain aﬂiliatesfor services and ﬁnancing andthere can be no assurance that in the future the Compan y will be able to obtain such services or ﬁnancing from itsaffiliates or from alternate thirdparties.
The Company relies on certain of its afﬁliates to provide various technical, administrative and managementservices, and expects to continue to do so in the future The Company depends to a certain extent on these afﬁliates forthe successful operation and development of its energy infrastructure projects The Company has agreements in placepursuant to which these services are being rendered, as more fully described in “Related Party Transactions and Conﬂictsof Interest” However, there is no obligation on the part ofthese afﬁliates to provide these services upon the expirationof the existing agreements, While the Company intends to continue to rely on afﬁliates for these services, the Companymay not be able to obtain such services from these afﬁliates or any alternate third party in the future at reasonable pricesor at all, Any failure to obtain these key technical, administrative and management services on acceptable terms couldmaterially adversely affect the Company’s ability to satisfy its contractual obligations, or to grow its business, and have

This acquisition increases IEnova's ownershipinterest in TAG from 25 percent to 50 percent, IEnova Pipelines previously accounted for its 50 percentinterest in DEN as an equity method investment. In November, 2017, DEN became a wholly owned,consolidated subsidiary of Emma. DEN will continue to account for its interest in TAG as on equitymethod investment.
This transaction was accounted as an asset acquisition because DEN does not meet the deﬁnition of abusiness, since it does not have substantive inputs or processes. DEN’s most signiﬁcant asset is its equitymethod investment in TAG, the entity that owns the Los Ramones Norte pipeline, The excessconsideration over the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated on a relative
fair value basis between the equity investment in TAG and an acquired intangible asset (Please refer toNote 15).

Management expects the IEnova Pipelines acquisition to have strategic beneﬁts, including opportunities forexpansion into other infrastructure projects and larger platform and presence in Mexico to participate in energysector. As such, IEnova Pipelines goodwill is tested at the Company’s Cash Generated Unit (CGU), IEnovaPipelines,
The Company used DCF analysis to detelmine the fair value of the CGU, The DCF includes cash ﬂows throughcontracted period of the pipelines and the gas storage terminal exit multiple of 4.3x. The discount rate utsedwas the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) calculated in 72 percent, Under this approach, the valuein use was greater to the carrying value. Based on that no impairment was determined.
Ventika
There are no signiﬁcant changes in Ventika’s operations that would indicate potential impairment sinceacquisition, including the following: a) its ﬁnancial results have been consistent with management initialprojections, 13) there has not been a material change in macroeconomic indicators, and 0) there have been nosigniﬁcant changes in workforce, strategy, market trends or impacts due to recent acquisitions/integrations1
In the case OfVentika, the Company considered appropriate to use cash ﬂows from the acquisition model andreviewed consistency with the actual results in 2017. The discount rate used was the WACC of 10.1percent. Under this approach, the value in use is greater to the carrying value, Based on that no impairment wasdetermined.
During the fourth quarter of 2017, the Company received additional infonnation regarding Ventika’s deferredincome taxes as of the acquisition date, primarily related to net operating loss carryforwards, As a result, theCompany recorded a measurement period adjustment that resulted in a net decrease to goodwill of$13.7 million.(Please refer to Note 11.23.),

Goodwill has been allocated for impairment testing purposes to IEnova Gasoductos Mexico’s cash-generatingunit, which is included in the Gas segment.
The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit is determined based on a lO-year DCF analysis of IEnovaGasoductos Mexico’s proj ected results, The DCF for 2017, 2016 and 2015, was calculated based on a long-tennunlevered cash ﬂow forecast using a discount rate of 9 percent, which was the same rate used at the acquisitiondate,

There are no signiﬁcant changes in IEnova Gasoductos Mexico’s operations that would indicate potentialimpairment since acquisition, including the following: 3) its ﬁnancial results have been consistent withmanagement’s initial projections, b) the changes on the macroeconomic indicators may have not had adverseeffect on the Company’s operations (Le. risk free rates are unchanged or lower than acquisition date and thechange of Sovereign average rating from BBB to BBB+ for Mexico), 0) changes in the regulatory environmenthave not had adverse effect on the Company’s operations and, d) there have been no signiﬁcant changes inworkforce, strategy, market trends or impacts due to recent acquisitions/integrations.
Although, the Company’s management believes the current discount rate may be lower as market rates havedeclined since the acquisition, the discount rate used as of the acquisition date was deemed to be a reasonable

Market risk
Market risk is the risk of erosion of the Company’s cash ﬂows, earnings, asset values and equitydue to adverse changes in market prices and interest and foreign currency rates.
The Company has policies governing its market risk management and trading activities. The Parent’ssenior ofﬁcers are members of committees that establish policies, oversee energy risk managementactivities, and monitor the results of trading and other activities to ensure compliance with theCompany’s stated energy risk management and trading policies These activities include, but arenot limited to, daily monitoring ofmarket positions that create credit, liquidity and market risk Therespective oversight organizations and committees are independent from the energy procurementdepartments,
The Company enters into a variety of derivative ﬁnancial instruments to manage its exposure tocommodity price, interest rate and foreign currency exchange rate risks, including:
- Interest rate swaps to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates or foreign currencies underwhich cenain liabilities are denominated (and its related tax impacts); and0 Commodity price contracts to hedge the volatility in the prices and basis Ofnatural gas.
There has been no material change to the Company’s exposure to market risks or the manner inwhich these risks are managed and measured.
Value at Risk (“VaR”) analysis
The VaR measure estimates the potential loss in pre-tax proﬁt, under normal market conditions,over a given holding period for a speciﬁed conﬁdence level, The VaR methodology is a statisticallydeﬁned, probability-based approach that takes into account market volatilities as well as riskdiversiﬁcation by recognizing offsetting positions and correlations between products and markets.Risks can be measured consistently across all markets and products, and risk measures can beaggregated to arrive at a single risk number,
Along with other tools, the Company uses VaR to measure its exposure to market risk primarilyassociated with commodity derivative instalments that the Company holds. The Company useshistorical volatilities and correlations between instruments and positions in the calculations.
The Company uses a one-day holding period and a 95 percent conﬁdence interval in its VaRcalculations. The one-day 95 percent VaR number reﬂects the 95 percent probability that the dailyloss Will not exceed the reported VaR
The variance-covariance approach was used to calculate the VaR valuesi
VaR History (95%, one day) As ofby risk type 12/31/17 12/31/16 12/31/15Interest rate swap $ 2,581 $ 4,025 $ 3,761Total VaR exposure 39 2,452 $ 3,824 S 3,573
VaR is a statistical estimate ofhow much a portfolio may lose in the given time horizon for the givenconﬁdence interval. By using a VaR with a 95 percent conﬁdence interval, the potential losses abovethat percentile are not considered; by using historical data possible adverse extreme movementsmight not be captured, since these did not occur during the time period considered in the calculations;and there is no guarantee that the actual losses will not exceed the calculated VaR.
W'hile VaR captures the Company’s daily exposure to commodity and interest rate risk, sensitivityanalysis evaluates the impact ofa reasonably possible change in commodity prices and interest ratesover a year. Details of sensitivity analysis for foreign currency risk are set out in Note 24.7.1.

Interest rate risk management
In September 2005, the Company entered into derivative transactions to hedge future interestpayments associated with forecasted borrowings of $450.0 million from third parties for ECA, whichwere designated as cash ﬂow hedges, In 2007, the original hedged items became probable of notoccurring due to a Change in the Company’s external borrowing needs. Accordingly, a cash ﬂowhedge gain of $300 million was reclassiﬁed ﬁom OCI in members’ equity to current earnings, andChanges in the fair value of these instruments were recognized in current earnings prospectivelywithin other gains and losses line item. As of December 31, 2014, there was one remaining interest-rate swap agreement with a notional amount of $1512 million under which IEnova received avariable interest rate (three-month LIBOR) and paid a ﬁxed interest rate of 5 percent.
The original terms of the swap expire on December 15, 2027. On September 16, 2015, the Company,through an early termination clause, made a prepayment in the amount of $298 million and as aresult, such derivative was cancelled. The one—year VaR information related to the interest rate swapis included in Note 24.51
248,], Interest rate swaps contracts entered into by the Company‘sjoint ventures
As described in Note 10121b1 the joint venture with InterGen entered into a swap contractthat effectively hedges the interest rate risk due to variable rate ﬁnancings.
As described in Note 10.5.b. the joint venture with Pemex TRI entered into swap contractthat effectively hedges the interest rate risk due to variable rate ﬁnancingst
The fair value ofderivative instruments is based on the market values in place as of the dateof the Consolidated Financial Statements, which impacts investment in joint venture witha debit to current earnings,
The Company’s management considers the results of the sensitivity analysis for thesederivatives to be inmaterial.
Credit risk management
Credit risk is the risk of loss that would be incurred as a result ofnonperformanee 0f the Company’scounterpanies contractual obligations The Company monitors credit risk through a eredit-approvalprocess and the assignment and monitoring of credit limits. The Company establishes these creditlimits based on risk and return considerations under terms customary for the industry
As with market risk, the Company has policies and procedures to manage credit risk, which aretailored for each business segment, administered by each subsidiary’s respective departments andoverseen by their management
In ECO, depending on the type of service requested by the customer, different criteria are appliedas follows:
Minor customers (residential customers for household consumption):
- Copy of ofﬁcial identiﬁcation;
- Proof ofresidence or power of attorney from landlord, in case ofrental residences;- Personal references, (which are conﬁrmed); and,
- Registration with tax agency for commercial customers with minor consumption

Major customers (customers for industrial and commercial consumption):
- Power of attomey;
- Legal representative ofﬁcial identiﬁcation;
- Copy of articles of incorporation;
- Proof of address; and,
‘ Depending on consumption volume, a guarantee is required, which could include letterof credit, cash deposit, or promissory notes among others
The oversight includes a monthly review of 100 percent of the balances of major customers by thecredit and collection department, to make sure that payments are made on a timely manner and toensure that they are in compliance with the agreed terms of their contract,
The Company believes that it has allocated adequate reserves for counterparty’s nonperformance.
For all other entities of the Gas and Power segments, when the Company’s development projectsbecome operational, they rely signiﬁcantly on the ability of their suppliers to perform on long—texmagreements and on the ability to enforce contract terms in the event of nonperfomiance.
Also, the factors that the Company considers in evaluatin g a development proj ect include negotiatingcustomer and supplier agreements and, therefore, rely on these agreements for future performance.

GRO's management believes that the risk arising from its concentration of credit is mitigatedsince all customers pay on a monthly basis, otherwise service can be suspended until dueamounts are collected.
TGN provides transportation services mainly to one sole customen TGN's managementbelieves that a concentration of credit risk is mitigated since its customer pays on a monthlybasis, otherwise service can be suspended until due amounts are collected.
IEnova Marketing sells natural gas and provides transportation services to some customers.IEnova Marketing’s management believes that although a potential concentration of creditrisk is present, this risk is mitigated since one of its customers is a governmental entity andanother is a related party. Additionally, all customers pay on a monthly basis, otherwise servicecan be suspended until due amounts are collected.
ECA provides LNG storage and regasiﬁcation services to IEnova Marketing and two otherthird parties. ECA’s management believes that although a concentration of credit risk mayexist, this risk is mitigated based on the creditworthiness of its customers and the relatedpatty nature of one of its contractual arrangements.
GAP provides transpottation services mainly to a one sole customer. GAP's managementbelieves that its credit risk is mitigated since the customers is a governmental entity with highcredit rating and pays on a monthly basis.

- The fair value of ﬁnance lease receivables is determined by calculating the presentvalue of the minimum lease payments, including the contract extension period, usingthe discount rate that represents the Company’s internal rate of return on capitalinvestments.
0 The Company determined the fair value of its long-term debt using prices quoted onrecognized markets.
- For ﬁnancial liabilities other than long-tenn debt, the Company determined the fairvalue of its ﬁnancial liabilities carried at amortized cost by determining their presentvalue as of each period end. The risk ﬁee interest rate used to discount to presentvalue is adjusted to reﬂect the Company’s own credit risk.

Signiﬁcant assumptions used by the Company in determining the fair value of the followingﬁnancial assets and liabilities are set out below:
Finance lease receivables. The fair value of ﬁnance lease receivables is estimated to be399500 million, $995.1 million and $571 million as of December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015,respectively, using the risk-free interest rate adjusted to reﬂect the Company’s own creditrisk.
24111131Fair value measurements recognized in the Consolidated Statements of F immcial Poxitian
The Company applies recurring fair value measurements to certain assets and liabilities.Fair value is deﬁned in Note 2.2.1).
A fair value measurement reﬂects the assumptions market paxticipants would use in pricingan asset or liability based on the best available information These assumptions include therisk inherent in a particular valuation technique (such as a pricing model) and the risksinherent in the inputs to the model, Also, management considers the Company‘s creditstanding when measuring its liabilities at fair value.
The Company establishes a fair value hierarchy that prioritizes the inputs used to measurefair value The hierarchy gives the highest priority to unadjusted quoted prices in activemarkets for identical assets or liabilities (Level 1) and the lowest priority to unobservableinputs (Level 3),
The three levels of the fair value hierarchy are as follows:
- Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted)in active markets for identical assets or liabilities as of the reporting date. Activemarkets are those in which transactions for the asset or liability occur in sufﬁcientﬁequency and volume to provide pricing information on an ongoing basis;
0 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quotedprices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability as ofreporting date, either directly or indirectly
===================================================

2411.4. Commodities and other derivative positions
The Company enters into derivative ﬁnancial instrument agreements to hedge the volatilityof its income tax impact attributable to the ﬂuctuation of the Mexican Peso relative to theUS. Dollar. Certain monetary assets and liabilities of the Company are denominated inUS. Dollars (functional currency); however, they are remeasured in Mexican Pesosthroughout the year for Mexican tax purposes. The remeasurement of these assets andliabilities gives rise to foreign currency gains and losses for Mexican tax pmposes andimpacts the Mexican income tax liability,

Any expansion of the Company’s businesses will be capital-intensive and require signiﬁcant investments Theamount and timing of the capital investments and expenditures for any new energy infrastructure projects will dependin part on market conditions‘ The Company may not be able to accurately predict the timing or amount of capitalinvestment and expenditures that would be required for its new projects.
To the extent that the Company does not have sufﬁcient internal resources available to fund new projects, theCompany may be required to access external resources, which may be subject to certain limitations on the availabilityof credit and/or other ﬁnancial alternatives and increases in interest rates or credit spreads In difﬁcult credit markets,the Company may ﬁnd it necessary to fund its operations and capital expenditures at a higher cost or on other termsthat are unfavorable to us, or the Company may be unable to raise as much funding as it needs to support businessactivities‘ This could cause the Company to reduce capital expenditures and could increase the Company’s cost offunding, both of which could reduce the Company’s short-term and long-term proﬁtability, which could have a materialadverse effect on the Company's business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or themarket price of its securities,
When the Company enters into ﬁxed—price long-term contracts to provide services or commodities, theCompany is exposed to inﬂation, interest rate, foreign exchange and counterparty credit risks.
The Company generally endeavors to secure long-tenn contracts with customers to optimize the use of theCompany’s facilities, reduce volatility in earnings and support the construction of new infrastructure However, if thesecontracts are at ﬁxed prices, the proﬁtability of the contract may be materially adversely affected by inﬂationarypressures (in the case of contracts that are not adjusted for inﬂation), including rising operational costs and commodityprices, fuel costs, costs of labor, materials and equipment, rising interest rates affect ﬁnancing costs, and changes inthe US, Dollar to Mexican peso exchange rate, In addition, the counterparties t0 the Company’s long-term contractscould incur in default with their obligations thereunder and any such default could have a material adverse effect onthe Company While the Company frequently requires that counterparties provide it with bank or other types ofguaranties, the ﬁnancial support provided by the guarantors is not always sufﬁcient to fully offset any losses the Companymay suffer and exposes it to counterparty risks, Anyofthese factors may have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities

In March 2010, the TFJFA issued a judgmentdeclaring null and void the ruling whereby the SCT dismissed the motion for review and orderingthe latter to admit such motion.

Motionfor review against MIA ofECA '3 Terminal. ﬁled by Inmuebler Baja Pacifier). SA. de C V(IBP) In 2006, IBP started an action / “popular claim” before the F ederal Attorney GeneralOfﬁce of Environmental Protection (Procuraduria F ederal de Pmteccion a1 Ambiente,”PROFEPA ) arguing that the conditions and relief measures set forth in the authorization ofenvironmental impact would be insufﬁcient and that the operation ofECA’s Terminal would causea damage to the environment, seeking, among others, the order to amend or annul the referredAuthorization in the Subject of Enviromnental Impact. The proceedings ended in 2006 in favorof ECA. IBP ﬁled a motion for review against such ruling, resolving it grounded and ordering theissuance of a new resolution assessing the evidence of IBP and resolving on the compliance ofthe environmental legislation
In compliance to the rulings in the motion for review, PROFEPA performed inspections on ECA’sTerminal and it determined that its operations comply with the determinants and relief measuresimposed in the authorization in the subject of environmental impact and they do not cause damageto the environment Such resolution was challenged by IBP through the proceeding for annulment(juicio de nulidad) before the Federal Court of Tax and Administrative Justice (“TFJFA”), whichin August 2013 declared the nullity of the challenged resolution considering that the authority didnot ground duly its territorial competence and it ordered PROFEPA to issue a new resolutionconsidering the evidence delivered by IBP setting forth why they would be insufﬁcient to provethe breach of the applicable legislation Against TFJFA’s ruling, both IPB and ECA ﬁledconstitutional trials, respectively, which were resolved in F ebruary 2015 determining to dismissthe constitutional claim brought by IPB and grant protection to ECA under the consideration thatIBP lacks of standi/legal interest to Challenge through proceeding for annulment the resolutionof the popular claim, ordering the TIFFA the issuance of a new resolution in congruence.

On June 17, 2010, the District Court issued aninterim judgment ordering the different authorities to suspend ECA’s permits, but suchprovisional order was revoked by the Circuit Court on June 24, 2010 before the governmentalauthorities answered. Each one of the governmental authorities named in the constitutionalclaim denied the charges and afﬁrmed the validity of their respective permits andauthorizations. The allegations hearing of Sanchez Ritchie has been adjourned due to theﬁling of many remedies and other procedural actsi In May 2012, the case was submitted tothe Collegiate District Court of Tijuana and an issuance date of the interim judgment regardingthe admissibility of the constitutional claim has not been set. The Company deems that theclaims of Sanchez Ritchie are unfounded
The constitutional hearing in the issue was held on December 8, 2014.
On February 16, 2015, the Third District Court in the subject of constitutional trial and federaltrials in the State of Baja California issued a resolution whereby it dismissed the constitutionaltrial.

Municipal claimﬁled by Sanchez Ritchie. In February 2011, Sanchez Ritchie ﬁled a complaintbefore the Directorate ofUrban Control (Direccion de Control Urbano, DCU) of the Municipalityof Ensenada, in Baja California, Mexico, arguing the invalidity of the zoning and constructionpermits granted to ECA’s Terminal in 2003 and 2004, respectively Although the Municipalityhad ratiﬁed the validity of the permits in its answer to the constitutional claim of Sanchez Ritchiedescribed above, shortly after receiving the complaint, the DCU issued an order of temporaryclosing and immediate cessation of operations. The actions of the authorities of the state andfederal government prevented the interruption of the operations of the terminal, while ECA ﬁledan answer to the administrative complaint before the DCU as well as a constitutional claim beforethe Collegiate District Court in Ensenadal In March 20 l 1 , the District Court granted the suspensionof the closing order until the resolution of ECA’s constitutional claim, which was conﬁrmed bythe Collegiate Circuit Courts in Mexicali As informed on April 28, 2014, on such date theMunicipality of Ensenada declared itself incompetent to deal with, transact, continue With thetransaction and, at the time, resolve the proceedings started in 2011 by Ramon Eugenio SanchezRitchie. Therein, the authority resolved to rescind the acts in the administrative proceedings,including the closing order, ordering to close the ﬁle as a fully and duly concluded issue. Thereferred memorandum was eventually challenged before an Administrative Court by SanchezRitchie, which was resolved favorably to the interests of ECA‘ The resolution mentioned abovewas not challenged because the issue was fully concluded and the judgment in favor of ECA is,in consequence, deﬁnitive.
Saloman Arya F urst andAbraham Hanono qufoul ﬁled before the Unitary Agrarian District Courtof Ensenada a claim against the Ministry of Agrarian Reform (Secretaria de la Reforma Agraria),ECA and other 20 defendants, The purpose of such claim is to procure a declaration of nullity ofthe property rights granted by the National Agrarian Registry regarding some plots ofland whereECA’s Terminal is located, as well as the return of another plot which allegedly is located in thesame place, based on the argument that the property titles issued in favor of the ECA’s formerowners were issued improperly and without considering the existing property rights of suchimmovable property. In September 2011 was held a deﬁnitive hearing on the subject, where theplaintiffs offered evidence to extend their claim. The judge did not admit the evidence, and beforeissuing the judgment, the plaintiffs ﬁled a constitutional claim against the refusal of the judge tothe admittance of the evidence. The action of the judge is suspended by the constitutional claim,and, the constitutional trial cannot continue until the Court serves notice of the civil claim to theother defendants, which has not happened. The Company deems that the claim is ungrounded.

In September 2006, ECA accused SanchezRitchie 0f the crime of dispossession for having trespassed ECA’s immovable property. As partof such proceedings, the public prosecutor issued a provisional order to remove Sanchez Ritchiefrom the immovable property, In the criminal complaints ﬁled in 2009, Sanchez Ritchie arguedthat ECA and the other defendants provided false information to obtain such order. The publicprosecutor responsible of the case determined that there was not enough evidence to prosecutethe defendants and closed the investigation; and in March 2011, the criminal court of Tijuanaratiﬁed the withdrawal of the action. In September 2011, Sanchez Ritchie ﬁled a constitutionalClaim against the respective ruling before the Collegiate District Court of Ensenada. The hearingto analyze the substantive aspects of the constitutional claim was held in March 2012 and in July2012 the judge granted the protection regarding the omission in the study, by the criminal judge,of certain evidence and arguments submitted by Sanchez Ritchie.

In August 2003, SEMARNAT dismissed such motion and in December 2003Inmuebles Vista Golf ﬁled before the TFJFA, in Mexico City, a proceeding for annulment againstthe respective ruling, In Apri12005 , the TFJFA issued a ruling declaring the nullity ofthe respectiveruling, therefore SEMARNAT continued the motion for review and in July 2006 resolved itconﬁrming the validity and legality of the authorization of environmental impact. In October2006, Inmuebles Vista Golf ﬁled before the TFJFA, in Mexico City, a proceeding for annulmentagainst SEMARNAT’s respective resolution.

In November 2011, Term Peninsular, A.C. (“TP”), an environmental organization, ﬁled beforethe TFIFA of Mexico City a motion for review against the resolution whereby SEMARNATgranted to ESJ the authorization of environmental impact for the construction and operation ofESJ wind farm. TP argues that it did not receive notice of such resolution; and that the MIA wasnot assessed pursuant to the applicable legislation, since otherwise, SEMARNAT would havedenied such authorization However, TP does not specify the laws or regulations that were notduly applied. Besides of the foregoing, TP argues that the different stages of the project shouldrequire independent authorizations; and that the granting of a conditional authorization for thedevelopment of future states which have not been fully defined is insufﬁcient to protect theenvironment. The TFJFA denied the suspension order requested by TR but admitted the claim.ESJ and SEMARNAT ﬁled their respective answers to the claim in June 2012, arguing that themotion ﬁled by TP is untimely and that the MIA was duly granted. The judge has admitted theexperts brought by the parties and ESJ’s and SEMARNAT’s experts have submitted their expertopinions. The request ﬁled by TP for the ﬁnal suspension was denied by the TFJFA, resolvingthat the evaluation from SEMARNAT was carried out under the applicable legislation.
Terra Peninsular fought that resolution through the corresponding appeal, which did not prosper,the refusal having been conﬁrmed. Due to the importance of the matter, it was referred to theSuperior Court of the TFJFA, which in a public session, unanimously by the votes of its judges,decided to dismiss the trial because it was promoted extemporaneously.

IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9, “F inancial Instrumentx” issued in July 2014, is the replacement of IAS 39 “F inancial Instruments:Recognition and Measurement”. This standard includes requirements for recognition and measurement,impairment, derecognition and general hedge accounting. This version supersedes all previous versionsand is mandatorily effective for periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early adoption beingpermitted. IFRS 9 (2014) does not replace the requirements for portfolio fair value hedge accounting forinterest rate risk since this face of the project was separated ﬁom the IFRS 9 project.
IFRS 9 (2014) is a complete standard that includes the requirements previously issued and the additionalamendments to introduce a new expected loss impairment model and limited changes to the classiﬁcationand measurement requirements for ﬁnancial assets. More speciﬁcally, the new impairment mod el is basedon expected credit losses rather than incurred losses, and will apply to debt instruments measured atamortized cost or Fair Value Through the Statement ofOther Comprehensive Income (FVTOCI), leasereceivables, contract assets and certain written loan commitments and ﬁnancial guarantee contracts.Regarding the new measurement category of FVTOCI, it Will apply for debt instruments held within abusiness model whose obj ective is achieved both by collecting contractual cash ﬂows and selling ﬁnancialassets.
With regards to the new IFRS 9 Financial Instruments, the three phases in the standard were evaluated:
I.— Classification and measurement: the new standard introduces a new model for the classiﬁcation ofall types of ﬁnancial assets, including those that contain implicit derivatives. With this model, the ﬁnancialassets are classiﬁed in their entirety, instead of being subject to complex bifurcation requirementsConcerning the classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial liabilities, the IFRS 9 keeps all of the current IAS 39requirements, the only change contemplated regarding the ﬁnancial liabilities is linked to recognizing thechanges in the own credit risk that is required to be presented as part of OCT.
The outcome of the evaluation of the following criteria will determine the way in which the ﬁnancialasset must be classiﬁed and, thus, the basis of its measurement subsequent to the classiﬁcation:
a) Determination of the Business Model
The Business Model refers to how the Company manages the ﬁnancial asset activities to generate cashﬂows that ﬂow directly to the Company either through the mere collection ofcontractual cash ﬂows, thesale of the ﬁnancial asset or through both activities
The determination of the Business Model is handled at a level that reﬂects how a ﬁnancial asset or groupof ﬁnancial assets are managed to meet a particular objective and not through an assessment ofindividualinstruments, and it does not depend on the intentions of Management on the ﬁnancial asset, but on itsactual use.
A company may have more than one Business Model to manage their ﬁnancial assets depending on thecharacteristics of the ﬁnancial asset and, above all, the use that the Management makes on that ﬁnancialasset to achieve its business goal.
In this regard, the Company is in the process of documenting its Business Model regarding the ﬁnancialassets that the Company has, and it does not expect to change its current classiﬁcation and, therefore, themeasurement of the corresponding ﬁnancial instruments.
b) Characteristics of the contractual cash ﬂows
IFRS 9 requires that contractual cash ﬂows represent only payments of the principal and interest, whosecharacteristics are consistent with those of a basic loan agreement in which the consideration of the timevalue ofmoney and those related to credit risk are the most important elements of the evaluation; however,if the contractual terms of the ﬁnancial asset include exposures to risk and volatilities in the contractualcash ﬂows that are not related to a basic loan agreement, cash ﬂows linked to such a ﬁnancial asset donot represent the principal and interest.
117
===================================================
337.hocr: 
Leverage may be a feature of contractual cash ﬂows in some ﬁnancial assets which increases the variabilityof cash ﬂows, resulting in different characteristics to those of interest.
The Company believes that the contractual cash ﬂows associated with its ﬁnancial instruments representmainly the recovery of the principal only, in some cases, and in others, only the principal and interest, asper the new standard; therefore, the Company has not identiﬁed possible effects associated with thiscriterion.
2.-Imgairment: This phase describes a three-stage model (overall model) for impairment based oncredit quality changes from the initial recognition.
a) Phase 1 includes the ﬁnancial instruments that have not had a signiﬁcant credit risk increase fromthe initial recognition or (at the company’s discretion) that have a low credit risk at the reporting date.For these assets, expected credit losses (ECL) are take into account at 12 months, and interest incomeis calculated on the gross book value of the asset amount (i.e., without deduction for impairment). The12-month ECL are those resulting from the default events that are possible within 12 months from thedate of the report. It is not the expected cash deﬁcit during the 12-month period, but the total credit lossof an asset, weighted by the probability that the loss occurs in the next 12 months.
b) Stage 2 includes ﬁnancial instruments that have had a signiﬁcant increase in the credit risk from theinitial recognition (unless they have a low credit risk at the reporting date and this is the option taken bythe company), but do not have objective evidence of impairment. For these assets, expected credit lossesare recognized for life, but the interest income is calculated on the gross book value of the asset amountThe ECL for life are those resulting from all the possible events ofnon-compliance during the maximumcontractual period in which the Company is exposed to the credit risk The ECL are the weighted averagecredit losses, with the respective risks ofa weighted default.
c) Phase 3 includes the ﬁnancial assets that have obj ective evidence of impairment at the repotting date.For these assets, the expected credit losses are recognized for life, and the interest income is calculatedon the net book value amount (Le. the net impainnent estimate).
At the date of issuance 0fthese ﬁnancial statements, the Company is in the phase 1 and according to theassessment carried out on its type oftransactions with the client, it was concluded that in its approach torisk assessment of clients there would be no signiﬁcant impact with the new requirements of the newstandard, and since the behavior of its clients has shown no risk indicators, the Company believes thatthe expected loss approach that the new standard sets will not result in a change in its estimates ofimpairment Even when this standard comes into effect on January 1, 2018 with retrospective application,the Company would apply this standard from January 1, 2018 because it turned out to be impractical tocarry out the assessment on a retrospective basis from the last reporting period.
3 Accounting (or Hedge : The IFRS 9 provides an accounting policy option which establishes that theentities may continue to apply the hedge accounting requirements in IAS 39, waiting for the end of themacro project risk coverage, or they may apply the IFRS 9‘ This choice of accounting policy will beapplied to the entire hedge accounting portfolio and cannot be perfonned on a hedge by hedge. In thisregard, the Company has chosen to continue using IAS 39.
This choice of accounting policy is applied only to the application of hedge accounting and has no impacton the implementation of the other two phases of IFRS 9, namely, ”Classiﬁcation and Measurement andImpainnent.
The new standard also introduces disclosure requirements and changes in the presentation, It is expectedto impact the nature and extent of the disclosures about ﬁnancial instruments, particularly in the year ofthe adoption of the new standard.
IFRS 15 Revenuefmm Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15, “Revenue from Contracts with Customers”, was issued in May 2014 and applies to animalreporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018, earlier application is permitted, Revenue isrecognized as control is passed, either over time or at a point in time.
118
===================================================
338.hocr: 
The standard outlines a single comprehensive model for entities to use in accounting for revenue arisingfrom contracts with customers and supersedes most current revenue recognition guidance, includingindustry speciﬁc guidance. In applying the revenue model to contracts within its scope, a company will:1) Identify the contract(s) with a customer; 2) Identify the perfonnance obligations in the contract; 3)Determine the transaction price; 4) Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in thecontract; 5) Recognize revenue when (or as) the company satisﬁes a performance obligation. Also, acompany needs to disclose sufﬁcient information to enable users of ﬁnancial statements to understandthe nature, amount, timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash ﬂows arising from contracts withcustomers.
Clariﬁcations t0 IFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
These clariﬁcations address (1) identifying performance obligations, (2) principal-versus-agentconsiderations, and (3) licensing. The amendments also provide some transition relief for modiﬁedcontracts and completed contracts. Speciﬁc provisions of the amendments include the following:Identifying performance obligations - Clariﬁcation that the objective of the assessment of a promise totransfer goods or services to a customer is to determine whether the nature of the promise, within thecontext of the contract, is to transfer each of those goods or services individually or, instead, to transfera combined item or items to which the promised goods or services are inputs. Principal-versus-agentconsiderations - Extension of the application guidance. Licensing - Clariﬁcation of whether an entity’spromise to grant a license of its IP should be recognized as revenue at a point in time or over time basedon whether the licensor’s ongoing activities signiﬁcantly affect the 1P. Transition relief - Two additional(optional) practical expedients. The amendments are effective for annual repotting periods beginning onor aﬁer January 1, 2018, whichis the same effective date as that ofIFRS 151 Earlier application is permitted
The Company has evaluated the recognition and measurement of revenue according to the ﬂve-step modelin the IFRS 15 and has not identiﬁed any signiﬁcant ﬁnancial impact, so that there will be no signiﬁcantadjustments after its adoption The Company chose to adopt the new standard as ofJanuary 1, 2018 byapplying the modiﬁed retrospective method of adoption. The Company has not adopted in advance anyinterpretation or amendment that has been issued but not yet effective.
Revenue ﬁ'om contracts with clients are classiﬁed along the following lines:
Revenue from tariff transportation servic es
Revenue from capacity services in pipelinesRevenue from storage services of natural and LP gasRevenue from distribution services ofnatural gasRevenue from administrative services
Revenue from generation ofwind energy
Revenue from sale of electric power
These revenues are obtained independently in contracts with each of its clients, with possible renewalsaccording to the contractual terms. Currently, the Company recognizes the income for services and forthe generation of wind energy and electric power when such services are rendered or when they aredelivered and accepted by the client, according to the programs established in the contracts. Accordingto IFRS 15, the allocation ofthese revenues will be made on the basis of independent sales prices as setout in the contracts and on the basis of What was incurred; therefore, the allocation of the considerationand, consequently, the timing of revenue recognition would not be affected by the adoption of IFRS 15.
On the other hand, the Company concluded that energy services and delivery are met over time, giventhat the client receives the beneﬁts provided by IEnova through the period in which the contract remainsin force, Consequently, according to IFRS 15, the Company would continue recognizing revenue fromservice contracts over time rather than at a point in time
Presentation and disclosure
The new presentation and disclosure requirements of IFRS 15 are more detailed than in the currentguidance, therefore, the Company concluded that this is a relevant change, because it signiﬁcantly

339.hocr: 
increases the volume of disclosures required in the Company's Consolidated Financial Statements.
Many of the disclosure requirements in IFRS 15 are new and IEnova has evaluated that the impact ofsome of these requirements will be signiﬁcant. In particular, IEnova hopes that the notes to the CondensedInterim Consolidated F inancial Statements will be extended due to the disclosure of signiﬁcantjudgment:when determining the price of transactions, how the transaction price is assigned to performanceobligations and the assumptions used in the estimation of independent sales prices of each performanceobligation During 2017, IEnova development tests in their systems to adapt them to the new IFRS 15requirements, as well as their internal control and accounting policies.
IFRIC 22 Interpretation of F areign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration
This new Interpretation clariﬁes the accounting for transactions that include the receipt or payment ofadvance consideration in a foreign currency. The interpretation is being issued to reduce diversity inpractice related to the exchange rate used when an entity repons transactions that are denominated in aforeign currency in accordance with IAS 21 in circumstances in which consideration is received or paidbefore the related asset, expense, or income is recognized
Effective for annual reporting periods beginning after January 1, 2018 with earlier application permitted.The Company is evaluating the new standard and no signiﬁcant ﬁnancial impact has been identiﬁed
Amendments to IAS 40 Transfers ofInvestment Property
These amendments to the guidance in IAS 40 on transfers ofproperty to or from investment property
Speciﬁcally, the amendments revise paragraph 57 of IAS 40 to state that “a company shall transfer aproperty to, or from, investment propeIty when, and only when, there is a change in use.” The amendmentsfurther clarify that a “change in use occurs when the property meets, or ceases to meet, the deﬁnition ofinvestment property” and that a “change in management’s intentions for the use of a property does notprovide evidence of a change in use.” The amendments are effective for periods beginning on or afterJanuary 1, 2018; early adoption is pennitted.
The Company is evaluating the new standard and no signiﬁcant ﬁnancial impact has been identiﬁed.
Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated ﬁnancial statements and IAS 28 Investment in Associates andJoin Venture
Amendments to IAS 28 require that gains and losses resulting ﬁom transactions between a company andits associate or joint venture relate only to assets that do not constitute a business As well, a newrequirement has been introduced that gains or losses from downstream transactions involving assets thatconstitute a business between a company and its associate or joint venture must be recognized in full inthe investor's ﬁnancial statements.
Additionally, a company needs to consider whether assets that are sold or contributed in separatetxansactions constitute a business and should be accounted for as a single transaction
On the other hand, for consolidated ﬁnancial statements, an exception from the general requirement offull gain or loss recognition has been introduced into IFRS 10 for the loss control of a subsidiary that doesnot contain a business in a transaction with an associate or a joint venture that is accounted for using theequity method.

Furthermore, there can be no assurance that, in the event of termination of anyof these agreements, the Company would be able to enter into LNG storage capacity or natural gas transportation serviceagreements with other users or customers on a long-term basis, on otherwise favorable terms, or at all, and the Company’ 5inability to do so could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
The Company depends on key suppliers, including an afﬁliate of its indirect controlling sharehalder, forthe adequate operation nfenergy infrastructure assets.
The Company’s businesses depend on key suppliers performing in accordance with their agreements, Inparticular, the Company’s LNG business has been relying upon Sempra Natural Gas (a business operating division ofSempra Energy that includes the Company’ 5 U, S, subsidiaries that sell LNG and buy and/or sell natural gas and electricityto and from Sempra Energy) for an adequate supply ofLNG to keep the Company’s LNG terminal sufficiently cold toremain in continuous operations and as a source of natural gas to sell to customers, Since the Company’s LNG terminalcommenced operations, the Company has not been able to obtain sufﬁcient quantities of LNG from Sempra NaturalGas to satisfy all of IEnova Marketing’s contractual obligations to its natural gas customers using regasiﬁed LNG,However, Sempra Natural Gas is able to purchase and supply the required quantities of gas at the US border, andSempra Natural Gas makes payments to IEnova Marketing to cover ﬁxed LNG terminal and pipeline capacity costs tothe extent its reserved capacity is underutilized because it provides IEnova Marketing less than the full amount ofLNGeach year, This payment obligation has mitigated the losses that lEnova Marketing would otherwise have experiencedin recent years With respect to the ECOGAS natural gas distribution business, since 2018 the Company has reliedprincipally on SoCalGas for the supply of natural gas that the Company distributes to its customers. If this key supplierfails to perform, the Company could incur substantial expenses, and in some cases, be exposed to commodity pricerisk and volatility, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsof operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The Company is also exposed to the risk that its suppliers that owe money or commodities as a result ofmarkettransactions or other long-temn agreements fail to perform their obligations under such agreements. Should they failto perform, the Company may be required to acquire alternative hedging arrangements or to honor underlyingcommitments by making purchases from other suppliers at then-current market prices. In such event, the Companymay incur additional losses to the extent of amounts paid to such suppliers, Furthermore, any ﬁnancial difﬁcultiessuffered by its suppliers could increase the Company's costs or adversely impact the operation of the energyinfrastructure The Company’s potential LNG suppliers may also be subject to international political and economicpressures and risks, which may affect the supply ofLNG.
The ﬁnancial condition ofany ofthe Company’s suppliers could be harmed by a number ofevents, includingnatural disasters, accidents or acts of terrorism, which could restrict the suppliers’ ability to fulﬁll their obligations tous. The payment terms in the Company's agreements with suppliers are considered customary in the markets in whichthe Company participates. However, a material change in the payment terms with the Company’s strategic supplierscould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash flows,prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The Company relies on transportation assets and services that the Company does not own or central todeliver electricity and natural gas.
The Company’s facilities are interconnected with other facilities outside the served areasi Therefore, theCompany often depends on electric transmission lines, natural gas pipelines and other transportation facilities owned
and operated by third parties to:
- Deliver the electricity, natural gas and LPG the Company sells to its customers;
- Supply natural gas to the Company’s electric generation facilities;

The IASB plans to redeliberate the effective date of the September 2014 amendments after it has completedits research project on the equity method. Early adoption of the September 2014 amendments continuesto be permitted
The Company is evaluating the new standard and no signiﬁcant ﬁnancial impact has been identiﬁed,
IFRS l6 Leases
IFRS 16 “Leases” was issued in January 2016 and supersedes IAS 17 “Leases” and related interpretations.The new standard brings most leases on-balance sheet for lessees under a single model, eliminating thedistinction between operating and ﬁnance leases. Lessor accounting, however, remains largely unchangedand the distinction between operating and ﬁnance leases is retained. IFRS 16 is effective for periodsbeginning on or after 1 January 2019, with earlier adoption permitted ifIFRS 15 'Revenue from Contractswith Customers' has also been applied.
Under IFRS 16 a lessee recognizes a right-of—use asset and a lease liability The right-of-use asset is treatedsimilarly to other ilon-ﬁnancial assets and depreciated accordingly and the liability accrues interest. Thiswill typically produce a front-loaded expense proﬁle (whereas operating leases under IAS 17 wouldtypically have had straight-line expenses) as an assumed linear depreciation of the right-of—use asset andthe decreasing interest on the liability will lead to an overall decrease of expense over the reporting period.
The lease liability is initially measured at the present value of the lease payments payable over the leaseterm, discounted at the rate implicit in the lease if that can be readily determined. If that rate cannot bereadily determined, the lessee shall use their incremental borrowing rate.
However, a lessee may elect to account for lease payments as an expense on a straight-line basis over thelease term for leases with a lease term of 12 months or less and containing no purchase options (thiselection is made by class of underlying asset); and leases where the underlying asset has a low value whennew, such as personal computers or small items ofofﬁce fumiture (this election can be made on a lease-by-lease basis).
IFRS 16 establishes different transitional provisions, including retrospective application or the modiﬁedretrospective application where the comparative period is not restated.
Regarding the transition methodology to be used, the Company will be using the modiﬁed retrospectivemethod.
Annual Impmvements to IFRSs 2014 - 2016 Cycle
The Annual Improvements include amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 which are not yet mandatorilyeffective for the Company. IFRS I deleted shoxt-term exemptions covering transition provisions of IFRS7, IAS 19 and IFRS 10 which are no longer relevant, Also the amendments clarify that the disclosurerequirements of IFRS 12 apply to interests in entities that are classiﬁed as held for sale, except for thesummarized ﬁnancial infonnation.
The amendments to IAS 28 clarify that the option for a venture capital organization and other similarentities to measure investments in associates and joint ventures at F VTPL is available separately for eachassociate or joint venture, and that election should be made at initial recognition of the associate or jointventure.
In respect of the option for an entity that is not an investment entity (IE) to retain the fair value measurementapplied by its associates and joint ventures that are IEs when applying the equity method, the amendmentsmake a similar clariﬁcation that this choice is available for each IE associate or IE joint venture. Theamendments apply retrospectively with earlier application permitted
Both the amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 28 are effective for aimual periods beginning on or after 1January 2018

IFRS 1 7 Insurance Contracts
IFRS 17 was issued in May 2017 as replacement of IFRS 4 Insurance Contracts. It requires a currentmeasurement model Where estimates are re-measured each reponing periodi Contracts are measured usingthe building blocks of: 1) discounted probability-weighted cash ﬂows, 2) an explicit risk adjustment, and3) a contractual service margin (“CSM”) representing the unearned proﬁt of the contract which isrecognized as revenue over the coverage period.
The standard allows a choice between recognizing changes in discount rates either in the income statementor directly in other comprehensive income. The choice is likely to reﬂect how insurers account for theirﬁnancial assets under IFRS 9.
An optional, simplified premium allocation approach is permitted for the liability for the remainingcoverage for short duration contracts, which are often written by non-life insurers.
There is a modiﬁcation of the general measurement model called the ‘Variable fee approach’ for certaincontracts written by life insurers where policyholders share in the returns from underlying items. Whenapplying, the variable fee approach the Company’s share of the fair value changes of the underlying itemsis included in the contractual service margin. The results of insurers using this model are therefore likelyto be less volatile than under the general model.
The new rules will affect the ﬁnancial statements and key performance indicators of all entities that issueinsurance contracts or investment contracts with discretionary participation features.
IFRS 17 is applied for annual reporting periods beginning on or after January 1, 2021. Earlier applicationis permitted for entities that apply IFRS 9 and IFRS 15 on or before the date of initial application of IFRS17.
The Company is in the process of evaluating the potential effects of implementing this new standard inits ﬁnancial information
IFRIC 23 Uncertainty aver Income Tax Treatments
This new Interpretation clariﬁes how to apply the recognition and measurement requirements in IAS 12“Income taxes” when there is uncenainty over income tax treatments. Uncertain tax treatments are a taxtreatment for which there is uncertainty over whether the relevant taxation authority will accept the taxtreatment under tax law. In such a circumstance, a company shall recognize and measure its current ordeferred tax asset or liability by applying the requirements in IAS 12 based on taxable proﬁt (tax loss),tax bases, unused tax losses, unused tax credits and tax rates determined applying this Interpretation.
A company shall apply IFRIC 23 for annual reponing periods beginning on or aﬁer January 1, 2019.Earlier application is permitted and the fact must be disclosed. On initial application, the Interpretationmust be applied retrospectively under the requirements of IAS 8 or retrospectively with the cumulativeeffect of initially applying the Interpretation as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings.
The Company's is in process of assessment ofpotential effects that could generate the implementation ofthese changes if any applicable

Description of the asset acquisition, the “Transaction”
On November 15, 2017,1Enova completed the acquisition to Pemex TransfonnacionIndustria1(“Pemex TRI”)ofthe 50 percent interest in Ductos y Energeticos del Norte S de R L, de C, V (“DEN”), a joint venture thatholds a 50 percent interest in the Los Ramones Norte pipeline, through TAG Norte Holdings S. de R. L‘ de C.V (“TAG), for a purchase price of$16418 million (exclusive of $172 million of cash and cash equivalentsacquired), plus the assumption of $95.8 millions of intercompany debt. This acquisition increases IEnova'sownership interest in TAG from 25 percent to 50 percent IEnova Pipelines previously accounted for its 50percent interest in DEN as an equity method investment. As of November 1, 2017, DEN became a wholly owned,consolidated subsidiary of Emma DEN will continue to account for its interest in TAG as on equity methodinvestment.
This transaction was accounted as an asset acquisition because DEN does not meet the deﬁnition of a business,since it does not have substantive inputs or proc esses. DEN’s most signiﬁc ant asset is its equity method investmentin TAG, the entity that owns the Los Ramones None pipeline. The excess consideration over the fair value ofassets acquired and liabilities assumed was allocated on a relative fair value basis between the equity investmentin TAG and an acquired intangible asset related to an Operation and Maintenance (“O&M”) contract with TAG.

- Provide retail energy services to customers; and
° Supply the Company with natural gas and LPG for sale to its customers
The Company also depends on natural gas pipelines to interconnect with its suppliers and customers, andrelies on specialized ships to transport LNG to its LNG terminal and on transmission lines to transport the electricitythat it sells to its customers If transportation is disrupted, or if capacity is inadequate, the Company’s ability to selland deliver its products and services may be hindered. As a result, the Company may be responsible for damagesincurred by its customers, such as the additional cost of acquiring alternative natural gas, LPG or electricity suppliesat then-current spot market rates, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancialcondition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
If the commodities shipped in the Company ’s pipelinesfail to meet certain specifications, it could result incurtailments by interconnecting pipelines or markets.
Mexican Ofﬁcial Standards (Normas Oﬁciales Mexicanas) establish speciﬁcations for the products that maybe delivered through natural gas, LPG and ethane pipelines. These speciﬁcations include requirements such ashydrocarbon dew point, compositions, temperature and foreign content (such as water, sulfur, carbon dioxide andhydrogen sulﬁde). If the total mix of products that the Company delivers to a pipeline or market fails to meet theapplicable product quality speciﬁcations set forth in the Mexican Ofﬁcial Standards, the Company is required to disclosesuch non-complianee to the producer and to the pipeline or market that scheduled the delivery. The pipeline or marketmay reﬁise to accept all or a part of the non-compliant products scheduled for delivery to it, potentially reducing theCompany's through-put volumes or revenues, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The Company does not own all of the land on which the Company’s pipelines, facilities and ancillaryinfrastructure are located, so its operations cauld be disrupted by actions 0/ the landowners. Some of the Company’spipelines cross waterways, in which case governmental approval from entities such as the Mexican National WaterCammission (Comisia'n Nacional del Agua) is required. Furthermore, delays or the impossibility of abtaining therelease of rights-af-wuy t0 the land, through which some of the Company’s energy projects currently underconstruction will be laid, may cause material cast increases and delays in the start afaperutiuns.
The Company does not own all of the land on which the Company’s pipelines, facilities and ancillaryinfrastructure, such as power transmission lines and aqueducts, have been constructed, Some of the Company’ s pipelinescross waterways, in which case governmental approval from entities such as the Mexican National Water Commissionis required to maintain such a crossing, The Company typically obtains the rights to construct and operate the Company’spipelines and ancillary infrastructure on land owned by third parties and governmental agencies for a speciﬁc period0ftime. The Company is therefore subject to the possibility of more onerous terms or increased costs to retain necessaryland use if in the future it is determined that the Company does not have valid rights-of-way or leases, or if such rights-of-way 0r leases lapse or terminate. The Company’s loss 0fthese rights, through the inability to renew right-of-way orlease contracts or otherwise, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The Company may face construction delays or increases in costs in the energy generation projects as a resultofdelays or the impossibility of obtaining rights-of-way to the land through which power transmission lines, pipelineinstallations or other infrastructure will be constructed. Moreover, power transmission line projects require the Mexicanfederal government, the permit holder, or both, to obtain legal authorizations to use third party land to construct andoperate a particular project. If rights-of-way are not obtained on time, the Company may incur additional costs anddelays in the start of operations Furthermore, in the event that rights-of—way are impossible to obtain, the Companymay be required to change the route of a project, which may also result in cost increases and delays in the start ofoperations and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations,cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.

The Company is exposed to market risks, includingﬂuctuutions in cammodityprices, which could have amaterial adverse eﬁ’ect 0n the Company ’3 business, ﬁnancial condition, results afaperatinns, cashﬂaws, prospectsand/ar the marketprice of its securities.
The Company buys energy-related commodities from time to time in order to satisfy contractual obligationswith customers. The Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or themarket price of its securities could be materially adversely affected if the prevailing market prices for electricity, naturalgas, LNG or other commodities that the Company buys change in a direction or manner not anticipated and for whichthe Company had not provided adequately through purchase or sale commitments or other hedging transactions Inaddition, while at present the Company is not directly exposed to market risks in connection with the ECOGAS naturalgas distribution business because the price the Company pays for natural gas is passed through to the ECOGAScustomers, natural gas prices relative to LPG prices affect the Company’s ability to sell natural gas, and accordingly,may have a material impact on the natural gas distribution business On January 1, 2012, the Company’s Termoeléctricade Mexicali power plant began selling electricity to the US market on a merchant basis pursuant to an electricitymanagement agreement with the afﬁliate, Sempra Generation Under this arrangement the Company is no longerreimbursed for its purchases ofnatural gas to fuel Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant as the Company was in prioryears and may also need to purchase electricity in the open market to satisfy contractual obligations. This arrangementexposes the Company to signiﬁcantly more commodity price risk than the previous agreement the Company had inplace to sell electricity from the power plant directly to the Company’s afﬁliate Sempra Generation Termoele'ctrica deMexicali power plant competes in the US. open market for the sale of electricity and other related products, and itsproﬁtability is affected by the price Ofcommodities such as natural gas and the prices for its products in the open market.Additionally, under this new agreement the Company’s annual costs of energy management services rose toapproximately USD$5.0 million in connection with Termoele'ctrica de Mexicali. Furthermore, the Company currentlypurchases natural gas to supply Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant directly from its subsidiary IEnova Marketing.Although the board ofdirectors has approved a plan to market and sell the Termoele’ctrica de Mexicali power plant, ifthe Company is unable to complete the sale ofthis plant, it will continue to be subject to commodity risk with respectto it,
The Company cannot and does not attempt tofully hedge its assets or contract positions against changesin commodity prices and the Cumpany ’s hedgingpmcedures may not work as planned.
To reduce ﬁnancial exposure related to commodity price ﬂuctuations, the Company may enter into contractsto hedge the Company’s known or anticipated purchase and sale commitments, inventories of LNG and natural gas,and electric generation capacity and pipeline capacity. As part of this strategy, the Company may use forward contracts,physical purchase and sales contracts, futures, ﬁnancial swaps and options, The Company does not hedge the entireexposure to market price volatility of its assets or contract positions, and the hedging will vary over time. To the extentthe Company has un—hedged positions, or if its hedging strategies do not work as planned, ﬂuctuating commodity pricescould have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows,prospects and/or the market price of its securities. When hedging its purchase and sale commitments, the Company issubject to the risk that the counterparty to the hedge may be unable to fulﬁll its obligations Such failure could have amaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash flows, prospectsand/or the market price of its securities
Unanticipated changes in market prices for energy—related commodities result from multiple factors, including:(1) weather conditions, (2) seasonality, (3) changes in supply and demand, (4) transmission or transportation constraintsor inefficiencies, (5) availability Ofcompetitively priced alternative energy sources, (6) commodity production levels,(7) activities by oil and gas producing nations or organizations affecting the global supply of crude oil and natural gas,(8) energy and environmental regulation legislation, (9) natural disasters, wars, embargoes and other catastrophic events,and ( l 0) expropriation ofassets by govemmental authorities. Finally, the Company often extends credit to counterpartiesand customers While the Company performs credit analysis prior to extending credit, the Company is exposed to therisk the Company may not be able to collect amounts owed to it. Such changes in market prices or inability to collectamounts owed to the Company could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition,results ofoperations, cash flows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.

Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—Quantitative and Qualitative Discussion of Market Risk andNotes 21 and 24 to the Company’s audited ﬁnancial statements included elsewhere in this report.
LPGprices cauld materially adversely affect the Ecogas natural gas distribution business.
Historically, LPG prices were subsidized by the Mexican federal government, Recently, however, the Mexicanfederal government has ended subsidizing LPG prices. If the Company is not able to obtain competitively priced naturalgas relative to the LPG that is available to its customers and potential customers through its competitors, the proﬁtabilityof the natural gas distribution business could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or themarket price of its securities.
The Mexican federal government’s electricity price subsidy policy could materially adversely affect theVentika electric energy distribution business.
Currently electricity prices are subsidized by the Mexican federal government; these electricity subsidies couldput Ventika power purchase agreements at a competitive disadvantage, If the Mexican federal govemment’s electricityprice subsidy policy continues and the Company is unable to provide electricity at prices that are competitive to thoseavailable to its customers and potential customers through its competitors, the proﬁtability of the Ventika wind powergeneration facilities could be materially adversely affected, which in turn could have a material adverse effect on theCompany’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of itssecurities
The Company’s risk managementprocedures may not prevent losses.
Although the Company has in place risk management systems and control systems that use advancedmethodologies to quantify and manage risk, these systems may not always prevent material losses. Risk managementprocedures may not always be followed or may not always work as planned‘ In addition, daily value-at—risk and losslimits are based on historic price movements, 1f prices signiﬁcantly 0r persistently deviate from historic prices, thelimits may not protect the Company from signiﬁcant losses As a result 0fthese and other factors, there is no assurancethat the Company's risk management procedures will prevent losses that could have a material adverse effect on theCompany’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of itssecurities.
The Company conducts a significant portion of the Company’s pipeline business through joint venturesover which it holdsjoint contra].
The Company has a 50% interest in a joint venture with TAG Pipelines (a Pemex afﬁliate) and BlackRock,for the Los Ramones None pipeline, which began commercial operations in February 2016, The Company has enteredinto a joint venture with InterGen for the operation of the Company’s Energia Sierra Juarez wind power generationproject, which began operations in June 2015, and a 40% non-controlling interest in the South ofTexas - Tuxpan pipelineproject, which the Company is developing with TransCanada, As the Company shares the control of these joint ventureswith its partners, and in the event of any disagreement between it and its partners the Company may be forced to sellits interest in the relevantjoint venture, purchase its panners' interests therein or submit to dispute resolution proceedings,If any joint venture partner were unwilling to cooperate effectively with the Company in the management and operationof the joint venture, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsof operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The operation 0f the Company’sfacilities depends 0n good labor relations with the Company’s employees.
As of December 31, 2017, the Company had 930 employees These included 151 administrative employeesand 779 operation and maintenance workers, of whom 35 were covered by collective bargaining agreements withseveral labor unions The Company’s collective bargaining agreements are negotiated on a facility-by-facility basis,and the compensation terms are adjusted on an annual basis, whereas all other terms are renegotiated every two years.

Translation of ﬁnancial statement:- affareign subsidiaries - To consolidate ﬁnancial statements offoreign subsidiaries, the accounting policies of the foreign entities are converted to MFRS using thecurrency in which transactions are recorded. The ﬁnancial statements are subsequently translated toMexican pesos using the following methodologies:
Foreign operations with a functional currency different from the local currency and the reportingcurrency translate their ﬁnancial statements from the currency in which transactions are recorded to theﬁxmtional currency, using the following exchange rates: 1) the closing exchange rate in effect at thebalance sheet date for monetary assets and liabilities; 2) historical exchange rates for non—monetaryassets and liabilities and anckholders’ equity; and 3) the rate on the date of accrual of revenues, costsand expenses, except those arising horn non-monetary items that are translated using the historicalexchange rate for the related non-monetary item. Translation effects are recorded undercomprehensive ﬁnancing (cost) income within results. Subsequently, t0 u-anslate the ﬁnancialstatements ﬁ’om the functional currency to Mexican pesos, the following exchange rates are used: 1)the closing exchange rate in eﬁ‘ect at the balance sheet date for assets and liabilities; 2) historicalexchange rates for stockholders‘ equity, and 3) the rate on the date of accrual ofrevenues, costs andexpenses. Translation effects are recorded in cumulative uanslation adjustment within members’
equity.
Comprehensive income - Comprehensive income represents changes in stockholders' equity duringthe year, for concepts other than capital contributions, reductions and distributions, and is comprised ofthe net income of the year, plus other comprehensive income (loss) items of the same peri ad, whichare presented directly in stockholders‘ equity without affecting results. Other comprehensive income(loss) is represented by the effects of the cumulative translation adjustments of foreign operations andthe valuation of derivative ﬁnancial instruments. Upon realization ofasscts and settlement of liabilitiesgiving rise to other comprehensive income items, the latter are recognized within results.

Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies
The accompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in conformity with MFRS, whichrequire that management make certain estimates and use certain assumptions that nﬁ'ect the amounts reportedin the ﬁnancial statements and their related disclosures; however, actual results may differ ﬁnm suchestimates. The Entity’s management, upon applying professionaljudgment, considers that estimm made andassumptions used were adequate under the circumstances. The signiﬁcant accounting policies of the Entity areas follows:
i. Accnunting clumgm -As of January 1, 2015, the Entity adopted the following improvements to NIF 2015:NIF’s that result in accounting changes:
NIF 13-8, Consolidated or Combined Financial StatementsBulletin C—9, Liabilities, Provisions, Contingent Aesets and Liabilities end Commitments
NII-s that do not result in accounting changes:
NIF B-l3, Events Subsequent to the Date of the Financial Statements and Bulletin 09,Liabilities, vaisions, Contingent Assets and Liabilities and Commitments
NH: 13-15, Conversion ofFureigu Currenciﬁ
NIF B-S, Consolidated or Combined F inancial Statements— Clariﬁes the criteria to be evaluatedin order tn identify an investment entity and indicates that given the nature of the primaryactivity of an investment entity, it may be diﬂicult for such an entity to exercise canto] over theentities in which it has invested; therefore, an analysis should be eurried out in order toconclude whether the entity exercises control over its investees.
Bulletin C-9, Liabilities, Provisions. Contingent Assets and Liabilities and Commitments—Clariﬁes and modiﬁes the accounting treatment for liabilities arising ﬁ'om customer advancesdenominated in foreign currency‘ When an entity receives advance collections for sales orservices denominated in foreign currency, the changes in exchange rates between the functionalcurrency and the transaction currency do not aﬁect the amount of the advance collection.Accordingly, the balance of the customer advances liability should not be modiﬁed as a resultof such changes in exchange rates.
NEF B-13, Events Subsequent to the Date of the Financial Statements and Bulletin (2-9,Liabilities, Provisions, Contingent Assets and Liabilities and Commitments ~NIF 3—13 includesin a footnote the disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements of an entity that are not prepared on agoing concern basis in accordance with NIF A-7, Presentation and Disclosure. Suchrequirement was included as part of the regulatory text in the disclosure standards section ofNI]: 13—13, and as part of BuIleﬁn O9 to disclose the contingencies arising from the fact that theentity is not operating on a going concern basis. Consequently, Circular 57 SuﬁcientDisclosure is repealed as a result of the Commercial Bankruptcy Law.
NIF B-15, Conversion of Foreign Currencies — The deﬁnition of foreign operations wasmodiﬁed to clarify that it not only refers to a legal entity or a cash generating unit whoseoperations are based on or carried out in an economic environment or currency diﬁ'erent fromthose of the reporting entity, but also includes legal entities or cash generating units that operatein the same country as the reporting entity {parent or holding company), but use a currencydiﬁerent ﬁ‘om that of the reporting entity.
At the date ofissuance ofthese consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the adoption of these improvementsdid not have a material eﬂ'eet on the Entity’s ﬁnancial infomation.
ii. Recognition afthe eﬂ'em ofinﬂatian — Cumulative inﬂation rates over the three-year periods endedDecember 31, 2015 and 2014 were 10.52% and 12.08%, in each period. Accordingly, the economicenvironment is not inﬂationary in either such year and no inﬂationary effects were recognized in theaccompanying consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Inﬂation rates for the years ended December 3 l.2015 and 2014 were 2.13% and 4.08%, respectively.

Cash and cash equivalenn' — Cash and cash equivalents consist mainly of bank deposits in checkingaccounts and daily investments easily convertible into cash, Cash is stated at nominal value and cashequivalents are valued at fair value; any fluctuations in value are recomized in comprehensiveﬁnancing (cost) income of the period. Cash equivalents are represented mainly for eesh in investmentﬁmds.
Immune!“ In share: afjalnl venture - Ajoint business is a contmcmal agreement in which the partiesthat hnvejoint wnu'ol over the amngement have the right to the net assets of the joint business. Jointcontrol is the contractual agreement to share canto] in a business, which exists when the decisionsregarding the relevant activities of the joint business require the unanimous approval of the parties whoshare control.
The investment in associated companies andjnint businesses is adjusted aﬂer the initial recognition forthe respective portion of comprehensive income or loss of the associated company as welI as for thedistribution of proﬁts or mpital reimbursements of such company. lfindicators ofimpairment arepment, the investments in associated companies andjoint businesses are subjected to impairment
testing.
Operation regulated - As mentioned in Note I, the activity of Gasoductos de Chihuahua end itssubsidiaries, GDT, TDF, TDN and GDN is regulated by the CRE. Consequently, and in accordancewith the provisions of NIF A—S, Supplementary nature, the Entity decided to apply residuallyCodiﬁcation ASC 980 Regulated Operations (fomterly FAS 71) (ASC 980) of the FinancialAccounting Standard Board (FASB) accounting principles generally accepted in the United States,whereby assets and liabilities resulting ﬁ'om the procss ofdetermining regulated rates, which wouldnot be recorded under ﬁnancial reporting standards applicable to operations are recorded unregulated.In determining rate: for CRE, considering the investment budget presented each of the Entities to thecontroller. The Entity periodically evaluates the applicability of ASC 980 and considers factors such aschanges in regulations and the impact of competition. if the cost-based regulation ends or competitionincreases, the Entity could punish their recorded based on this standard assets.
Aﬂawancefarfunds used during construction (AFUDC) - Based on ASC 980 above described. TheAFU'DC 11me the estimated proceeds ofdebt and equity needed to ﬁnance cost constructionauthorized by the CRE assets. This cost is capitalized as part of the construction cost of the pipelineequipment credited to the income statement. Once construction is completed, the Entity may recoverthese costs, including performmee, when considered on the basis of calculation of rates and thedepreciation of the pipeline.
Resolutions issued by the CRE, as discussed in Note 1, shown in one of the considerations that tookinto account the paiticular characteristics of the project under the resolutions and that was applied toeach project. A weighted average cost of capital (WACC for short) or an Internal Rate ofReturn(IRR) for deten'nining the tariffs which were adopted in these decisions. The WACC and IRR aboveconsider some ﬁnancial structure of each project and the cost of both debt and equity.

This loss ofrevenue, increasedexpenses or additional costs could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsof operations, cash flows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
The Company regularly works with volatile and hazardous materials that subject it to risks that maymaterially impact the Company’s operations.
The Company’s business involves storing and transporting highly ﬂammable and explosive materials, whichare subject to extensive regulation. Even if the Company complies with requisite environmental, sanitary, security,transportation, risk management and safety requirements and standards, its operations are subject to signiﬁcant hazardsassociated with using, storing, transporting and disposing of such materials, including:
- Explosions;

The Company’s natural gas distribution business may face increased campetition due to the expiration ofits exclusivity period.
The Company’s natural gas distribution business had been entitled to a 12—year period of exclusivity withrespect to each of its three distribution zones‘ As the last 0fthese exclusivity periods expired in 201 l, the Companycould face competition from other distributors of natural gas in all of the distribution zones as other distributors ofnatural gas are now legally permitted to build natural gas distribution systems within the distribution zones and competewith the Company for customers. To the extent that other distributors of natural gas expand or construct distributionsystems in the distribution zones, that expansion or market entry could create additional competition against the naturalgas provided to the Company’s customers, and if the Company is unable to successfully compete against any suchcompetitors, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.

Elements of the Company’s energy infrastructure may be exposed to cyber security risks. In addition to generalinformation and cyber risks, such as malware, malicious intent by insiders and inadvenent disclosure of sensitiveinformation, the energy industry faces evolving cyber security risks associated with protecting sensitive and conﬁdentialcustomer information, smart-grid infrastructure, automated metering, and other electronic infrastructure componentsDeployment of new business technologies represents a new and large-scale opportunity for attacks on informationsystems and conﬁdential information as well as the integrity of the energy grid and natural gas infrastructure Whilethe Company’s information technology systems have been and will likely continue to be subjected to the risk Ofcomputerviruses or other malware, unauthorized access, attempts and eyber or phishing attacks, to date the Company has notexperienced a material cybersecurity breaeh‘ Addressing these risks is the subject ofsigniﬁcant ongoing activities acrossthe Company’s businesses, but no assurance can be given that a successful attack will not occur. Any attack on theCompany’s information systems, the integrity of the energy grid or any of the Company’s facilities, or the unauthorizeduse of conﬁdential customer data could result in energy delivery service failures, ﬁnancial loss, violations of privacylaws, customer dissatisfaction and litigation, any ofwhieh, in turn, could have a material adverse effect on the Company” 5business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
In the ordinary course of the Company’s business, it collects and retains sensitive information, includingpersonal identiﬁcation information about customers and employees, customer energy usage and other infomation. Thetheft, damage or improper disclosure of sensitive electronic data can subject the Company to penalties for Violationof applicable privacy laws, subject it to claims from third parties, require compliance with notiﬁcation and monitoringregulations and harm reputation.
New or alternative energy sources could reduce the market for natural gas, reducing the Campany’srevenues from the natural gas business.
Currently, industrial customers of the natural gas distribution business use natural gas as their main source ofenergy for their operations. However, in the ﬁJture other energy sources might become available at competitive costs,This circumstance could affect the demand for natural gas and consequently the Company’s revenues and ﬁnancialposition.
Individual households in Mexico satisfy their energy needs mainly through electricity, LPG and natural gas,To the extent individual households use electricity, LPG or other alternative sources of energy, natural gas consumptionby individual household customers could diminish, which could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
Excess supply of energy and related products could negatively impact the results of the Company’stermaele'ctrica de Mexicali power plant.
Several of the wholesale markets supplied by merchant power plants have experienced signiﬁcant pricingdeclines due to excess supply of energy and related products If the Company is unable to sell Termoelectrica deMexicali power plant, its inability to sufﬁciently sell its output through long-term agreements or at future higherprices and any need to recognize losses with respect to the capital already invested in the project as aresult ofsigniﬁcantchanges to the market or regulatory conditions, among other factors, could have a material adverse effect on theCompany’s results ofoperations, The Company may manage risks at Termoelectrica de Mexicali by optimizing amonga mix offorward on-peak energy sales, daily and hourly spot market sales ofcapacity, energy and ancillary services,and longer—term structured transactions However, the Company cannot provide assurance regarding theimplementation of these risk management measures or how successful such implementation may be, and enteringinto long-term contracts in oversupplied markets could be difﬁcult, Although the Company’s board of directors, inFebruary 2016, approved a plan to market and sell the Company’s Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power plant, if theCompany is unable to successfully complete this sale, the Company would remain subject to the risks describedabove.

Severe weather conditions, natural disasters, catastraphic accidents, major equipmentfailures 0r acts ofterrorism could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s businesses, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows and/ar prospects.
Like other major industrial facilities, ours may be damaged by severe weather conditions, natural disasterssuch as earthquakes, tsunamis and ﬁres, catastrophic accidents, major equipment failures or acts of terrorism. Becausethe Company is in the business of using, storing, transporting and disposing of highly ﬂammable and explosivematerials and operating highly energized equipment, the risks such incidents may pose to the Company’s facilitiesand infrastructure, as well the risks to the surrounding communities, are substantially greater than the risks suchincidents may pose to a typical business. The facilities and infrastructure that the Company own and in which it hasinterests (or which in the future the Company may own or have an interest in) that may be subject to such incidentsinclude, but are not limited to:
- Natural gas, LPG and ethane pipelines, storage and compression facilities;- LNG and reﬁned product terminals and storage;- Electric transmission infrastructure; and
- Power generation facilities.
Such incidents could result in severe business disruptions, property damage, injuries or loss oflife, signiﬁcantdecreases in revenues and earnings, and/or signiﬁcant additional costs to us Any such incident could have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/orthe market price of its securitiesi
Depending on the nature and location of the facilities and infrastructure affected, any such incident alsocould cause catastrophic ﬁres; release of natural gas odorant; natural gas, LPG, ethane or reﬁned products leaks;explosions, spills or other signiﬁcant damage to natural resources or property belonging to third parties; personalinjuries, health impacts or fatalities; or present a nuisance to impacted communities. Any of these consequencescould lead to signiﬁcant claims against us, In some cases, the Company may be liable for damages even though theCompany is not at fault, and in cases where the concept of inverse condemnation, strict liability or similar legalconcepts (such as responsabilidad objctiva) apply, the Company may be liable for damages without being found tobe at fault or to have been negligent. Insurance coverage may signiﬁcantly increase in cost or become unavailablefor certain of these risks, and any insurance proceeds the Company receives may be insufﬁcient to cover theCompany’s losses or liabilities due to the existence oflimitations, exclusions, high deductibles, failure to complywith procedural requirements, and other factors, which could have material adverse effect on the Company’sbusinesses, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
Severe weather conditions may also impact the Company’s businesses Signiﬁcant rainstorms and associatedhigh winds, such as those caused by a strong El Niﬁo weather pattern, could damage the Company’s electric, naturalgas, LPG o reﬁned products infrastwcture, resulting in increased expenses, including higher maintenance and repaircosts, and interruptions in electricity and natural gas delivery services. As a result, these events can have signiﬁcantﬁnancial consequences, including regulatory penalties and disallowances if the Company’s utilities encounterdifﬁculties in restoring service to their customers on a timely basis. Further, the cost of storm restoration effortsmay not be fully recoverable through the regulatory process. Any such events could have a material adverse effecton the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market priceof its securities.

Risks Relating to Mexico
Adverse economic and political conditions in Mexico may materially adversely affect the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results afaperatians, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the marketprice of its securities.
Substantially all of the Company’s operations are conducted in Mexico and the Company’s potential for growthis centered in Mexico; the Company’s business is therefore signiﬁcantly dependent upon the performance of the Mexicaneconomy, Mexico has experienced economic crises in the past, caused by internal and external factors, characterizedby, among other things, exchange rate instability (including large devaluations), high inﬂation, high domestic interestrates, economic contraction, a reduction of international capital ﬂows, a reduction of liquidity in the banking sectorand high unemployment rates. As a result, such conditions, as well as the general condition of the Mexican economy,over which the Company has no control, could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancialcondition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
The Mexican government does not currently restrict the ability ofMexican companies or individuals to convertMexican pesos into US. Dollars (except for certain restrictions related to cash transactions involving a US. Dollarpayment to a Mexican bank) or other currencies and Mexico has not had a ﬁxed exchange rate policy since 1982, TheMexican peso has been subject to signiﬁcant devaluations against the US. Dollar in the past and may be subject tosigniﬁcant ﬂuctuations in the future Severe devaluations 0r depreciations 0f the Mexican peso may result ingovernmental intervention to institute restrictive exchange control policies, as has occurred before in Mexico and otherLatin American countries. Accordingly, ﬂuctuations in the value of the Mexican peso against other currencies,particularly the US. Dollar, may have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsof operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
After being signiﬁcantly impacted by the global economic crisis that began in 2008, Mexico’s gross domesticproduct, or GDP, fell 6.1% in 2009, the sharpest decline since 1932, according to the World Bank. Mexico’s GDP grewby 2.0%, 2.3% and 2.6%, respectively, in 2017, 2016 and 2015. However, ifthe Mexican economy experiences anotherrecession, if inﬂation or interest rates increase signiﬁcantly, if Mexico's sovereign debt credit rating is downgraded orif the Mexican economy is otherwise adversely impacted, this could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
New and unanticipated tax reforms may be approved
Mexican tax legislation is frequently amended, and therefore there is no guarantee that the current legalframework will not be amended in a way that might adversely affect the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition,results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
The main effects of the tax reforms in 2016 are as follows:
i. The return of accelerated depreciation for Investments in ﬁxed assets made during September to Decemberof 2015, 2016 and 2017 by companies engaged in the constwction and extension of transportationinfrastructure, such as roads, highways and bridges, as well as equipment for production, transportation,distribution and supply of energy,
ii, Companies engaged in electricity generation infrastructure will not be subject to thin capitalization rules.In this regard, companies engaged in electricity generation inﬁ'astructure will be able to deduct for Mexicanincome tax purposes all interest paid to foreign related parties, even if their debt to equity ratio exceedsthe maximum established in the Mexican Income Tax Law (Ley del Impuesto Sobre la Renta), providedthat all additional shareholder requirements for authorized deductions are fulﬁlled,
iii. Companies that reinvest proﬁts generated from 20l4 to 2016 will be able to apply a credit against the
income tax withholding at the 10% rate applicable to dividend distributions to Mexican resident individualshareholders. The amount of the credit will depend on the year in which the distribution is canied out,

43.hocr: 
and will be 1% on the dividend distribution ifpaid during 2017, 2% if paid during 2018, and 5% ifpaidduring 2019 and subsequent years.
iv. A new account similar to the net tax proﬁts account, known as CUFIN (cuenta de utilidad ﬁscal neta),will be created for companies engaged in energy generation through renewable sources or through efﬁcientelectricity cogeneration systems. These companies, which currently are entitled to a 100% depreciationrate of investments in machinery or equipment, as a consequence may not generate CUFIN duringinvestment periods. The creation of this new account would allow such companies to distribute proﬁtsVia dividends without further taxation at the corporate level. The Company cannot giarantee that thecurrent political situation or future events in Mexico will not have a material adverse effect on its business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
The introduction 0fclass action lawsuits into the Mexican legal system could have an adverse effect an theCompany’s operations.
In 2011 Mexico adopted a new legal system that allows for the commencement of class action lawsuits onmatters relating to the consumption ofgoods and services and the environment, This could give rise to the commencementof class action lawsuits against the Company by its customers or other market participants Because the relevant lawshave not yet been the subject of extensive judicial interpretation or enforcement, the Company cannot predict theoutcome of any class action lawsuit brought against the Company under such laws, including the extent to which theCompany may be found liable and the effect thereofon the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsofoperations,cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities. See “Regulation, Permits and Environmental Matters -Legal Framework; Taxation - Constitutional Amendment on Class Actions.”
Changes in the relative value of the Mexican peso t0 the U.S. Dollar may have a material adverse effect onthe Company.
The Mexican peso-US, Dollar exchange rate is important for the Company because of its effect on theCompany's business, ﬁnancial condition, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows and prospects. In general, as described below,a depreciation of the peso will likely result in an increase in the Company’s operating margins and an appreciation ofthe peso will likely result in a decrease in the Company’s operating margins. This is because the aggregate amount ofthe Company’s net sales denominated in or linked to US. Dollars exceeds the aggregate amount of the Company’s costof sales and other selling, general and administrative expenses denominated in or linked to U.S. Dollars. In addition,a depreciation of the Mexican peso will likely affect the value of US Dollar receivables and payables and peso-denominated deferred income tax assets and liabilities See “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of FinancialCondition and Results 0f0perations - Effects ofCurrency Exchange Rates on Income Tax Expense.”
The majority of the Company’s net sales are either denominated in, or linked to the value of, the U.S. Dollar,However, a portion of the Company’s cost of goods sold, including labor costs and other selling, general andadministrative expenses are invoiced in pesos and the Company’s Mexican taxes will also be paid in pesos, as may bedebt obligations the Company incurs in the future. Consequently, the real appreciation or depreciation of the pesorelative to the US Dollar can have an effect on the Company’s operating margins and the Company’s income taxexpense. The decision by the U.S. Federal Reserve to increase interest rates on banks’ reserves could also impact theMexican peso to US. Dollar exchange rate, Changes in the Mexican peso-U,S, Dollar exchange rate could have amaterial adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospectsand/or the market price of its securities‘
An increase in interest rates in the United States could adversely impact the Mexican economy and mayhave a negative effect on the Company ’s ﬁnancial conditian arperfarmance.
A decision by the US Federal Reserve to increase interest rates on banks’ reserves may lead to a generalincrease in interest rates in the United States, This, in turn, may redirect the ﬂow of capital away from emergingmarkets and into the United States, because investors may be able to obtain greater risk-adjusted returns in larger ormore developed economies rather than in Mexico, Thus, companies in emerging market economies such as Mexico

could ﬁnd it more difﬁcult and expensive to borrow capital and reﬁnance existing debt, This may negatively affectthe Company’s potential for economic growth and could have a material adverse effect on the Company's business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its Shares
The increase in violence in Mexico has adversely impacted, amt may continue to adversely impact, theMexican economy and may have a negative effect an the Company ’s ﬁnancial condition or performance.
Over the past few years Mexico has experienced a signiﬁcant increase in Violence relating to illegal drugtrafﬁcking, particularly in Mexico’s northern states near the US, border, and most of the Company’s facilities arelocated in this region This increase in violence has had an adverse impact on the economic activity in Mexico. Also,social instability in Mexico and adverse social or political developments in or affecting Mexico could have a materialadverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial conditions, results ofoperations, cash ﬂows, prospects, and/or themarket price of its securities.
E vents and the perception ofrisk in other countries, especially the United States, China and other emergingmarket countries, may materially adversely affect the marketprice 0fMexican securities, including those issued byus.
The market price of securities issued by Mexican companies is affected to varying degrees by economic andmarket conditions in other countries, including the United States, China and other Latin American and emerging marketcountries Therefore, investors’ reactions to developments in these other countries may have an adverse effect on themarket value of securities of Mexican issuers Crises in the United States or other emerging market countries mayreduce investor interest in securities issued by Mexican companies, including those issued by us.
In the past, the development of adverse economic conditions in other emerging market countries resulted, ingeneral, in capital ﬂight, and as a consequence, in a decrease in the value of foreign investments in Mexico The ﬁnancialcrisis that originated in the United States during the third trimester of 2008 triggered a recession of global scale. Thisadversely affected the Mexican economy and Mexican capital markets, both directly and indirectly, and led to, amongother things, ﬂuctuations in the trading prices of securities issued by publicly-owned companies, scarcity of credit, cutsin expenditures, slowdown in the global economy, exchange rate volatility, and inﬂationary pressures. Recent turmoilin other large economies, such as those in Europe and China, could also have such effect Any of these factors, if theywere to occur again, could negatively affect the market value of the Company’s securities and make it more difﬁcultfor it to access capital markets and ﬁnance its operations in the future on acceptable terms, or at all, which could havea material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospectsand/or the market price of its securities.
Further, the Mexican economy is affected by international economic and market conditions generally, andespecially by economic and market conditions in the United States For example, share prices on the Mexican StockExchange have traditionally been sensitive to ﬂuctuations in US. interest rates and activity on the maj orU.S. securitiesexchanges.
In addition, inrecent years economic conditions in Mexico have become increasingly correlated with economicconditions in the United States as a result of NAFTA and increased economic activity between the two countries.Adverse economic conditions in the United States, the termination or re-negotiation of NAFTA or other related eventscould have a signiﬁcant adverse effect on the Mexican economy. The Company cannot assure you that events in otheremerging market countries, in the United States or elsewhere will not materially adversely affect the Company’ s business,ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities
The Company could be materially adversely affected by violations of the Mexican F ederal AntiearruptionLaw in Public Contracting, the U.S. Foreign Corrupt Practices Act and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws.
The Mexican Federal Anticorruption Law in Public Contracting (Ley F ederal Anticarrupcién enContrataciones Pu’blicas), the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, or FCPA, and similar worldwide anti-bribery laws
generally prohibit companies and their intermediaries from making improper payments to government ofﬁcials and

other persons for the purpose of obtaining 0r retaining business or any business advantage. Many of the Company'soperations require it to use third parties to conduct business or to interact with people who are deemed to be governmentalofﬁcials under the FCPA. Thus, the Company faces the risk of receipt of unauthorized payments, offers of paymentsor other things ofvalue by the Company's employees, contractors or agents. It is the Company's policy to implementcompliance procedures to prohibit these practices. However, there can be no assurance that the Company’s internalcontrol policies and procedures will protect it from unlawful acts committed by its employees, contractors, associatedpersons or agents, regardless of whether such conduct occurs within or outside the United States‘ Violations of theselaws, or allegations of such violations, could damage the Company's reputation, be expensive to defend, disrupt theCompany’s business and could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s business, ﬁnancial condition, resultsof operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities.
Risks Relating to the Company’s Shares and Other Securities Issued by it

The Company is a holding company and depends on the results afoperations of its subsidiaries and jointventures.
The Company is a holding company with no independent operations or substantial assets other than the capitalstock of its operating companies and joint ventures. Accordingly, it depends on the results ofoperations of its subsidiarycompanies and joint ventures, Each of its subsidiaries and joint ventures is a distinct legal entity, and under certaincircumstances, legal and contractual restrictions may limit the Company’s ability to obtain cash from its subsidiariesand joint ventures, In addition, under Mexican law, Mexican subsidiaries may only pay dividends (1) out of retainedearnings included in ﬁnancial statements that have been approved by their respective partners during a panners' meeting,(2) after all losses from prior ﬁscal years have been satisﬁed, and (3) if the corresponding entity has allocated 5% ofits net income for such ﬁscal year to its legal reserve, which allocation must be made on an annual basis until its legalreserve represents at least 20% of such entity’s paid in capital Any adverse change in the ﬁnancial condition or resultsof operations of the Company’s subsidiaries or joint ventures could have a material adverse effect on the Company’sbusiness, ﬁnancial condition, results of operations, cash ﬂows, prospects and/or the market price of its securities,
The volatility and the lack afliquidity of the Mexican securities market may signiﬁcantly limit the abilityofinvestors to sell their shares for the desiredprice at the desired time.
Investing in Mexican securities, such as the Company’s shares, involves a higher degree of risk than investingin securities of issuers from countries with more stable political and economic environments and such investments aregenerally considered speculative in nature These investments are subject to certain economic and political risks, suchas, among others: (1) changes to the regulatory, tax, economic and political environment that may affect the ability ofinvestors to receive payment, in whole or in part, with respect to their investments, and (2) restrictions on foreigninvestment and on repatriation ofinvested capital. The Company cannot assure you that the liquidity of its shares willsigniﬁcantly increase, which could affect the ability of the purchasers of the shares to sell them at the price and timeexpected.
An active and liquid market for the Company’s shares may not continue, which could limit your ability tosell your shares at the desiredprice and time.
The Mexican securities market is substantially smaller, less liquid, more volatile and more concentrated thanthe major international securities markets. The relative volatility and iliquidity of the Mexican securities markets maysubstantially limit your ability to sell your shares at the time and price you desire, In addition, the Mexican StockExchange operates a system which suspends trading in shares of a patticular issuer when ﬂuctuations in the price ofsuch shares (expressed as percentage of that day’s opening price) exceed certain levels As a result 0fthese factors, youmay not be able to sell your shares at the time or price you desire or at all.
Future issuances ofshares, or the pussibility orperception 0fsuchfuture issuanees, may materially affectthe market price of the Company ’5 shares.
In the ﬁxture, the Company may issue additional shares in connection with acquisitions, investments orrepayment of its debt or for other purposes. The number of such shares issued could constitute a material pottion ofthe Company’s then outstanding share capital, The Company cannot predict what effect, if any, future sales ofadditionalshares, or the availability of additional shares for future sale, will have on the market price of the Company’s sharesiSales of substantial amounts of additional shares in the public market, or the perception that sales of this type couldoccur, could depress the market price of the Company’s shares and may make it more difﬁcult for you to sell shares ata time and price that you deem appropriate, Any such issuances could also result in a dilution ofshareholders’ economicand voting rights in the Company or a negative market perception and potentially in a lower market price of its shares

If the Company decides to issue debt or preferred securities in the future or otherwise incur indebtedness, itis possible that these debt or preferred securities or indebtedness will be governed by an indenture or other instrumentcontaining covenants restricting the Company’s operating ﬂexibility and limiting its ability to make distributions toholders of its shares‘ Additionally, any convertible or exchangeable securities that the Company issues in the futuremay have rights, preferences and privileges, including with respect to distributions, more favorable than those of theCompany’s shares and may result in dilution to holders of its shares. Because the Company’s decision to issue securitiesin any future offering or otherwise incur indebtedness will depend on market conditions and other factors beyond itscontrol, the Company cannot predict or estimate the amount, timing or nature of future offerings or ﬁnancings, any ofwhich could materially reduce the market price of the Company’s shares and dilute the value of its shares,

The protections afforded ta minority shareholders in Mexico are different, and may be more difﬁcult toenforce, than those in the United States amt other countries.
The protections afforded to minority shareholders in Mexico are different from, and may be weaker than, thosein other jurisdictions, including the United States. Although Mexican law permits any shareholder owning 5% of theCompany’s outstanding common shares to ﬁle a shareholder derivative suit against corporate action upon meetingcertain procedural requirements and provides speciﬁc duties of care and loyalty applicable to the Company's directorsand to the Company’s principal ofﬁcers, the substantive law concerning ﬁduciary duties of directors has not been thesubject of extensive judicial interpretation in Mexico.
In addition, there are no procedures for shareholder class action lawsuits in Mexico as they are conducted inthe United States, and there are different procedural requirements for bringing lawsuits against directors. In Mexico,only shareholder derivative actions, as opposed to direct actions, may be initiated for breach of ﬁduciary dutiesTherefore, it may be more difﬁcult for minority shareholders to enforce their rights against us, the Company’s directorsor the Company’s indirect controlling shareholder than it would be forminority shareholders of a United States companyMexican regulations provide remedies that may differ from those contemplated under the securities laws in otherjurisdictions including the United States Therefore, shareholders may not be able to ﬁle the types of legal actions or

Preemptive rights may be unavailable to mm-Mexican shareholders.
Under Mexican law, whenever the Company issues new shares ofcapital stock for cash, the Company generallymust grant preemptive rights to the Company’s shareholders, giving them the right to purchase a sufﬁcient number ofshares to maintain their existing ownership percentage, except for: (l) shares issued by the Company in connectionwith mergers, (2) shares issued in connection with the conversion of convertible securities (obligaciones convertibles)whose underlying shares have already been approved and are held in the Company's treasury, (3) shares issued inconnection with the capitalization of shareholders’ equity accounts, (4) repurchased shares held in the Company’streasury to be resold through the stock market, and (5) shares to be placed in a public offering pursuant to the MexicanSecurities Market Law, The Company may not be able to offer shares to non»Mexican shareholders pursuant topreemptive rights granted to the Company’s shareholders in connection with any future issuance of shares unless aregistration statement under the Securities Act is effective or a similar procedure is followed with respect to such rightsand shares or an exemption from the registration requirements of the Securities Act or a similar exception is available
The Company intends to evaluate at the time of any rights offering the costs and potential liabilities associatedwith a registration statement to enable U.S, shareholders to exercise their preemptive rights, the direct and indirectbeneﬁts of enabling us shareholders to exercise preemptive rights and any other factors that the Company considersappropriate at such time. The Company will then decide whether to ﬁle such a registration statement. The Companyis not required to ﬁle any such registration statement and such registration statement may not in fact be ﬁled, As aresult, U.S. shareholders may not be able to exercise their preemptive rights in connection with future issuances of theCompany’s shares ofeapital stock. In this event, the economic and voting interest of US. shareholders in the Company’stotal equity may decrease and US. shareholders would suffer dilution with respect to their holdings of the Company’sshares
Corporate disclosure in Mexico may differ from disclosure regularly published by or about issuers ofsecurities in other countries, including the United States.

Certain provisions in the Company’s bylaws could make it difﬁcult for a third party to acquire a signiﬁcantownership percentage of the Company’s shares without creating an obligation to purchase all or part of the Company’sshares. These bylaw provisions could discourage certain types oftransactions involving the acquisition 0fthe Company’sshares Also, these provisions could discourage transactions in which the Company’s shareholders would receive apremium on current market value for their shares. For example, subject to certain exceptions, any person who seeks toacquire beneﬁcial ownership of 10% or more of the Company’s outstanding capital stock will need to obtain the priorwritten approval of the Company’s board ofdirectors. If the approval of the Company’s board of directors is requiredunder its bylaws for any share acquisition or voting agreement, and such acquisition or voting agreement is undertakenwithout such approval, the voting rights with respect to such shares may be null and void, and a person who acquiresshares in Violation of these provisions would be required to sell them within 90 days of such acquisition The Company’sboard of directors may consider certain factors set forth in the Company’s bylaws, as well as any prior approvals ofgovernmental authorities required for such acquisition, including antitrust or other regulatory approvals (such as anyprior approval of the US Federal Energy Regulatory Commission required for such proposed purchase) See“Description of the Company’s capital Stock and Bylaws-Anti»Takeover Protections” and “Regulatory, Permits andEnvironmental Matters— Laws Applicable to Electricity Generation”

° Power export: The process of generating electricity and supplying such electricity to users in any electricenergy market abroad (including the US energy market).
' Power impart: The purchase of electric energy abroad (including the United States) from providers for self-supply, or the purchase ofelectric energy from a power plant abroad, when interconnected to the MexicanNational Grid‘
Applicable laws related to Natural Gas, LPG, Ethane and Oil Products activities
Article 27 of the Mexican Constitution sets forth the general principles that regulate activities involving oil,natural gas and other hydrocarbons in Mexico. Historically, Article 27 prohibited the Mexican government from enteringinto agreements or granting concessions with respect to hydrocarbons activities and speciﬁed that certain activities involvingoil and other hydrocarbons were exclusively reserved to the Mexican government under a vertical integration system
In 1995, the Mexican Congress passed a bill allowing private-sector participation in transportation, storage,distribution and commercialization Ofnatural gas and LPG in Mexico, The Natural Gas Regulations (Reglamento dc GasNatural) were published in 1995‘ The LPG Regulations (Reglamento dc Gas Licuado dc Petréleo) were issued in 1999.
In December 2013, certain provisions of the Mexican Constitution related to the hydrocarbon sectorwere amended,and the legal framework applicable to, among others, the upstream and midstream sectors was modiﬁed in August 2014and October 2014 with the promulgation of new laws and the enactment of implementing regulations. This allowed theMexican government to grant contracts to private-seetor entities in the upstream sector through public tenders Theseamendments also allow private-sector entities to obtain permits for the processing, reﬁning, marketing, transporting, storing,importing and exporting hydrocarbons, including the processing, compression, liquefaction, regasiﬂcation, transportation,distribution, marketing and retail ofnatural gas; the transportation, storage, distribution, marketing and retail of 011 products,including LPG; and the transportation (through pipelines) and related storage of petrochemicals, including ethane.
New legislation enacted in 2014, including the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law (Ley de Hidrocarburos) preservedthe concept of state ownership over hydrocarbons while located in the subsoil and opened the hydrocarbon sector to theparticipation of private companies, subject to eenain regulatory requirements,
In particular, in October 2014, two sets of implementing regulations for the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law wereenacted: (i) the Mexican Hydrocarbon General Regulations (Reglamento de la Lay dc Hidrocarburos) and (ii) the

Regulations Relating to the Activities Speciﬁed in Title Three of the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law (Reglamcnto de lasactividades a que se refiere cl Titulo Tamera de la Lay dc Hidmcarburos), These regulations and the GeneralAdministrativeRules (Dispasiciones Administrativas dc Cardcter General) issued by the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commissionregulate Mexico’s natural gas, LNG, LPG, oil product and ethane markets‘
Given its business, the Company is primarily regulated by the Regulations Relating to the Activities Speciﬁed inTitle Three of the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law, They establish the following with respect to storage, transportation,distribution and marketing permits:
- technical requirements applicable to the operations of permit-holders, such as efﬁciency, frequency, safety,continuity and uniformity in the supply Ofnatural gas;
- open access obligations;
- the wles applicable to the term, duration and renewal of permits;
° the rules applicable to the modiﬁcation, transfer, cancellation and revocation of permits;
- the requirements to be met for the approval of permits;
- the procedures for the granting of permits;
' the rules related to the provision ofdifferent services, including speciﬁc obligations ofpermit- holders; and
° the regulation ofrates and terms of the service
The Mexican Hydrocarbons Law allows private-sector entities holding a permit granted by the Mexican EnergyRegulatory Commission to store, transport, distribute, commercialize and carry out direct sales of hydrocarbons, as wellas to own and operate pipelines and liquefaction, regasiﬁcation, compression and decompression stations or terminals,and related equipment in accordance with technical and other regulations In addition, private-sector entities may importor export hydrocarbons subject to a permit from the Mexican Ministry of Energy. Permits granted prior to the enactmentof the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law, such as several of the Company’s permits, including their general terms and conditions,will remain in force during their original term, and rights held by permit-holders will not be affected by the new laws andregulations, However, new permits, such as marketing permits granted by the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commissionand impon and export permits granted by the Mexican Ministry of Energy are required in connection with the Company’soperations. The Company has applied for and obtained the new required marketing permits within the statutory time period,
Activities in the midstream and downstream natural gas, LPG, ethane and oil product industries are subject tothe provisions of the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law, the Mexican Energy Sector Coordinated Regulatory Agencies Law (Leyde las Organos Reguladares Coordinadas en Materia Energética), the Mexican National Agency for Industrial Safety andProtection of the Environment of the Hydrocarbons Sector Law (Ley de la Agenda Nacional de Seguridad Industrial yde Pmteccio’n al Media Ambiente del Sector Hidrocarburos), the Mexican Hydrocarbon General Regulations, theRegulations Relating to the Activities Speciﬁed in Title Three of the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law and applicableenvironmental and safety regulations. Directives and General Rules (DispositionesAdministrativas dc Canister General)issued by the Mexican energy and environmental authorities, Mexican Ofﬁcial Standards (Normas Oficiales Mexicanas)and terms and conditions set forth in related permits also regulate the Company’ 5 activities See “Risk Factors»The Companyoperates in a highly regulated environment, and its profitability depends on its ability t0 comply with a number aflawsand regulations (m a timely and efficient basis.”
Building and operating natural gas, LNG, LPG, ethane and oil products storage facilities, pipelines and distributionsystems require governmental permits and authorizations from federal, local and municipal authorities, such as the MexicanEnergy Regulatory Commission, the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission, SEMARNAT, ASEA and theMexican Ministry of Energy, real estate rights—of—way, and other related authorizations Permits issued by the MexicanEnergy Regulatory Commission also impose a series of regulatory obligations and speciﬁc terms and conditions commonlyreferred to as “general terms and conditions (T érminos y Condiciancs Generates)
Open AccessPursuant to the Natural Gas Regulations (under which the Company obtained several of its permits but whichwas repealed by the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law and its regulations), there were two types of natural gas storage and
transportation permits: open—access (to provide services in a way similar to a utility) and self—use (granted exclusively toend-users or a group of end-users organized in a special purpose vehicle or company). With the exception of a self-use

All of the Company’s open-access facilities are required to grant nondiscriminatory access on a reasonable basisto any shipper that requests the service, provided there is available capacity in the system/facility and the parties reach anagreement on the subject matter, as set forth under the applicable general rules issued by the Mexican Energy RegulatoryCommission. Open-access permit-holders are heavily regulated and supervised by the Mexican Energy RegilatoryCommission Regarding the self—use natural gas pipeline that serves the Termoele’ctrica de Mexicali power generationfacility, the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law provides that permits issued prior to the enactment of the law will remain in forceduring their original termi
Permit holders subject to open access obligations that have available capacity are required to perform open seasonsto allocate such capacity to third parties, Available capacity is deemed to exist when (1) a new system is developed, (2)the capacity of an existing system is increased in view of operational efﬁciencies or an extension of infrastructure, (3)existing capacity has not been allocated by means ofa service contract, or if having been contracted under executed servicesagreements is not actually being used by the corresponding users or (4) the end user transfers the capacity through thepermit-holden
Rates
Midstream and downstream natural gas, LNG, LPG and oil products services are subject to “maximum regulatedrates” that are determined by the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission. Permit holders may grant discounts or reachspeciﬁc agreements with respect to rates subject to general rules issued by the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission,These agreements must be registered with the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission, which will allow public accessto the agreements
Marketing and Crass-shareholding Restrictions
The Mexican Hydrocarbons Law establishes that a permit from the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission isrequired to commercialize natural gas. As a result, marketing activities carried out by the Company’s subsidiary, lEnovaMarketing, are subject to a permit Pursuant to the Mexican Hydrocarbons Law and other applicable laws, lEnova Marketinghas obtained the required permits from the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission to continue marketing natural gas,Vendors or marketing companies are bound to retain, directly or through third parties, transportation, distribution or storageservices from other permit-holders, In addition, with certain exceptions set forth in the law, storage and open-accesstransportation permit—holders are generally banned from marketing natural gas stored in their facilities or transportedthrough their systems.
The Mexican Hydrocarbons Law provides cross—shareholding restrictions with respect to vendors and open-aecesstransportation or storage permit-holders. However, cross-shareholding may be allowed by the Mexican Energy RegulatoryCommission, with previous approval from the Mexican Federal Economic Competition Commission, provided that suchcross-shareholding does not affect competition, market efﬁciency or effective open access. Compliance with theserequirements may be met by guaranteeing independent operations or by establishing legal and comorate mechanisms toprevent intervention in operations and management, According to the applicable rules, the following may be required: (1)the strict legal unbundling of permitted activities or a functional, operational and accounting separation, (2) participationlimitations on a company’s share capital, (3) maximum participation limitations for economic agents who performmarketing and (4) the reservation of capacity in storage facilities and pipelines. Some of the Company’s assets are subjectto cross-shareholding regulation by the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission; therefore, such assets have obtained theproper authorizations and complied with the applicable regulation in such regard.

Electricity Generation and Export
Given the amendment to the Mexican Constitution in December 2013 and the enactment of the Mexican ElectricIndustry Law (Lay de la Industria Eléctrica), which repealed and replaced the former Mexican Public Electricity ServiceLaw (Lay del Scrvicio Pu'blico dc Encrgz’a Eléctrica), private entities are allowed to obtain permits for the generation andmarketing of electricity in the wholesale electricity market, and to participate in the constmction, operation andadministration of power plants, The Mexican State continues to carry out the transmission and distribution of electricitythrough the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission or other state- owned companies, but it may enter into contracts withprivate companies related to such activities, including contracts for the ﬁnancing, installation, maintenance, procurement,operation and expansion of the electric network infrastructure. Planning and control of the grid falls under the exclusiveauthority of the Mexican Federal government and is carried out through CENACE, the governmental body responsiblefor managing the national electrical grid, acting as an independent system operator for the wholesale electricity market.
In terms of the Electricity Market Rules (Bases del Mercado Eléctrico), private generators of electricity may

participate in a new wholesale open market operated by CENACE by selling energy and associated products to the MexicanFederal Electricity Commission or to “Qualiﬁed Users,” Within such market, only entities who become market participant“Qualiﬁed Users” (i.e. entities that register with the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission and that have a yearlydemand ofat least 5 MW and a yearly energy intake of at least 20 GWh) will be able to purchase electricity and associatedproducts through long-term power coverage agreements or in a spot market either from the Mexican Federal ElectricityCommission or from other third patties,
Under the Mexican Electric Industry Law, power stations with an installed capacity of 05 MW or more as wellas those represented by a generator in the wholesale market (regardless of the installed capacity) will require an energygeneration permit, Power stations with an installed capacity of less than 05 MW will not require a permit but will need asupplier acting on their behalfto sell their energy and associated products in the wholesale market.
Permits granted prior to the enactment of the Mexican Electric Industry Law (such as the 2001 export permit forits Termoeléctrica de Mexicali power generation facility, the 2013 export permit for its Energia Sierra Juérez wind powergeneration facility, and the generation permit for its Ventika wind power generation facility) will continue to be effective,and rights held by pennit-holders will not be affected by the new laws and regulations,
Pursuant to the Mexican Electric Industry Law and implementing regulations, certain clean energy usageobligations (for the reduction of air emissions) are applicable to participants in the electric energy market. Such participantsinclude energy suppliers, “Qualiﬁed Users,” ﬁnal users whose source ofenergy results from a self- supply (abasto aislado)scheme and load points in grandfathered interconnection agreements. These usage obligations will be credited by cleanenergy certiﬁcates and will be required starting in 2018 in the proportion to the actual energy consumption that the MexicanMinistry ofEnergy determines each year, which is 5% for 2018, 58% for 2019, 7.4% for 2020, 10.9% f0r2021 and 13.9%for 2022.
As of 2018, clean energy certiﬁcates will be issued to “clean energy generators,” such as the Pima, Tepezalé andRumorosa Solar projects under development. Electric power generators will be entitled to receive a clean energy certiﬁcateper MW/hr generated at clean power plants (such as wind and solar farms, geothermal energy projects and cogenerationpower plants), These clean energy certiﬁcates will be negotiable through the spot market, long-term power coverageagreements in the wholesale electricity market or through private power coverage agreements between market participants,
In December 2015, the Mexican Energy Transition Law was published, This new law, which repeals a formerrenewable energy statute, aims to regulate the use of sustainable energy and obligations regarding clean energy and reductionof polluting air emissions in the electricity industry. Consequently, the Mexican government must implement strategiesand progTams to achieve speciﬁc goals regarding clean energy; at present, such goals consist of generating at least 25%ofthe electricity in Mexico from clean sources by 2018, 30% by 2021 and 35% by 2024. The national goals that have beenestablished in the Mexican Energy Transition Law will be achieved by means ofseveral mechanisms, including voluntaryagreements between private entities and the Mexican Ministry of Energy, voluntary certiﬁcation awards, and theaforementioned obligation to use clean energy and acquire clean energy certiﬁcates.

Constitutional Amendments on Class Action Lawsuits
On July 29, 2010, Article 17 0f the Mexican Constitution was amended in order to allow class action lawsuits tobe brought in federal courts in connection with civil actions on matters related, among others, to consumer protection andenvironmental law. Consequently, on August 30, 2011, the Mexican Federal Code ofCivil Procedure (Co'digo Federal deProccdimientos Civilcs), the Mexican Federal Consumer Protection Law and the Mexican General Law on EcologicalEquilibrium and Environmental Protection (Lay General del Equilibrio Ecolo'gz‘ca y [a Pmteccién a1 Ambiente) wereamended to incorporate class action lawsuits. Such amendments became effective on March 1, 2012, though as of the dateof this report, to its knowledge, only a few class action lawsuits have been brought before the federal courts in connectionwith environmental matters.
Mexican Federal Environmental Liability Law

Recent Developments in Mexican Securities Issuer Regulations
In September 2015, the Mexican Finance Ministry (Sccretarz’a de Hacienda y Crédito Pu’blico), through theMexican Tax Administration Service (Servicio de Administracién Tributaria) published the Fourth Resolution ofModiﬁcations to the Miscellaneous Tax Resolution for 2015 (Cuarta Resolucién dc Modiﬁcacioncs a la Resolucio’nMiscela'nea Fiscal para 2015) in the Mexican Federal Ofﬁcial Gazette, providing the tax treatment applicable to a newtype of tax-advantaged publicly traded vehicle, which the Company refers to as FIBRA E, similar to the master limitedpartnership, or MLP, structures that have been used in the United States with respect to certain energy assets. Such refonhwas subsequently modiﬁed in December 2015 and April 2016‘
In general terms, investments in F ibra E’s would permit companies to raise capital at lower costs, compared tomore traditional sources of ﬁnancing, by grouping assets that qualify as hydrocarbons, electricity and certain other eligibleinfrastmcture assets, including pipeline, oil and petrochemical storage facilities, which generate stable cash ﬂows,Investments in such vehicles would have certain tax advantages for investors. For example, the sale of securities issuedby FIBRA E’s would be exempt ﬁ‘om taxation in Mexico, for both Mexican resident individuals and non—residents withouta permanent establishment in Mexico, similar to the existing tax regulations applicable to real—estate FIBRAs: (1) therewould be no income tax payable at F IBRA E and investment company levels, but only at the level of the unitholders whena FIBRA E distributes net taxable income; (2) no income tax payable on dividend distributions and capital returns; and(3) no additional tax payable on dividend distributions. Also, FIBRA E’s may shield net taxable income distributed byinvestment companies with the deduction of a defen'ed expense created when acquiring investment companies.
In addition, similar to MLPs, Fibra E’s allow the manager thereof (which is expected to be an afﬁliate ofthesponsor) to maintain full control of both the FIBRA E and the respective investment companies, granting only minimumcorporate rights to unit holders. A technical committee, comprised of a maj ority of independent members, would also haveto be established to supervise the manager and to resolve any transactions that represent a conﬂict of interest with respect

to the manager.
Fibra E’s are subject to the minimum requirements of corporate govemance, including disclosure of votingagreements, compensation of administrators, minority rights, and supervision by committees, similar to the committeesofboards ofdirectors of corporations.
The Company cannot make any prediction regarding the timing or scope of such regulations nor of theireffectiveness or success in bringing new capital or investors into Mexico’s energy and other infrastructure markets. Finally,the Company can make no assurances that it or its assets will be able to take advantage of new opportunities arising fromthe enactment of these regulations, In fact, the effect of such regulations may be to increase the competition that theCompany faces in raising capital efﬁciently, or bring new competitors into the market for energy infrastructure assets,which could make it more difﬁcult for the Company to win or develop projects at attractive returns.
PermitsH ydrocarbons A ctivities Permits
Permits for hydrocarbon activities provide general terms and conditions (Términos y Condiciones Generalespara[a Prestacia’n delServicio) to regulate the activities governed by the permits Such general terms and conditions are approvedand registered with the Mexican Energy Regulatory Commission with respect to each permit.

INDUSTRY OVERVIEW
viii) Market Information
General
In Mexico, the natural gas and power sectors are highly regulated and have a high level ofparticipation bythe Mexican government, In the power sector, the Mexican government owns 100% of the Mexican Federal ElectricityCommission, which until recently was a decentralized entity of the federal government. The Mexican Federal ElectricityCommission is responsible for the planning of the Mexican power grid as well as the generation, transmission,

distribution and sale of energy. In the natural gas sector, the government owns 100% of Pemex and its subsidiaries,including Pemex TRI, which until recently was also a decentralized entity ofthe federal govemment. Pemex TRI isresponsible for the exploration and production of petroleum and other hydrocarbons, among other activities. Legislativechanges in Mexico in the 19905 in both the natural gas and power sectors created signiﬁcant investment opportunitiesfor the private sector. In December 2013, a new and substantial legislative change occurred as a result ofamendmentsto the Mexican Constitution. The reform created a new legal framework for the oil, gas and electric power industriesin Mexico. The main objectives of the reform were to open the oil, gas and power sectors in Mexico to privateinvestment. Both Pemex and the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission will continue to play a key role in the naturalgas and electric power sectors as state productive enterprises (empresas productivas del Estada), owned and controlledby the federal government, with entrepreneurial, commercial and ﬁnancial objectives.
The Mexican Natural Gas Industry
Prior to the recent energy reform, natural gas production was carried out exclusively by the Mexicangovernment through Pemex and its subsidiaries, The deregulation of the natural gas industry started in 1995, whenchanges to Mexican law allowed private sector participation in the midstream (transportation and storage) anddownstream (distribution) natural gas sectors The National Pipeline System (Sistema Nacional dc Gasoductas) stillholds a dominant position in the market through the newly created Centre Nacional de Control Del Gas Natural orCENAGAS. The recently enacted energy reform allows private sector entities to store, transport, distribute, market andcarry out direct sales of natural gas, as well as to operate pipelines and liquefaction, regasiﬁcation, compression andde—compression stations or terminals.
According to the Natural Gas Prospect (2017-2031) published by the Mexican Ministry of Energy, privateinvestment in the natural gas sector is comprised as follows:
- 57 active permits for open-access transportation systems;- 23 distribution companies; and
- 3 LNG import terminals
In addition, as a result of the auction rounds organized by the National Hydrocarbons Commission (“CNH”),several private companies have been awarded contracts for the exploration and extraction of hydrocarbons
As a consequence of the environmental and economic advantages Ofnatural gas over other energy alternatives,demand for natural gas in Mexico has increased signiﬁcantly, mainly due to the increased usage Ofnatural gas by theMexican Federal Electricity Commission and Independent Power Producers (“IPPs”). In addition, these advantageshave led to an increase in consumption ofnatural gas in other industries, where it is a less expensive and more efﬁcientalternative to other fuels. The Ministry of Energy estimates that by the end 0f2018, approximately 18,700 km Ofnaturalgas transpottation infrastructure will be in operation.
TransportationCurrent logistics lag transportation and storage infrastructure, creating a challenge for the implementation ofthe Energy Reform The current pipeline network is completely saturated and vulnerable to short term ﬂuctuations in
supply. The need for signiﬁcant investment in infrastructure will most likely encourage the Mexican government toboost private investment to develop a competitive market,

Mexico has no storage capacity for natural gas, with the exception of that associated with LNG import andregasiﬁcation projects Natural gas storage developers must apply for natural gas storage permits from the MexicanEnergy Regulatory Commission. Growing demand is expected to cause an increase in capacity of fuel supply. As oftoday, the pipeline network has less than seven days’ worth of inventory across the country‘ The Ministry of Energy’srevised storage policy will require up to 15 days ofminimum inventory for key regions, which will require a signiﬁcantincrease in Mexico’s current infrastmcture.
Determining the type of storage facility represents a challenge. The use ofexhausted ﬁelds has been problematicdue to the existence of residual hydrocarbons that can mix with stored natural gas, generating problems withquantiﬁcation and the legality of the “extraction, Fields of non-hydrocarbon resources provide a simpler alternative.
LNG Storage and Regasification Facilities
The substantial rise in demand for natural gas from the CFE and Independent Power Producers has contributedto the increase in total natural gas demand 0f3,879 MMcfd, which represents an increase of 85% compared to 2014.Demand is expected to grow at a 1.2% compound annual growth rate (CAGR) from 2015 to 2030, growing from 7,504MMcfd in 2015 to 9,030 MMcfd in 2030. Domestic demand has outpaced domestic production, resulting in increasednatural gas imports.
In addition to the imports from cross—border pipelines, imports ofLNG have helped satisfy the growing demandfor natural gas Three LNG regassiﬁcation terminals have been granted the required permits since September 2003,when the Energy Regulatory Commission ﬁrst issued the technical regulations pertaining to LNG storage andregasiﬁcation plants The Company owns around 50% of the capacity of all companies in the LNG regasiﬁcation sectoras ofDecember 2017.

Natural Gas Marketing
In July 2016, the Ministry of Energy published the Public Policy for the Implementation of the Natural GasMarket, which aims to encourage market development, contribute to the country’s energy security and maintaincontinuity of supply in order to achieve a competitive natural gas market by 20181 As part of the new policy, Pemexwill have to reduce its market share in the next four years, to 30%, in order to limit its dominant position and allow forother marketers to compete effectively, The Energy Regulatory Commission implemented Pemex’s Gas release programwith the strategic goal ofreleasing 70% of Pemex's current contracts to the market. The contracts will be released inthree phases The ﬁrst phase, completed in 2017, released 20% 0f Pemex’ gas contracts to marketers,
The Energy Regulatory Commission has achieved important advances in the implementation of a permanentscheme for the sale of natural gas. The scheme is expected to allow all natural gas players to purchase natural gasdirectly from the Pemex processing plant or at cross-border import points, thereby ending the lengthy transitionalscheme in which the majority of consumers (except for IPPs) had to purchase natural gas and related transportationservices through Pemex TRI, Pursuant to the new Hydrocarbons Law, the Energy Regulatory Commission will issuemarketing permits for the sale of natural gas
Transportation of Liquid Petroleum Products
Despite the growing demand for reﬁned products throughout the country, Mexico lacks efﬁcient transportation,distribution and storage infrastructure for liquid petroleum products While trucks and ships continue to provide asigniﬁcant percentage of reﬁned petroleum transportation, there are increasing opportunities to provide more efﬁcienttransportation to reach growing demand at consumption centers, According to the Ministry of Energy Oil and ReﬁnedProducts Prospect 2017-2031, from 2017 to 2031, the demand for gasoline and diesel for the auto transport sector willgrow at a CAGR of 14% and 2.3%, respectively, This scenario represents a potential investment opportunity in liquidpetroleum transportation and storage infrastructure
Before the recent energy reform, Pemex had exclusivity on certain activities such as processing, storage,transportation, distribution and marketing of petroleum products.
The energy reform allows private sector participation in the construction and operation ofoil product storageand transportation facilities‘ As the liberalization of reﬁned products prices and imports continues gradually through2018, the Company expects that suppliers and distributors of new reﬁned products will require additional infrastructureto satisfy the demands of consumers This trend has become evident in 2017, as international reﬁning and marketingcompanies have made announcements about beginning direct sales to consumers in several regions, with brands thatare new to Mexican fuel consumers.
Liberalization of gasoline and diesel prices be gan during 2016, and was completed in January 2018. The priceofLPG was fully liberalized in January 2017.

LPG Market
Current Mexican regulations allow private—sector investment in LPG transportation, distribution and storage.The distribution market is dominated by a very small group ofparticipants, with substantial entry barriers.
Overall, the Company believes the LPG sector will likely require greater efﬁciency (or greater capacity atcurrent efﬁciency levels) in order to supply the growing energy demand in Mexico, LPG transportation and storageinfrastwcture are two of the areas in need of modernization, given the inefﬁcient extended truck transportation systemwidely used today, Given the current state of Mexico's LPG transportation and storage infrastructure and future expectedmarket conditions, the Company believes it is necessary to develop a strategy for increasing the transportation andstorage capacity in southeastern Mexico and in the largest consumption centers, to ensure an adequate supply of LPGand achieve increased transportation ﬂexibility.

Before energy reform, private participation was permitted only in non-public service activities, such as IPPand self-supply. As a result of Mexican energy reform, the private sector in Mexico, subject to certain regilations, isallowed to participate in most of the electricity industry production chain. The private sector can participate in theconstruction and operation of power plants and compete with the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission in thewholesale market. Although transmission and distribution of electric energy will be controlled by the Mexican state,the private sector can participate in these activities through service contracts. Electricity retail (for small and mediumsize customers) will remain an activity exclusive to the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission, while qualiﬁed users(large customers with more than 1 MW of demand) may purchase electric energy from any power generator througha regulated wholesale electric market.

Following the successful award of several constructions, lease and transfer contracts in the mid-nineties, in1997 sundry legislative reforms were approved, allowing the CFE to call for bids on independent production plantprojects, Beginning with the nationalization of the electric energy industry in 1960, and until the legislative reforms of1992, the CFE was the only authority authorized to generate electric energy in Mexico,
The reforms of 1992 allowed the Independent Power Producers to participate in the construction, ﬁnancing,operation, ownership and maintenance of electric energy generation plants, which had to meet cenain technical andquality requirements, The energy generated by the Independent Power Producers is intended exclusively for sale to theCFE under long-term, ﬁxed-price electricity generation contracts.
At the end ofDecember 2016, total electricity generation was 319 GWh, 3.2% higher than the previous year.Similar growth was seen in conventional energy (3.2%) and in clean energy (3%), which was mainly due to windgeneration growth (19.6%) and solar (104.6%), From the total generation infrastructure, 54.6% were owned by CFE,17.6% were private parties and the remaining was Independent Power Producers (278%),
At the end of 2017, the Energy Regulatory Commission had 1,318 energy generation permits. Of these, 864permits were granted under the former law and 445 under the new law (163 of CFE), which depicts the attractivenessof the Mexican electricity market. Increasing power generation capacity has also attracted investment in transmissionlines and substations.

Prior to energy reform, besides the Independent Energy Producer program, private industry could participatein cogeneration, self-supply, imports, expons and low-level production (that is, the generation of less than 30 MW ofelectric energy for sale to CFE or for exportation) All electric energy generation projects require a permit from theEnergy Regulatory Commission, with the understanding that their electric energy generation capacity must be 05 MWor greater. These contracts are known as legacy contracts because they are regulated under the former regime, with theoption to preserve their rights and obligations or to adopt the new regime partially or totally,

As of the end of 2017, three long—term wholesale electricity market auctions took place. CENACE awarded 20.6million clean energy certiﬁcates, 198 million MWH of energy and 18 GW ofcapacity, which represents an investmentUSD$9 billion between 2016 and 2020. The contracts have a 15-year term for capacity and energy, and a 20-year termfor clean energy certiﬁcates. From these energy generation power plants will help to meet the goal of 35% clean energygeneration in 2024.
Sources of renewable energy
In recent years, Mexico has strived to develop and promote the use of non-fossil fuels and to further thedevelopment of a more varied energy matrix. Modiﬁcations to the energy regulation framework that were approvedby the Mexican Congress in October 2008 included the Renewable Energy Use Law and the Financing of the EnergyTransition. This law was superseded by the Energy Transition Law (LTE) that was published on December 24, 2015.The objective of this new law is to regulate the use of sustainable energy, to establish the obligations involved in cleanenergy and reduce the discharge of contaminants to the atmosphere from the electric industry. In the long run, the useof renewable energy can help balance the country’s electric energy portfolio and reduce its dependence on inputs thatare subject to high price volatility. The LTE provides that by 2018, at least 25% of the electric energy in Mexico shallbe generated by clean sources, reaching 30% in 2021 and 35% in 2024. In addition, as the government implements therequired incentives and applicable regulations, it creates new investment opportunities.
Mexico has a wide variety oftenewable sources ofenergy, including wind, geothermic, solar and hydroelectricenergy. The country is especially rich in wind and solar resources. The Mexican Wind Energy Association estimatesthat since 2004, the country has invested approximately USD$6.9 billion, in wind energy. This has created 3,527 MWof capacity, which is expected to grow by 12,000 MW between 2020 and 2022.
In 2016, renewable energy sources were 28.8% of Mexico’s installed electric energy generation capacity,which represents an increase of1012% from 2015 to 20161

The 1992 energy reform allowed, for the ﬁrst time, private industry participation in the constmction andoperation ofplants using renewable energy. However, the use of this type ofenergy has stagnated in comparison withthat of fossil fuel. This is due in part to the absence of an integral infrastmcture capable ofovercoming the large numberofexisting obstacles, such as complicated land use permits, insufﬁcient transmission infrastructure and cost advantagesthat prevented the CFE from buying electricity at higher prices.
Finally, in 2012, the Senate unanimously approved the General Climate Change Law, establishing the obligationthat, by 2024, at least 35% of the electric energy produced in Mexico be generated from non—fossil fuel sources Thisobjective has been ratiﬁed by the LTE. This law turned Mexico into the second country in the world —trailing only theUnited Kingdomi to adopt obligatory weather—oriented policies. The private companies in the best position to takeadvantage 0fthese trends will be able to post major growth levels as the country’s electric energy requirements continueto grow and the country adopts a clean technology regimen.
Conceming energy reform, certain obligations for the use of clean energy became applicable to the players inthe electric energy market, Clean energy certiﬁcates, or CELs, will be issued to “clean energy generating companies”,The electric energy generators may receive a clean energy credit for each MW/hri generated in clean energy plantsThese certiﬁcates will be negotiated through the wholesale electricity market, long»term bilateral contracts and in thespot market Starting 2018, the use of clean energy is mandatory; the Ministry of Energy has established that at least5% of energy used must come from clean energy sources and that the deﬁcit be compensated by CELs, In addition,the Ministry of Energy has provided that by 2019, at least 518% of energy must come from clean energy sources andthe deﬁcit be compensated by CELs. By 2020, at least 7.4% of energy must come from clean energy sources and thedeﬁcit be compensated by CELs, By 2021, at least 109% of energy must come from clean energy sources and thedeﬁcit be compensated by CELs. By 2022, at least 139% of energy must come from clean energy sources and thedeﬁcit be compensated by CELs,
In addition, the LTE opened the possibility for large consumers to sign voluntary contracts with the Ministry,through the National Commission for Efﬁcient Energy Use, to reduce the intensity of the energy in their activities. TheLTE has also created a voluntary certiﬁcation mechanism known as “Excellence in Energy Efﬁciency” to identify andpromote products to make energy use sustainable and efﬁcient
F urthermore, the CF E contemplates holding auctions for the development and operation 0ftransmissi0n linesunder long—tenn contracts, creating electricity interconnections with North and Central America, and contemplatinginvestments estimated at more than USD$11.0 billion to modernize the electric energy transmission network duringthe next 15 years.
The growth of the national natural gas and electric energy sectors
The SENER and the CENACE believe that electricity demand will continue to grow by an annual average of3% between 2017 and 2031 and the present infrastructure is still insufﬁcient to meet the country’s ﬁJture requirementsfor electricity supply. Consequently the expansion of gas pipeline systems and energy storage infrastructure will benecessary. To meet these needs, new generation capacity of 56 GW will be required, as well as major investments intransmission and distribution. An average annual investment of USD$ 7.0 billion per year is expected.

According to the Natural Gas Prospect for 2017-2031, in 2016 the demand for natural gas was 7.6 MMcfd.By 2031, the demand for natural gas will be 9.7 MMcfd, which represents an increase of 26.8% from 2016, with anexpected average annual increase of 1.6%.
In addition, during the next 15 years, national electric energy demand is forecasted to reach a compound annualgrowth rate of 3.0%, and the maximum demand in the interconnected system is expected to grow 3% nationally, 2.8%in Baja California Norte and 3.9% in Baja California Sur.
The increased use now poses a challenge to Mexico. The Company feels that the construction of new gaspipeline infrastructure, the construction of a new capacity for importing natural gas, and/or the expansion of the presentcapacity are indispensable to the country’s short- and medium-term economic development, and that in the ﬁnal analysisthey create opportunities for the players in this industry.
The Company foresees that the introduction Ofnatural gas infrastructure will foster the growth of new industriesand will represent an opportunity for additional gas pipeline expansion and the diversiﬁcation of its customer base.
Industry Outlook
Mexico has abundant reserves of petroleum and natural gas, yet strong economic growth is causing energydemand to outpace the country’s ability to generate additional supply. Historical under—investment in exploration andproduction has limited supply, and budgetary constraints related to major projects such as natural gas pipelines,transmission lines, and power plants have hindered the development of energy infrastructure.
The Company anticipates that current macroeconomic dynamics in Mexico will create signiﬁcant opportunitiesfor growth in the energy infrastructure sector over the next several years as demand for energy resources continues togrow,
According to the Mexican Energy Ministry in its Five-Year Plan for the Expansion of the National NaturalGas Integrated Transportation and Storage System, 2015-2019, over the next ﬁve years Mexico will build additional

pipelines with an aggregate length of 5,519 km, which will require an aggregate investment of approximately USD$9.7 billion.
Regulatory Outlook
In Mexico, both the natural gas and power sectors are regulated and include a high level of participation bythe Mexican government. In the power segment, until the recent amendment of the legal framework for the regulationofthe Mexican energy sector, the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission was a decentralized agency ofthe Mexicangovernment and was responsible for all planning activities relating to the Mexican power grid and for generating,transmitting, distributing and selling electricity in Mexico. As a result of such amendment, the Mexican FederalElectricity Commission is now an independently-managed company that is 100% owned by the Mexican Government,In addition, under the new legal framework the Mexican government, through the newly created Mexican Center forthe Control of Electrical Energy, has exclusive control over the Mexican power grid and all related planning activities,The Mexican Center for the Control of Electrical Energy also serves as an independent system operator of the Mexicanwholesale electricity markets
In the natural gas segment, Pemex (together with its subsidiaries, including Pemex TRI) has also become anindependent company that is 100% owned by the Mexican Government The amendment of the legal framework forthe regulation of the Mexican energy sector was intended primarily to allow Pemex to focus on proﬁtable explorationand production activities while attracting foreign investment, and to allow Pemex to stimulate the whole energy industryfrom upstream to retail distribution: oil and gas as well as power and utilities.
The legislative changes that took place in Mexico in the 1990s created signiﬁcant investment opportunitiesforthe private sector from 1995, when regulatory reform allowedprivate sectorparticipation in the natural gas midstream(storage and transportation) and downstream (retail distribution) sectors,
In the power segment, since the nationalization of the Mexican electricity industry in 1960 until 1992, theMexican Federal Electricity Commission had been solely responsible for power generation in Mexico The 1992 reformsand 1997 legislation allowed IPPs to build and operate power generation plants for self-consumption or to export theelectricity generated or sell it to the Mexican F ederal Electricity Commission under long-term agreements at ﬁxedprices. IPPs operate under long-term (typically 25-year) build-own-operate contracts A majority of IPPs receive theirnatural gas supply from the Mexican Federal Electricity Commission under long-term contracts that match theiroperating term. The recently enacted Mexican Law for the Electricity Industry allows the private sector to generateand market electricity, subject to the receipt of a permit under a regulated open market. See “Legal Framework andTaxation.”
Natural Gas and Power Demand Outlook
The CFE power plants generated 54.7% of the electricity in 201 6, The Independent Power Producers generated278% and the remaining 175% was contributed by private electricity generators such as self-supply, cogeneration,small production, exports, own continuous use, Distributed Generation and non-interconnected rural systems reportedby Shared Risk Trust Fund. In Mexico, the combined cycle is the predominant electricity generation technology, Thereare currently 71 power plants with a total installed capacity 0f27,274 MW, equivalent to 37% ofthe national installedcapacity. The electricity generated in 2016 reached 160,378 GWh, which represented 50% 0f the electrical generationof the country in that year,
Based on the expected progress in the generation of electricity, the natural gas consumption will increase atan average annual rate 0f2,7%, so by 2031 it will reach 60% of the total consumption of fossil fuels required for theproduction Ofelectricity. From 2017 to 2021 a more dynamic growth of natural gas consumption is expected, derivedfrom the incorporation of 83 GW Ofcombined cycle projects that will be fully operational by 2020, representing 44%0fthe total additional capacity ofthis technology to be installed in the period from 2017 to 2031, Once the 14 gaspipelines in the national network that are currently under construction and estimated to start commercial operation in2018 are placed in service, the natural gas transport capacity will increase annually by 12,681 mmcfd.
