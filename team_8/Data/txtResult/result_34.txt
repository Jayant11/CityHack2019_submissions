- Negotiable debt securities (“NDS”) having a residual life upon acquisition that is less than orequal to 3 months are assessed with a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of thedifference between the acquisition value and the redemption value, The management companynevertheless reserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case ofparticular sensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalentsecurity issues allocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
- NDS, of which the residual lifespan at acquisition is greater than 3 months but of which theresidual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is equal to or less than 3 months, are assessedby means of a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of the difference between the lastadopted current value and the reimbursement value The management company neverthelessreserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case of particularsensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
— NDS, of which the residual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is greater than 3 months,are assessed at their current values The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer,
- Firm future ﬁnancial instruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the clearing priceon the day before the calculation day of the net asset value. Conditional future financialinstruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the market value on the day of the netasset value. Over-the-counter ﬁrm or conditional future ﬁnancial instruments are assessed at theprice given by the ﬁnancial instrument's counterparty, They are presented in the off-balancesheet on the basis of the nominal value defined in the contract.
In the event of the holding of an EMTN, it will be valued on the basis of a market price given bythe ﬁnancial instrument’s counterparty. The management company independently carries out averiﬁcation of this assessment.
- Deposits are assessed at their nominal value, plus any related interest that has accrued.
— Subscription warrants, cash certiﬁcates, promissory notes and mortgage notes are assessed attheir probable market value, under the management company’s responsibility,

Benchmark Indicator publication
The ofﬁcial MSCI indices are calculated continuously from 9.00 am to 530 pm (Paris time) for which MSCI calculatesa closing price using the ofﬁcial closing prices of the constituent stocks.
The Benchmark Indicator is also calculated in real time every stock exchange trading day. The Benchmark Indicator isavailable Via Reuters and Bloomberg.
Reuters code: .MIEU00000NEUBloomberg code: M7EUThe Benchmark Indicator's closing price is available on the MSCI Internet site: www,msci,com,
Benchmark Indicator revision and composition
The Benchmark Indicator is rebalanced quarterly to comply with the objective of representing 85% of the adjustedmarket capitalisation of each country and industry group and to account for any developments that may affect a stock'smarket capitalisation (such as the number of shares outstanding and free ﬂoat) or its sector classification. The principal
changes in a company's capital structure may be implemented in real time (merger or acquisition, large rights issues orIP05).
The MSCI rules for Benchmark Indicator revision are published by MSCI and are available on the Internet site:www.msci.com.
The rebalaneing frequency indicated above does not affect the cost of implementing the Investment Strategy.
Investment strategy:
1. Strategy employedThe MF will comply with the investment rules dictated by the European Directive n0. 2009/65/EC dated 13 July 2009.
In pursuit of the greatest possible correlation with the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, the MF will employ anindirect replication method, which means that it will enter into one or more OTC swap contracts enabling it to achieveits investment objective, These swap contracts will serve to exchange (i) the value of the MF’s assets, which will consistof cash and/or balance sheet assets (excluding any securities received as collateral), for (ii) the value of the securitiesthat underlie the Benchmark Indicator.
The securities held as assets by the MF may notably be securities that make up the Benchmark Indicator, as well asother international equities, from all economic sectors, listed on all markets, including the small caps markets,
The basket of assets held may be adjusted daily such that its value will generally be at least 100% of the net assets,When necessary, this adjustment will be made to ensure that the counterparty risk arising from the aforementioned swapcontract will be entirely neutralized.
Information relative to (i) the updated composition of the basket of the balance sheet assets held in the MF’s portfolioand (ii) the market value of the future exchange operation entered into by the MF are available on the page dedicated tothe MF 0n the Internet site www.lyxoretfcom, The update frequency and/or the update date of the aforesaidinformation is also indicated on the same page of the aforesaid Internet site.
The MP will invest permanently at least of 75% of its assets in companies that have their head office in a Member Stateof the European Union or in another State that is a party to the treaty 0n the European Economic Area and that hassigned with France a tax agreement containing an administrative assistance clause for the purposes of combating fraudor tax evasion, This minimum holding level provides for eligibility for a Stock Savings Plan,
As part of the management of its exposure, the MF can use up to 20% of its assets to acquire equities from a singleissuing entity. This 20% limit can be increased to 35% for a single issuing entity when this proves to be justified byexceptional conditions within the market, notably when certain securities are heavily dominant and/or in the event ofhigh volatility of a financial instrument and of securities from an economic sector represented by the BenchmarkIndicator, in particular in the event of a public offering affecting one of the securities making up the BenchmarkIndicator or in the event of a signiﬁcant restriction of liquidity affecting one or more ﬁnancial instruments making upthe Benchmark Indicator.
2. Balance sheet assets {excluding integrated derivatives[
The MF may hold, in compliance with the ratios contained in the regulation, international equities (from all economicsectors, listed on all markets) including the small capitalisation markets.
The aforementioned equities will be chosen on the basis of criteria:- of eligibility, in particular:Subordination to the main market indices or to the Benchmark Indicator,Liquidity (minimal thresholds applied to mean daily volumes of transactions and t0 the equity market capitalisation),0 Rating of the country of the issuer’s head office (requirement of a minimal threshold in S&P rating or equivalent),- of diversification, notably:

When the MF receives collateral in the form of securities, subject to the terms of section 8 below, it acquires full title tothese securities and they are therefore included among the balance sheet assets to which it has full title‘ As part of thefuture optimisation of the MF’s management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments within the limitsof the regulations in order to achieve the management objective.
3. Off-balance sheet assets {derivative instruments[
The MF will have recourse to index—linked swaps traded over—the-counter, exchanging the value of the MF's assets (orof any other ﬁnancial instrument or asset held by the MF, where appropriate) against the value of the BenchmarkIndicator (as described in part 1 of this section)‘
As part of a future optimisation of the MF management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments withinthe limits of the regulations, such as to achieve the management objective, for example including future financialinstruments other than index-linked swaps.
In compliance with its best execution policy, the management company considers that the Société Générale is thecounterparty that generally makes it possible to obtain the best possible result with these future ﬁnancial instruments,These future ﬁnancial instruments (including index-linked swaps) can therefore be traded with the Société Generale,without prior open competition involving several counterparties.
The counterparty 0f the aforesaid future ﬁnancial instruments (the “‘Counterparty”) will have no discretionary powerregarding the composition of the MF’s investment portfolio, nor regarding the underlying assets of the future financialinstruments,

In all cases in which the MF is subject to a counterparty risk as a result of the deployed investment strategy, notably inthe event of the MF’s use of forward swap contracts traded over the counter, the MF can receive securities that areconsidered as guarantees in order to reduce the counterparty risk related to these operations. The portfolio of receivedguarantees can be adjusted each day in order for its value to be greater than or equal to the level of the counterparty riskborne by the MF in most cases. The objective of this adjustment will be to ensure that the level of counterparty riskborne by the MF is totally neutralized.
The manager is prohibited from receiving cash guarantees.
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF will be provided to the MP in full ownership and listed in the MF’s accountopened in the books of its depositary. As such, the received ﬁnancial guarantees will be listed amongst the MF’s assets.
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF within this framework must comply with the criteria deﬁned by theprevailing laws and regulations, notably in terms of liquidity, valuation, credit quality of the issuers, correlation, risksrelated to the management of securities, and applicability. The received guarantees must, in particular, comply with thefollowing conditions:
(a) Any received guarantee must be of high quality, very liquid and traded on a regulated market or in a multilateraltrading system with transparent pricing, in order to be sold quickly at a price close to the prior valuation;
(b) They must be valued at least on a daily basis and assets showing strong price volatility must not be accepted asguarantee except in case of the application of a sufficiently cautious discount;
(c) They must be issued by an entity that is independent of the counterparty and must not be highly correlated with thecounterparty's performances;

The MF is exposed to the risk of bankruptcy, payment default or any other type of default of every counterparty withwhich it has entered into a contract or transaction. It is particularly exposed to the counterparty risk resulting from itsuse of FFI traded over»the-counter with Société Générale or with any other counterparty. In compliance with the UCITSregulations, the counterparty risk (whether this counterparty is the Société Générale or any other entity) cannot exceed10% 0f the total value of the MF's assets per counterparty.
In case of a Counterparty’s default, the contract relating to FFIs can be terminated early. The MF will then make everyeffort to achieve its management objective by signing, if relevant, another contract relating to FFIs with a third partycounterparty, under the market conditions prevailing at the time of the occurrence of this event.
The realisation of this risk can notably have impacts on the MF’s ability to achieve its management objective, inparticular the replication of the Benchmark Indicator.
When Société Générale is involved as a counterparty of the FFIs, conﬂicts of interest can arise between the MF’sManagement Company and the FFI’s counterparty. The Management Company manages these conﬂict of interest risksby setting up procedures intended to identify and limit them, and to ensure their equitable resolution, if relevant,
- Risk that the management objective may only be partially achieved
Nothing guarantees that the management objective will be achieved. Indeed, n0 asset or financial instrument will allowan automatic and continuous replication of the Benchmark Indicator, notably should one or more of the following risksarise:
- Risk related to the use of derivative instruments

In order to achieve its investment objective, the MF uses FFI traded over—the-counter, that can notably take the form ofswap contracts that will allow it to obtain the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, These FFIs can result in a seriesof risks on the level of the FFIs that notably include: counterparty risk, event affecting the hedging, event affecting theBenchmark Indicator, risk related to the tax regime, risk related to the regulations, operational risk and liquidity risk,These risks can directly affect a FFI and can result in the adjustment or early termination of the FFI transaction, whichcoul affect the MF‘s net asset value.
— Ris relate to a change of the tax regime
Any change to the tax legislation in any of the countries in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing orliste can affect the tax treatment of the investors In this case, the MF’s manager assumes no liability relative toinvestors with regard to the payments having to be made to any competent tax authority.
— Ris relate to a change of the tax regime affecting the underlyings

Any change of the tax legislation applicable to the MF’s underlyings can affect the MF's tax treatment, Consequently,in case of divergence between the anticipated tax treatment and the one actually applied to the MF (and/or to itscounterparty in the FFI), the MF’s net asset value may be affected.
- Ris relatec to regulations
In case of change of the regulations in any country in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing or listed,the processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units may be affected.
- Ris relatec to the regulations agplicable to the underlyings

In case of change of the regulations applicable to the MF‘s underlyings, the MF‘s net asset value can be affected, as canthe processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units.
— Ris relate to events affecting the Benchmark Indicator
In case of events affecting the Benchmark Indicator, the manager may, under the conditions and limits of the applicablelegis ation, have to suspend the subscription and redemption of MF units. The calculation of the MF’s net asset valuecan also be a fected.


If the event persists, the MF’s manager will decide on measures having to be adopted, which can have an impact on theMF’s net asset value. “Events affecting the Benchmark Indicator” are understood to mean the following situations:
i) The Benchmark Indicator is considered to be incorrect or not reﬂective of the market’s actual evolution,ii) The Benchmark Indicator is definitively discontinued by the supplier of the index,iii) The supplier of the index is incapable of providing the level or value of the Benchmark Indicator,

935824 7 Annual report — Fiscal year ending on: 31.01.2017
===================================================

iv) The supplier of the index makes a signiﬁcant Change to the formula or calculation method of the BenchmarkIndicator (other than a minor modiﬁcation such as the adjustment of the underlyings used with this BenchmarkIndicator or of the respective weightings between its various components), that cannot be effectively replicated by theMF at a reasonable cost.
V) One or more components of the Benchmark Indicator becomes non-liquid, with the listing being suspended on anorganised market, or components traded over-the-counter (such as bonds, for example) become non-liquid,
Vi) The Benchmark Indicator’s components are impacted by transaction fees relative to the execution, delivery versuspayment or specific ﬁscal constraints, without these fees being reﬂected in the Benchmark Indicator’s performance.
- Securities transaction risk
Should the issuer of a security underlying the Benchmark Indicator undertake an unanticipated review of a securitiestransaction (“ST), that contradicts a prior and ofﬁcial announcement that had resulted in a valuation of the ST by theMF (and/or in a valuation of the ST by the MF’s counterparty in a future ﬁnancial instrument), the MF’s net asset valuemay be affected, notably should the actual treatment of the ST by the MF differ from the ST’s treatment in themethodology used by the Benchmark Indicator.
- Exchange risk linked to the Benchmark Indicator
The MF is exposed to the exchange risk insofar as the underlying securities comprising the Benchmark Indicator maybe listed in a currency other than the currency of the Benchmark Indicator or be derived from securities listed in acurrency other than the currency of the index, The ﬂuctuations of exchange rates could therefore negatively affect theBenchmark Indicator followed by the MF,
— Exchange risk linked to the class of units USD (EUR/USD) GBP (EUR/GBP), CHF (EUR/CHF)
The abovementioned class of units is exposed to an exchange risk to the extent that it is listed in a currency other thanthat of the Benchmark Indicator. The net asset value of the abovementioned class of units can therefore decrease due toﬂuctuating exchange rates even though the value of the Benchmark Indicator has increased.

Subscribers concerned and typical investor proﬁle:The MF is “open to any subscriber”.An investor subscribing to this MF wishes to obtain an exposure to the European equity markets.
The amount that it is reasonable to invest in this MF depends on your personal situation. To determine this amount, youmust take into account your personal wealth and/or estate, cash requirements at the present and for five years, but alsoyour desire to take risks or, on the contrary, to prefer a cautious investment.
