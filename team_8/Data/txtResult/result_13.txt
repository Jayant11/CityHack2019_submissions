Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
How the matter was addressed in our auditWe performed the following audit procedures, among others:
. We assessed the appropriateness of using value in use (“VlU”) as the basis for determining the CGUs' recoverable amount andchecked the mathematical accuracy of the cash flow model used to estimate VIU.
- We evaluated the Group’s future cash flow model by performing retrospective assessment of the accuracy of the projections,disaggregating and understanding the underlying business units' cash flow projections, including comparing the inputs to thebusiness’ own forecast. including revenue growth and EBITDA margin, to the latest internal board approved budget and plan,external market data and our understanding of the future prospects of the business or investment.
- We worked with our own valuation specialists to challenge the discount rates and long»term growth rates, and comparing theseassumptions to external market data.
- We performed our own sensitivity of the impairment calculation to changes in the key assumptions used by the Group.- We also assessed the adequacy of key assumptions disclosure in the Group’s financial statements.
We have determined that there is no key audit matter in the audit of the separate financial statements of the Company to communicatein our auditors' report.

Equity price risk
Equity price risk mainly arises from the Group’s investment in quoted equity securities classified as availabIe-for—salefinancial instruments
The equity investments are held for long term strategic purposes. Their performance is assessed periodically togetherwith assessment if their relevance to the Group’s long term strategic plans‘
As at 31 December 2016, it is estimated that an increase/(decrease) of 10% in the market price of the quoted equitysecurities, with all other variables held constant, would have increased/(decreased) the Group’s equity byRM117,664,000.

Hedging activitiesCash ﬂow hedge
The Group has entered into interest rate swaps to hedge the cash flow risk in relation to the floating interest rate of somebank loans. As at 31 December 2017, the Group had interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps withnominal value of RM1,023,701,000 and RM382,719,000 respectively (2016: RM1,573.519.000 and RM233,574.000). Detailsof the cash flow of the interest rate swaps are shown in Note 37(iv).
As at 31 December 2017, where the interest rate swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps were designated as hedginginstruments in qualifying cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the changes in fair value of the swaps amounting toRM731,000 gain (2016: RM7,850,000 loss) was recognised in other comprehensive income (see Note 31).
During the year, where hedge accounting was discontinued, not practised or ineffective, the changes in fair value ofinterest rate swaps amounting to RM815,000 loss (2016: RM1,900,000 gain) was charged to profit or loss. Accordingly, thechanges in fair value of these interest rate swaps, previously recognised in the hedge reserve amounting to RM2,429,000loss (2016: RM1,253,000 loss) were reclassiﬁed to proﬁt or 1055‘
Hedge of net investments in a foreign operation
The Group's Japanese Yen denominated unsecured bank loans has been designated as a natural hedge of the Group’snet investments in Japan. In 2014, the Group refinanced a Japanese Yen denominated loan with a Singapore Dollardenominated loan which was overlaid with a cross currency interest rate swaps to realign this SGD borrowing into aneffective Japanese Yen loan to maintain as a natural hedge for its foreign investment in Japan. The carrying value of theseJapanese denominated loan and Japanese medium term notes as at end of financial year was RM1,380,933,000 (2016:RM1,360,992,000).
Foreign exchange gain of RM21,344,000 (2016: RM81,492,000 loss) was recognised in other comprehensive income withrespect to the effective portion of the hedge.
Fair value information
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, short term receivables and payables reasonably, approximate theirfairvalues due to the relatively short term of nature of these financial instruments.
It is not practicable to reliably estimate the fair value of put option, unquoted equity shares, club membership and otherinvestments due to the lack ofquoted market prices in an active market, significant range of reasonable fairvalue estimates,and the inability to reasonably assess the probabilities of the various estimates.

Fair value information (continued)
Policy on transfer between Ie vels
The fair value of an asset to be transferred between levels is determined as of the date of the event or change incircumstances that caused the transfer.
Level 1 fair value
Leve|1fair value is derived from quoted price (unadjusted) in active markets for identical financial assets or liabilities thatthe entity can access at the measurement date.
Quoted investments
The fairvalue ofﬁnancial assets at fair value through profit or loss and available-for—sale financial instruments is determinedby reference to their quoted closing bid prices at the end of the ﬁnancial year.
Fixed rate medium term notes
The fair values of fixed rate medium term notes are determined by reference to their quoted closing bid price at the end ofthe financial year,
Level 2 fair value
Level 2 fair value is estimated using inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for thefinancial assets or liabilities either directly or indirectly.
Derivative, eurobonds and money market funds
The fair value of foreign exchange forward contracts, cross currency interest rate swaps, interest rate swaps, eurobondsand money market funds are based on banker quotes‘
Transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 fair values
There has been no transfer between Level 1 and Level 2 fair values during the financial year (2016: no transfer in eitherdirection).
Level 3 fair valueLevel 3 fair value is estimated using unobservable inputs for the ﬁnancial assets and liabilities.
Derivatives
Call option granted to non-controlling interests are stated at fair value and valued using the Black Scholes model, The keyassumptions used include risk-adjusted discount rate, dividend yield and volatility.
Non»derivative ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
CCPS liabilities are stated at fair value based on the subsidiary's equity value computed mainly using the discounted cashflow method based on present value of projected free cash flows of the subsidiary discounted using a riskeadjusteddiscount rate.
Put options granted to nonecontrolling interest are stated at fair value based on the subsidiary's equity value describedabove and the discounted cash flow method based on presentvalue of expected payment discounted using a risk-adjusteddiscount rate.
Fair value of other non-derivative financial assets and liabilities, which is determined for disclosure purposes. is calculatedbased on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the endof the financial yeart For finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT
to the Members of |HH Healthcare Berhad (Company No. 901914—V)(incorporated in Malaysia) (continued)
Report on the Audit of the Financial Statements (continued)
Auditors’ Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company as awhole are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditors’ report that includes our opinion.Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance. but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with approvedstandards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing will always detect a material misstatement when it exists.Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably beexpected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with approved standards on auditing in Malaysia and International Standards on Auditing, weexercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout the audit We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, whether dueto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient andappropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higherthan for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or theoverride of internal controlt
. Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in orderto design audit procedures that are appropriate in thecircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the internal control of the Group and ofthe Company.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relateddisclosures made by the Directors,
. Conclude on the appropriateness ofthe Directors' use ofthe going concern basis ofaccounting and, based on the audit evidenceobtained. whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the ability of theGroup or of the Company to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required todraw attention in our auditors’ report to the related disclosures in the financial statements of the Group and of the Company or,if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to thedate of our auditors' report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group or the Company to cease to continue asa going concern
. Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements of the Group and of the Company, includingthe disclosures, and whether the financial statements of the Group and of the Company represent the underlying transactionsand events in a manner that gives a true and fair view.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activities within theGroup to express an opinion on the financial statements of the Group, We are responsible for the direction, supervision andperformance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the Directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant auditfindings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the Directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence,and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, andwhere applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the Directors, we determine those matters that were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of thefinancial statements ofthe Group and of the Company for the current year and are therefore the key audit matters. We describe thesematters in our auditors’ report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rarecircumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our auditors’ report because the adverse consequences ofdoing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.

MFRS 15, Revenue from Contracts with Customers
MFRS 15 replaces the guidance in MFRS 111, Construction Contracts, MFRS 118, Revenue, IC Interpretation 13, CustomerLoyalty Programmes. [C Interpretation 15, Agreements for Construction of Real Estate. [C Interpretation 18, Transfers ofAssets from Customers and IC Interpretation 131, Revenue — Barter Transactions Involving Advertising Services

MFRS 9, Financial Instruments
MFRS 9 replaces the guidance in MFRS 139, Financial Instruments: Recognition andMeasurement on the classification andmeasurement of financial assets and financial liabilities, and on hedge accounting.
In respect of impairment of financial assets, MFRS 9 replaces the “incurred loss model in MFRS 139 with an “expectedcredit loss“ (“ECL”) model, The new impairment model applies to financial assets measured at amortised cost, contractassets and debt investments measured at fair value through other comprehensive income, but not to investments in equityinstruments.

Basis of consolidation
(i) Businesscombinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method from the acquisition date, which is the date onwhich control is transferred to the Group.
For new acquisitions, the Group measures the cost of goodwill at the acquisition date as:
- the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus
- the recognised amount of any non—controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
- if the business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less- the net fair value 0fthe identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumedt
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
For each business combination, the Group elects whether it measures the non7controlling interests in the acquiree eitherat fair value or at the proportionate share of the acquiree’s identiﬁable net assets at the acquisition date.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the issue ofdebtorequitysecurities,that the Group incurs in connectionwith a business combination are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration isclassified as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes inthe fairvalue of the contingent consideration are recognised in profit or loss.

(iv)
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidatedfinancial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity andhas the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. Potential voting rights are considered whenassessing control only when such rights are substantive, The Group also considers it has de facto power over an investeewhen, despite not having the majority of voting rights, it has the current ability to direct the activities of the investee thatsignificantly affect the investee's return.
The accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group
Investments in subsidiaries are measured in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any impairmentlosses and includes transaction costs
AssociatesAssociates are entities, in which the Group has significant inﬂuence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies.
Investments in associates are accounted for in the consolidated financial statements using the equity method less anyimpairment losses. The cost of the investment includes transaction costs. The consolidated financial statements includethe Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the associates, after adjustments if any, to alignthe accounting policies with those of the Group, from the date that significant inﬂuence commences until the date thatsignificant influence ceases.
When the Group’s share of losses exceeds its interest in an associate, the carrying amount of that interest including anylongeterm investments is reduced to zero, and the recognition of further losses is discontinued except to the extent that theGroup has an obligation to fund the associates operations or has made payments on behalf of the associate.
When the Group ceases to have significant influence over an associate, any retained interest in the former associate at thedate when signiﬁcant influence is lost is measured at fair value and this amount is regarded as the initial carrying amountof a financial asset The difference between the fair value ofany retained interest plus proceeds from the interest disposedof and the carrying amount of the investment at the date when equity method is discontinued is recognised in profit or loss.
When the Group’s interest in an associate decreases but does not result in a loss of significant influence, any retainedinterest is not re-measured. Any gain or loss arising from the decrease in interest is recognised in profit or loss. Any gainsor losses previously recognised in other comprehensive income are also reclassified proportionately to profit or loss
Investments in associates are measured in the Company’s statement of financial position at cost less any impairmentlosses The cost of investment includes transaction costs.
Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are arrangements of which the Group has joint control, established by contracts requiring unanimousconsent for decisions about the activities that significantly affect the arrangements’ returns.
Joint arrangements are classiﬁed and accounted for as follows:
- A joint arrangement is classified as “joint operation when the Group or the Company has rights to the assets andobligations for the liabilities relating to an arrangement. The Group and the Company account for each of its share ofthe assets, liabilities and transactions, including its share of those held or incurred jointly with other investors, inrelation to the joint operationt
- A joint arrangement is classified as “joint venture when the Group or the Company has rights only to the net assetsof the arrangements. The Group accounts for its interest in the joint venture using the equity method. Investments injoint venture are measured in the Company’s statements of financial position at cost less any impairment losses andincludes transaction costs.

Non-controlling interests
Non-controlling interests at the end of the reporting period. being the equity in a subsidian/ not attributable directly orindirectly to equity holders ofthe Company, are presented in the consolidated statement offinancial position and statementof changes in equity within equity. separately from equity attributable to the owners of the Company, Non-controllinginterests in the results of the Group is presented in the consolidated statement of proﬁt or loss and other comprehensiveincome as an allocation of the profit or loss and the comprehensive income for the year between nonecontrolling interestsand owners of the Company‘
Losses applicable to the nonecontrolling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the nonecontrolling interests even if doingso causes the non—controlling interests to have a deficit balances
Changes in non-controlling interests
Changes in the Group’s interest in a subsidiaw that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as transactions withowners in their capacity as owners and therefore no adjustments are made to goodwill. Such changes to non-controllinginterests are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiaw. Any difference between adjustment tononecontrolling interests and the fair value of consideration paid is recognised directly in equity and presented as part ofequity attributable to owners of the Company.
Acquisitions from entities under common control
Business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are under the control of the shareholder thatcontrols the Group are accounted for at the date that common control was established‘
The assets and liabilities acquired under business combinations arising from transfers of interests in entities that are underthe control of the shareholder that controls the Group, are recognised at the carrying amounts recognised previously in theGroup controlling shareholders' consolidated financial statements. The components of equity of the acquired entities areadded to the same components within Group equity and any resulting gain or loss is recognised directly in equity.
Loss of control
Upon the loss of control of a subsidiary, the Group derecognises the assets and liabilities of the subsidiary. any non-controlling interests and the other components of equity related to the subsidiary. Any surplus or deﬁcit arising on the lossof control is recognised in profit or loss.
If the Group retains any interest in the previous subsidiary, then such interest is measured at fair value at the date thatcontrol is lost. Subsequently, it is accounted for as an equity accounted investee or as an availableeforesale financialinstruments depending on the level of influence retained
Transactions eliminated on consolidation
Intraegroup balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and expenses arising from intraegroup transactionsbetween subsidiaries in the Group, are eliminated in preparing the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Unrealised gains arising from transactions with equityeaccounted associates and joint ventures are eliminated against theinvestment to the extent of the Group's interest in the investees. Unrealised losses are eliminated in the same way asunrealised gains, but only to the extent that there is no evidence of impairment.

Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies ofGroup entities at exchange ratesat the dates of the transactions.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the end of the reporting period are retranslated to thefunctional currency at the exchange rate at that date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are not retranslated at the end of the reporting date,except for those that are measured at fair value are retranslated to the functional currency at the exchange rate at the datethat the fair value was determined.
The foreign currency gain or loss on monetaw items is the difference between amortised cost in the functional currencyand the amortised cost in foreign currency translated at the exchange rate at the end ofthe reporting period.
Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for the following differenceswhich are recognised in other comprehensive income arising on the retranslation of:
- availabIe-for-sale equity instruments (except for impairment in which case foreign currency differences that havebeen recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified to profit or loss);
. a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a foreign operation to the extent that the hedge iseffective: or
. qualifying cash flow hedges to the extent the hedge is effective
Foreign operations
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisition, aretranslated to RM at exchange rates at the end of the reporting period‘ The income and expenses of foreign operations aretranslated to RM at exchange rates at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the foreign currencytranslation reserve (“FCTR”) in equity However, if the operation is a non-wholly owned subsidiary, then the relevantproportionate share of the translation difference is allocated to the nonecontrolling interests. When a foreign operation isdisposed of, such that control, significant influence orjoint control is lost, the cumulative amount in the FCTR related to thatforeign operation is reclassified to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposalt
When the Group disposes of only part of its interest in a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the relevant proportionof the cumulative amount is reattributed to non-controlling interestst When the Group disposes ofonly part of its investmentin an associate or joint venture that includes a foreign operation while retaining significant influence or joint control, therelevant proportion of the cumulative amount is reclassified to profit or loss.
In the consolidated financial statements, when settlement of a monetary item receivable from or payable to a foreignoperation is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from such amonetary item are considered to form pan of a net investment in a foreign operation and are recognised in othercomprehensive income, and are presented in the FCTR in equity‘

Initial recognition and measurement
A ﬁnancial asset or a financial liability is recognised in the statement offinancial position when, and only when. the Groupbecomes a pany to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
A financial instrument is recognised initially. at its fair value plus, in the case of a financial instrument not at fair valuethrough profit or loss, transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of the ﬁnancial instrument.
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the statement of ﬁnancial position when, and onlywhen, the Group has a legal right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle on a net basis or to realise the assetand settle the liabilities simultaneouslyl
An embedded derivative is recognised separately from the host contract and accounted for as a derivative if, and only if, itis not closely related to the economic characteristics and risks of the host contract and the host contract is not categorisedas fair value through profit or loss. The host contract, in the event an embedded derivative is recognised separately, isaccounted for in accordance with policy applicable to the nature of the host contract.
Financial instrument categories and subsequent measurementThe Group categorises financial instruments as follows:
Financial assets
(0) Financial assets at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Fair value through profit or loss categon/ comprises financial assets that are held for trading, including derivatives(except for a derivative that is a ﬁnancial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument),contingent consideration receivable in a business combination or financial assets that are specifically designated intothis category upon initial recognition.
Derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of unquoted equity instruments whose fair valuescannot be reliably measured are measured at cost
Other financial assets categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair valueswith the gain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
(b) HeId-to-maturityinvestments
Held-to—maturity investments categow comprises debt instruments that are quoted in an active market and the Grouphas the positive intention and ability to hold them to maturity.
Financial assets categorised as held-to-maturity investments are subsequently measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.
(c) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables category com prises debt instruments and financial assets with fixed or determinable paymentsthat are not quoted in an active market,
Financial assets categorised as loans and receivables are subsequently measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method.

Available-forsale category comprises investment in equity and debt securities instruments that are not held fortrading,
Investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market and whose fair valuecannot be reliably measured are measured at cost. Other financial assets categorised as availabIe—forsale aresubsequently measured at their fair values with the gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income, exceptfor impairment losses, foreign exchange gains and losses arising from monetary items and gains and losses ofhedged items attributable to hedge risks of fair value hedges which are recognised in profit or loss. On derecognition,the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassified from equity into profit or loss.Interest calculated for a debt instrument using the effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss,
All financial assets. except forthose measured at fair value through profit or loss. are subject to review for impairment (seeNote 2(m)(i)).
Financial liabilities
All financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost other than those categorised as fair value throughprofit or loss, put options granted to non-controlling interests and compulsory convertible preference shares (refer below)
Fair value through profit or loss category comprises financial liabilities that are derivatives (except for a derivative that is afinancial guarantee contract or a designated and effective hedging instrument), contingent consideration payable in abusiness combination or ﬁnancial liabilities that are specifically designated into this category upon initial recognition.
Derivatives that are linked to and must be settled by delivery of equity instruments that do not have a quoted price in anactive market for identical instruments whose fair values otherwise cannot be reliably measured are measured at cost.
Financial liabilities categorised as fair value through profit or loss are subsequently measured at their fair values with thegain or loss recognised in profit or loss.
Put options granted to non—controlling interests
The Group granted put options to the non-controlling interests in existing subsidiaries over their equity interests in thosesubsidiaries which provide for settlement in cash by the Group. The Group recognises a liability for the present value of theexercise price of the options. Subsequent to initial recognition, the Group recognises the changes in the carrying amountof the financial liabilities in equity.
Compulsory convertible preference shares (“CCPS”)
CCPS are issued by a subsidiary. denominated in Indian Rupees and will be converted to share capital of the subsidiary atthe option of the holder. Where the number of shares to be issued is not fixed, the CCPS is classified as a liability andinitially recognised at its fair value and subsequent changes in fair value are recognised in profit or loss. Where the numberof shares to be issued becomes fixed, the related CCPS tranche is reclassified to equity at its fair value on that date
Financial guarantee contracts
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make speciﬁed payments to reimburse the holder fora loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with the original or modifiedterms of a debt instrument.
Fair value arising from ﬁnancial guarantee contracts are classified as deferred income and are amortised to profit or lossusing a straight-line method over the contractual period or, when there is no specified contractual period, recognised inprofit or loss upon discharge of the guarantee. When settlement of a financial guarantee contract becomes probable, anestimate of the obligation is made, If the carrying value of the financial guarantee contract is lower than the obligation. thecarrying value is adjusted to the obligation amount and accounted for as a provision.

Regular way purchase or sale of ﬁnancial assets
A regular way purchase or sale is a purchase or sale of a financial asset under a contract whose terms require delivery ofthe asset within the time frame established generally by regulation or convention in the marketplace concerned.
A regular way purchase or sale of financial assets is recognised and derecognised. as applicable. using trade dateaccounting. Trade date accounting refers to:
(a) the recognition ofan asset to be received and the liability to pay for it on the trade date, and
(b) derecognition of an asset that is sold, recognition of any gain or loss on disposal and the recognition of a receivablefrom the buyer for payment on the trade date.
Hedge accounting
Cash flow hedge
A cash flow hedge is a hedge of the exposure to variability in cash flows that is attributable to a particular risk associatedwith a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction and could affect the profit or loss In a cash flowhedge, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an effective hedge is recognisedin other comprehensive income and the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsequently, the cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassiﬁed from equity into profitor loss in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast cash flows affect profit or loss If the hedged itemis a nonefinancial asset or liability, the associated gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income is removed fromequity and included in the initial amount of the asset or liability, However, loss recognised in other comprehensive incomethat will not be recovered in one or more future periods is reclassified from equity into profit or loss.
Cash flow hedge accounting is discontinued prospectively when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated orexercised, the hedge is no longer highly effective, the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur or the hedgedesignation is revoked. If the hedge is for a forecast transaction, the cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrumentremains in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. When the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, anyrelated cumulative gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive income on the hedging instrument is reclassiﬁed fromequity into profit or loss.
Hedge of a net investment
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of a net investmentin a foreign operation are recognised in other comprehensive income to the extent that the hedge is effective, and arepresented within equity in the foreign currency translation reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, suchdifferences are recognised in profit or loss When the hedged part of a net investment is disposed of. the relevant amountin the foreign currency translation reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the gain or loss on disposal,
Derecognition
A financial asset or part of it is derecognised when, and only when the contractual rights to the cash ﬂows from the financialasset expire or control of the asset is not retained or substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership of the ﬁnancialasset are transferred to another party, On derecognition of a financial asset, the difference between the carrying amountand the sum of the consideration received (including any new asset obtained less any new liability assumed) and anycumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in equity is recognised in profit or loss.
A financial liability or a part of it is derecognised when, and only when, the obligation specified in the contract is dischargedor cancelled or expires. On derecognition of a financial liability, the difference between the carrying amount of the ﬁnancialliability extinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any non-cash assets transferredor liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss.

Property, plant and equipment
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
Recognition and measurement
Items of property. plant and equipment are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairmentlosses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset and any other cost directly attributableto bringing the asset to working condition for its intended use, and the cost of dismantling and removing the items andrestoring the site on which they are located, The cost of self—constructed assets also includes the cost of materials anddirect labour. For qualifying assets, borrowing cost is capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy on borrowingcosts, Cost also may include transfers from equity of any gain or loss on qualifying cash flow hedges of foreign currencypurchases of property, plant and equipments
Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised as part of that equipment.
The cost of property, plant and equipment recognised as a result of a business combination is based on fair value atacquisition date. The fair value of property is the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged betweenknowledgeable. willing parties in an arm‘s length transaction after proper marketing wherein the parties had each actedknowledgeably, prudently and without compulsion The fair value of other items of plant and equipment is based on thequoted market prices for similar items when available and replacement costs when appropriate.
When signiﬁcant parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for asseparate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Property that is being constructed for future use as investment property is accounted for as property, plant and equipment untilconstruction or development is complete, at which time it is reclassiﬁed as investment property and measured at fairvalue.
The gain or loss on disposal of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined by comparing the proceeds fromdisposal with the carrying amount of property, plant and equipment and is recognised net within “other operating incomeor “other operating expenses respectively in profit or loss.
Subsequent costs
The cost of replacing a component of an item of property, plant and equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of theitem if it is probable that the future economic benefits embodied within the component will flow to the Group. and its costcan be measured reliablyi The carwing amount of the replaced component is derecognised to proﬁt or loss. The costs ofthe dayetoeday servicing of property, plant and equipment are recognised in the profit or loss as incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is based on the cost of an asset less its residual value. Significant components of individual assets areassessed, and if a component has a useful life that is different from the remainder of that asset, then that component isdepreciated separately.
Depreciation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-Iine basis overthe estimated useful lives of each component of anitem of property, plant and equipment. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and their usefullives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end ofthe lease term Freehold land is notdepreciated. Property, plant and equipment under construction (constructioneineprogress) are not depreciated until theassets are ready fortheir intended use.

Finance lease
Leases in terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as financeleases. Upon initial recognition, the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and thepresent value of the minimum lease payments Subsequent to initial recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordancewith the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Minimum lease payments made under finance leases are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction ofthe outstanding liability. The ﬁnance expense is allocated to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constantperiodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Contingent lease payments are accounted for by revisingthe minimum lease payments over the remaining term of the lease when the lease adjustment is confirmed
Leasehold land which in substance is a finance lease is classiﬁed as property. plant and equipment. or as investmentproperty if held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both.
Operating lease
Leases, where the Group does not assume substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operatingleases and the leased assets are not recognised in the statement offinancial position.
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in proﬁt or loss on a straighteline basis over the term of the lease.Lease incentives received are recognised in profit or loss as an integral part of the total lease expense, over the term ofthe lease. Contingent rentals are charged to profit or loss in the reporting period in which they are incurred.
Prepayment for leasehold land which in substance is an operating lease is classified as prepaid lease payments, and areamortised over the term of the lease.
Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease
At inception of an arrangement, the Group determines whether such an arrangement is or contains a lease. This will be thecase ifthe following two criteria are met:
- the fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets; and- the arrangement contains a right to use the asset(s).
At inception or upon reassessment of the arrangement, the Group separates payments and other considerations requiredby such an arrangement into those for the lease and those for other elements on the basis of their relative fair values. If theGroup concludes for a finance lease that it is impracticable to separate the payments reliably, then an asset and a liability arerecognised at an amount equal to the fair value of the underlying asset. Subsequently, the liability is reduced as paymentsare made and an imputed finance charge on the liability is recognised using the Group's incremental borrowing rate.

Goodwill on consolidation
Goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. In respect of equity-accounted associates and jointventures, the carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment and an impairment loss on suchan investment is not allocated to any asset, including goodwill. that forms part of the carrying amount of the equity-accountedassociates and joint ventures
Intangible assets
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge andunderstanding, is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Development activities involve a plan ordesign forthe production of new or substantially improved products and processes.Development expenditure is capitalised only if development costs can be measured reliably, the product or process istechnically and commercially feasible, future economic benefits are probable and the Group intends to and has sufficientresources to complete development and to use or sell the asset.
The expenditure capitalised includes the cost of materials, direct labour and overheads costs that are directly attributableto prepare the asset for its intended use. For qualifying assets, borrowing costs are capitalised in accordance with theaccounting policy on borrowing costs. Other development expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Capitalised development expenditure is measured at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairmentlosses
(ii) Other intangible assets
Customer relationships thatare acquired bythe Group, which have finite useful lives, are measured at costless accumulatedamortisation and accumulated impairment losses
Brand names and hospital licenses that have indefinite lives and other intangible assets that are not yet available for useare stated at cost less impairment losses.
(iii) Subsequent expenditure
Subsequent expenditure is capitalised only when it increases the future economic benefits embodied in the specific assetto which it relates. All other expenditure is recognised in profit or loss as incurred.
(iv) AmortisationAmortisation is calculated based on the cost ofan asset less its residual valuet
Amortisation is recognised in proﬁt or loss on a straightAline basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets fromthe date that they are available for use
The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
Customer relationships 5 — 20 yearsCapitalised development costs 5 e 10 yearsBrand use rights remaining term of the rightFavourable lease arrangements remaining term of the leaseOther intangibles 3 — 10 years
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted, ifappropriate

Significant accounting policies (continued)Investment properties
(i) Recognition and measurement
Investment properties are properties which are held to earn rental income or for capital appreciation or for both, but not forsale in the ordinary course of business, use in the production or supply of goods or services or for administrative purposes.
Investment properties are measured initially at cost and subsequently at fair value with any change therein recognised inprofit or loss for the period in which they arise.
The fair value is determined based on internal valuation or independent professional valuation, Independent professionalvaluation is obtained annually for material investment properties.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the investment property‘ The cost of self—constructed investment property includes the cost of materials and direct labour, any other costs directly attributable tobringing the investment property to a working condition for their intended use and capitalised borrowing costs.
An investment property is derecognised on its disposal, or when it is permanently withdrawn from use and no futureeconomic benefits are expected from its disposal. The difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carryingamount ofthe investment property is recognised in profit or loss in the period in which the item is derecognisedt
(ii) Reclassiﬁcation to/from investment propertyWhen an item of property, plant and equipment is transferred to investment property following a change in its use, anydifference arising at the date of transfer between the carrying amount of the item immediately prior to transfer and its fairvalue is recognised directly in equity as a revaluation of property, plant and equipment However, if a fair value gainreverses a previous impairment loss, the gain is recognised in profit or loss. Upon disposal of an investment property, anysurplus previously recorded in equity is transferred to retained earnings; the transfer is not made through profit or loss.
When the use of a property changes such that it is reclassiﬁed as property, plant and equipment or inventories, its fair valueat the date of reclassiﬁcation becomes its cost for subsequent accounting
Development property
The cost of property under development comprises specifically identiﬁed costs, including acquisition costs, developmentexpenditure, borrowing costs and other related expenditure that can be allocated on a reasonable basis to the property underdevelopment Borrowing costs payable on loans funding a development property are also capitalised, on a speciﬁc identificationbasis, as part of the cost of the development property until the completion of development.
Development property is stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value represents the estimatedselling price less cost to be incurred in selling the property.
InventoriesInventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value,
Cost is calculated using the weighted average cost formula and comprises all costs of purchase and other costs incurred inbringing the inventories to their present location and conditions Due allowance is made for all damaged. expired and slowmoving items.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less the estimated costs necessary to makethe sale.
When inventories are sold, the carrying amount of those inventories is recognised as an expense in the period in which therelated revenue is recognised. The amount of any allowance for write-down of inventories to net realisable value and all lossesof inventories are recognised as an expense in the period the writeedown or loss occurs. The amount of any reversal of anyallowance for write-down of inventories, arising from an increase in net realisable value, is recognised as a reduction in theamount of inventories recognised as an expense in the period in which the reversal occurs.

Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents consist of cash on hand, balances and deposits with banks and highly liquid investments which havean insignificant risk of changes in fair value with original maturities of three months or less, and are used by the Group in themanagement of their short term commitments For the purpose of the statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents arepresented net of bank overdrafts and pledged deposits
Assets classified as held for sale
Assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale ordistribution to owners ratherthan through continuing use, are classified as held for sale or distribution.
Immediately before classiﬁcation as held for sale or distribution. the assets. or components of a disposal group. are remeasuredin accordance with the Group’s accounting policies Thereafter generally the assets, or disposal group, are measured at thelower of their carn/ing amount and fair value less cost of disposal.
Any impairment loss on a disposal group is first allocated to goodwill, and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro ratabasis, except that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax assets, and investment property, whichcontinue to be measured in accordance with the Group‘s accounting policies. Impairment losses on initial classification as heldfor sale or distribution and subsequent gains or losses on remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are notrecognised in excess of any cumulative impairment loss.
Intangible assets and property, plant and equipment once classified as held for sale or distribution are not amortised ordepreciated. in addition, equity accounting of associates and joint ventures ceases once classiﬁed as held for sale or distribution.
Impairment
(i) Financial assets
All financial assets (except forfinancial assets categorised as fair valuethrough profit or loss and investments in subsidiaries,associates and joint ventures) are assessed at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence of impairmentas a result of one or more events having an impact on the estimated future cash flows of the asset. Losses expected as aresult of future events, no matter how likely, are not recognised For an investment in an equity instrument, a significant orprolonged decline in the fair value below its cost is an objective evidence of impairment. If any such objective evidenceexists, then the impairment loss of the financial asset's recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss in respect of loans and receivables and heldetoematurity investments is recognised in profit or loss andis measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flowsdiscounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of anallowance account.
An impairment loss in respect of availabIe-for-sale financial instruments is recognised in profit or loss and is measured asthe difference between the asset's acquisition cost (net of any principal repayment and amortisation) and the asset'scurrent fairvalue, less any impairment loss previously recognised, Where a decline in the fairvalue of an available-for—salefinancial asset has been recognised in the other comprehensive income, the cumulative loss in other comprehensiveincome is reclassified from equity to profit or loss‘
An impairment loss in respect of unquoted equity instrument that is carried at cost is recognised in profit or loss and ismeasured as the difference between the financial asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset.
Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for an investment in an equity instrument classified as availableeforesale isnot reversed through profit or loss.
If, in a subsequent period, the fair value of a debt instrument increases and the increase can be objectively related to anevent occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss, the impairment loss is reversed, to the extentthatthe assets carrying amount does not exceed what the carrying amount would have been had the impairment not beenrecognised at the date the impairment is reversed. The amount of the reversal is recognised in profit or loss‘

Impairment (continued)
(ii)
Other assets
The carrying amounts of other assets (except for inventories, development properties and deferred tax assets) are reviewedat the end of each reporting period to determine whether there is any indication ofimpairment. If any such indication exists,then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated‘ For goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or thatare not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each period at the same time and whenever there is anindication that they may be impaired.
For the purpose ofimpairment testing, assets are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cashinflows from continuing use that are largely independent of the cash inflows of other assets or cashegenerating units.Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, cash-generating units towhich goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment testing is performed reflects thelowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Thegoodwill acquired in a business combination,for the purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to group of cash»generating units that are expected to beneﬁt from thesynergies of the combination,
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs tosell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a preetaxdiscount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset orcash»generating unit.
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount ofan asset or its related cash-generating unit exceeds its estimatedrecoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss, Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units areallocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the cash-generating unit (a group of cash-generating units) and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the cashegenerating unit (groups of cash,generating units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in priorperiods are assessed at the end of each reporting period for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longerexists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverableamount since the last impairment loss was recognised. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the assetscarwing amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net ofdepreciation or amortisation,if no impairment loss had been recognised. Reversals of impairment losses are credited to profit or loss in the financial yearin which the reversals are recognised,
Equity instruments
Instruments classified as equity are measured at cost on initial recognition and are not remeasured subsequently.

Distributions of non-cash assets to owners of the Company
The Group measures a liability to distribute non-cash assets as a dividend to the owners of the Company at the fair valueof the assets to be distributed The carrying amount of the dividend is remeasured at each reporting period and at thesettlement date, with any changes recognised directly in equity as adjustments to the amount of the distribution‘ Onsettlement of the transaction, the Group recognises the difference, if any, between the carrying amount of the assetsdistributed and the carrying amount of the liability in profit or loss.

Perpetual securities
The perpetual securities do not have a maturity date and the issuer is able to elect to defer making a distribution, subject to theterms and conditions of the securities issue. Accordingly, the perpetual securities are presented within equity as the issuer is notconsidered to have a contractual obligation to make principle repayments or distributions in respect of its perpetual securities,Distributions are treated as dividends which will be directly debited from retained earnings Incremental costs directly attributableto the issuance of perpetual securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.
Employee benefits
(i) Short-term employee beneﬁts
Short-term employee benefit obligations in respect of salaries, annual bonuses, paid annual leave and sick leave aremeasured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related sewice is provided.
A liability is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus if the Group has a present legalor constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation canbe estimated reliably.
The Group's contributions to defined contribution plans are charged to the profit or loss in the year to which they relatePrepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in future payment isavailable.
(ii) Defined benefits plansThe Group has nonefunded defined benefits plans given to employees of certain subsidiaries within the Group.
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefits retirement plan and termination plan are calculated by estimatingthe amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their services in the current and prior periods,discounting that amount and deducting the fair value of any plan assets
The calculation is performed annually by a qualiﬁed actuary using the projected unit credit method. When the calculationresults in a potential asset forthe Group. the recognised asset is limited to the present value of economic benefits availablein the form of any future refunds from the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan. To calculate the presentvalue of economic benefits, consideration is given to any applicable minimum funding requirements.
Remeasurements of the net defined benefit liability, which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the return on plan assets(excluding interest), if any, and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any, excluding interest), are recognised immediately in othercomprehensive income. The Group determines the net interest expense or income on the net defined liability or asset forthe period by applying the discount rate used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annualperiod to the then net defined benefit liability or asset, taking into account any changes in the net defined benefit liabilityor asset during the period as a result of contributions and beneﬁt payments
Net interest expense and other expenses relating to defined benefits plans are recognised in profit or loss‘
When the benefits of a plan are changed or when a plan is curtailed, the resulting change in benefit that relates to pastservice or the gain or loss on curtailment is recognised immediately in profit or loss. The Group recognises gains and losseson the settlement ofa defined benefit plan when the settlement occurs.
The gain or loss on settlement is the difference between the present value of the defined benefit obligation being settledas determined on the date of settlement and the settlement price, including any plan assets transferred and any paymentsmade directly by the Group in connection with the settlement.
(iii) Share—based payments transactions
The grant date fair value of share—based payments granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense. with acorresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees unconditionally become entitled to the awards. Theamount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and nonemarketvesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on thenumber of awards that meet the related service and nonemarket performance conditions at the vesting date.

Service and nonemarketperformance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken into account in determining fair value.
Provision
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can beestimated reliably, and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions aredetermined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the timevalue of money and the risks specific to the liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as finance cost

Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer, recoveryof the consideration is probable, the associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably, there is nocontinuing management involvement with the goods, and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably.
Rental income
Rental income receivable under operating lease is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the term of thelease. Lease incentives granted are recognised as an integral part of the total rental income over the term of the leaseContingent rentals are recognised as income in the reporting period in which they are earned.
Dividend incomeDividend income from investments is recognised in proﬁt or loss on the date that the right to receive payment is established.
Sale of development property
The Group recognises income on property development projects when the signiﬁcant risks and rewards of ownership havebeen transferred to the purchasers Revenue and associated expenses will be recognised upon the transfer of significantrisks and rewards of ownership, which generally coincides with the time the development units are delivered to thepurchasers i.e. upon the completion of the construction and when the rest of the purchase price is paid.
Revenue excludes goods and services or other sale taxes and is after deduction of any trade discounts N0 revenue isrecognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding recovery of the consideration due, associated costs or thepossible return of unit sold.

Fina nce costs
Finance costs comprises interest expense on borrowings, finance lease liabilities and bonds, amortisation of borrowingtransaction costs and discount on bonds, bank Charges, net fair value losses on ﬁnancial derivatives that are recognised in profitor loss, net fair value losses of CCPS liabilities, and net exchange losses from foreign currency denominated interest-bearingborrowings and lendings.
Borrowing costs thatare not directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production ofa qualifying asset are recognisedin profit or loss using the effective interest method.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition. construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets thatnecessarilytake a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are capitalised as part of the cost ofthoseassets.
The capitalisation of borrowing costs as part of the cost of a qualifying asset commences when expenditure for the asset is beingincurred, borrowing costs are being incurred and activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for its intended use or saleare in progress Capitalisation of borrowing costs is suspended or ceases when substantially all the activities necessary toprepare the qualifying asset for its intended use or sale are interrupted or completed.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets isdeducted from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except tothe extent that it relates to a business combination or items recognised directly in equity or other comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year. using tax rates enacted orsubstantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous ﬁnancial years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities in the statement of financial position and their tax bases Deferred tax is not recognised for the followingtemporary differences: the initial recognition of goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities in a transaction that is not abusiness combination and that affects neither accounting nor taxable proﬁt or loss, Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates thatare expected to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, based on the laws that have been enacted orsubstantively enacted by the end of the reporting period.
Where investment properties are carried at their fair value in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 2(h), theamount ofdeferred tax recognised is measured using the tax rates that would apply on sale ofthose assets at their carrying valueat the reporting date unless the property is depreciable and is held with the objective to consume substantially all of the economicbenefits embodied in the property over time rather than through sale. In other cases, the amount of deferred tax recognised ismeasured based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities, usingtax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the reporting date. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and assets, andthey relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax entities, but they intendto settle current tax liabilities and assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will be realised simultaneously.
A deferred tax asset is recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which thetemporary difference can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and are reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised.
A tax incentive that is not a tax base of an asset is recognised as a reduction of tax expense in profit or loss as and when it isgranted and claimed, Any unutilised portion of the tax incentive is recognised as a deferred tax asset to the extent that it isprobable that future taxable profits will be available against which the unutilised tax incentive can be utilised.

Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Companyby the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year, adjusted for own shares held.
Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted average numberof ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, whichcomprise share options granted to employees
Both basic and diluted EPS of the Group are adjusted to take into consideration the effect of perpetual securities distribution onearnings.
Operating segments
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues andincur expenses, including revenues and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. Anoperating segment’s operating results are reviewed regularly by the chief operating decision maker, which in this case is theBoard of Directors of the Company, to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess itsperformance, and for which discrete financial information is available.
Contingencies
(i) Contingent liabilities
Where it is not probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably,the obligation is not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent liability, unless theprobability of outflow of economic benefits is remote, Possible obligations. whose existence will only be conﬁrmed by theoccurrence or non-occurrence ofone or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent liabilities unless the probabilityof outflow of economic benefits is remote.
(ii) Contingent assets
Where it is not probable that there is an inﬂow of economic benefits, or the amount cannot be estimated reliably, the assetis not recognised in the statements of financial position and is disclosed as a contingent asset, unless the probability ofinflow of economic benefits is remote, Possible obligations, whose existence will only be confirmed by the occurrence ornon-occurrence of one or more future events, are also disclosed as contingent assets unless the probability of inflow ofeconomic benefits is remote.
Fair value measurements
Fairvalue of an asset or a liability, except for share-based payment and lease transactions, is determined as the price that wouldbe received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at the measurementdate. The measurement assumes that the transaction to sell the asset or transfer the liability takes place either in the principalmarket or in the absence of a principal market, in the most advantageous market.
For non-financial asset. the fair value measurement takes into account a market participant’s ability to generate economicbenefits by using the asset in its highest and best use or by selling it to another market participant that would use the asset in itshighest and best use.
When measuring the fair value of an asset or a liability, the Group uses observable market data as far as possible. Fairvalue arecategorised into different levels in a fair value hierarchy based on the input used in the valuation technique as follows:
Level1: Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at themeasurement date.
Level 2: Inputs otherthan quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly orindirectly.
Level 3: Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
The Group recognises transfers between levels of the fair value hierarchy as of the date of the event or change in circumstancesthat caused the transfers

Determination of fair value
Investment properties are stated at fair value based on independent professional valuations, The fair values are based on openmarket values, being the estimated amount for which a property could be exchanged on the date of valuation between a willingbuyer and a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction wherein the parties had each acted knowledgeably and withoutcompulsion
In determining the fairvalue, the valuers have used valuation techniques which involve certain estimates, The key assumptionsused to determine the fair value of investment properties include market corroborated capitalised yield, terminal yield, discountrate and average growth rate.
The valuers have considered valuation techniques including the direct comparison method, the direct capitalisation approach,and the discounted cash flow approach in arriving at the open market value as at the balance sheet date. The direct comparisonmethod involves the analysis of comparable sales of similar properties and adjusting the sale prices to that reflective of theinvestment properties The direct capitalisation approach capitalises an income stream into a present value using revenuemultipliers or singleeyear capitalisation rates. The discounted cash flow approach involves the estimation and the projection ofan income stream over a period and discounting the income stream with an appropriate rate of return
Fair value hierarchyThe fair value of the investment properties are categorised as follows:

that caused the transfer.

Impairment testing for cash-generating units containing goodwill, brand names and hospital licences
(a)
(17}
Healthcare services and Education CGUs
Key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount
For the purpose of impairment testing, the carn/ing amounts are allocated to the Group’s operating divisions which are thecash-generating units (“CGU”). Recoverable amount of each CGU is estimated based on its value in use. The value in usecalculations apply a discounted cash flow model using cash flow projections based on past experience, actual operatingresults, approved financial budgets for 2018 and 5 to 10 years business plan.
The key assumptions for the computation of value in use of goodwill, brand names and hospital licences include thefollowing:
(i) Reven ue growth assumptions:
- Healthcare services CGUs: 4% to 25% (2016: 4% to 58%) per annum in the ﬁrst 3 years with 2% to 39% (2016: 2%to 25%) revenue growth for the subsequent years; and
- Education CGU: »4% to 1% (2016: -7% to 0%) per annum for the first 3 years with 0% to 1% (2016: 9% to 0%)revenue growth for subsequent yearsl
(ii) EBITDA margins assumptions:
- Healthcare services CGUs: 7% to 29% (2016: 7% to 31%); and- Education CGU: 28% to 32% (2016: 30% to 33%)
The projections are in line with the proposed expansion plans for the respective investees.(iii) Terminal value was estimated using the perpetuity growth model:
- Healthcare services CGUs: 2% to 4% (2016: 2% to 4%) per annum; and- Education CGU: 0% (2016: 0%) per annum
The terminal values were applied to steadyestate estimated earnings at the end of the projected period.
(iv) Discount rates of approximately 7.5% to 15.5% (2016: 70% to 16.0%) which were based on the cost of capital plus anappropriate risk premium at the date of assessment of the respective CGUs.
(v) There will be no other significant changes in the government policies and regulations which will directly affect theinvestees‘ businesses. The inflation for the operating expenses is in line with the estimated gross domestic productgrowth rate for the countw based on the past trends.
The values assigned to the key assumptions represent the Group’s assessment of future trends in the healthcare andeducation market and are based on both external sources and internal sources (historical data)
The Group believes that no reasonably foreseeable changes in the above key assumptions that would cause the carryingvalues of these CGUs to materially exceed their recoverable amounts other than changes in the prevailing operatingenvironment of which the impact is not ascertainable.
PLife REIT CGU
Recoverable amount of PLife REIT is based on fair value less cost to sell, using the open market price of this CGU as atreporting date.

Changes in interest in subsidiaries
(i) In 2015, the Company invested in a non—direct wholly owned subsidiary, Pantai Medical Centre Sdn, Bhd. (“PMC), througha subscription of 260,000,000 redeemable preference shares for a total cash consideration of RM260,000,000.
In January 2017, PMC redeemed the 260,000.000 redeemable preference shares held by the Company for a total cashconsideration of RM260,000,000t
(ii) During the year, pursuant to its capital reduction process. a wholly owned subsidiary, Integrated Healthcare Holdings(Bharat) Limited, returned its capital of USD160,080,000 t0 the Company by buying back and cancelled 160,079,950 of itsown shares for a total consideration of USD160,080,000 (RM692,302,000). This transaction resulted in a reduction ofRM489,937,000 in the Company‘s cost of investment in subsidiaries and a realised foreign exchange gain on return ofcapital of RM202,365,000 which is recognised in the Company’s profit or loss
(iii) During the year, pursuant to its liquidation process, a wholly owned subsidiary, Integrated Healthcare Capital Sdn. Bhd,(“IHCSB”) returned its capital of RM598,000 to the Company, resulted in a reduction of RM598,000 in the Company’s costof investment in subsidiaries In December 2017, IHCSB was liquidated The Company wrote off the remaining RM928,000cost of investment in IHCSB against the provision made in prior years
Details of the investment in subsidiaries are as disclosed in Note 46.
Although the Group owns less than half of the ownership interest in, and less than half of the voting power of PLife REIT, theGroup has determined that it controls PLife REIT. The Group has de facto control over PLife REIT, on the basis that the remainingvoting rights in PLife REIT are widely dispersed and that there is no indication that all other shareholders exercise their votescollectively.
The Group via PLife REIT, does not hold any ownership interest in the special purpose entities (SPES) listed in Note 46, TheSPEs were established under terms that impose strict limitations on the decisionemaking powers of the SPEs' management,resulting in the Group receiving the majority of the benefits related to the SPES’ operations and net assets, being exposed to themajority of risks incident to the SPEs' activities, and retaining the majority of the residual or ownership risks related to the SPEsor their assets. Consequently, the SPEs are regarded as subsidiaries of the Group.

Offsetting ﬁnancial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
The Group's derivative transactions are entered into under International Swaps and Derivatives Association (“ISDA”) masternetting agreements In general, under such agreements, the amounts owed by each counterparty in respect of the sametransactions outstanding in the same currency under the agreement are aggregated into a single net amount that is payable byone party to the other, In certain circumstances, for example when a credit event such as a default occurs, all outstandingtransactions under the agreement are terminated, the termination value is assessed and only a single net amount is due orpayable in settlement ofall outstanding transactions.
The above agreements do not meet the criteria for offsetting in the statement of financial position as the right to set-off recognisedamounts is enforceable only following an event of default, insolvency or bankruptcy of the Group or the counterparties. Inaddition, the Group and its counterparties do not intend to settle on a net basis or to realise the assets and settle the liabilitiessimultaneously in its normal course of business.

Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk

Exposure to credit risk, credit quality and collateral
As at the end of the financial year, the maximum exposure to credit risk arising from receivables and ﬁnancial assets isrepresented by the carrying amounts in the statements of financial position.
The Group establishes an allowance for impairment that represents its estimate of incurred losses in respect of tradereceivables. The main components of this allowance are a specific loss component that relates to individually significantexposures, and a collective loss component established for groups of similar assets in respect of losses that have beenincurred but not yet identified. The collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statisticsfor similar financial assets. Specific impairment allowance is provided on a case—by-case basis depending on thecircumstances while collective loss allowance is determined based on historical data of payment statistics for similarfinancial assets.
The allowance account in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is satisfiedthat no recovery of the amount owing is possible. At that point, the financial asset is considered irrecoverable and theamount Charged to the allowance account is written off against the carwing amount of the impaired ﬁnancial asset,
At the end of the financial year, the Group has outstanding trade receivables from 2 significant customers amounting toRM201,467,000 (2016: one significant customer with a trade receivable balance of RM77,461,000), which is individually 5%or more of the Group‘s gross trade receivables.

Market risk
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices. such as foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices willaffect the Group’s ﬁnancial position or cash flows.
(3)
Foreign currency risk
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument will fluctuate becauseof changes in foreign exchange rates
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on sales, purchases, cash and cash equivalents, receivables andpayables, and loans and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the respective functionalcurrencies of Group entities. The currencies giving rise to this risk are primarily the Singapore Dollar, United StatesDollar, Euro, Japanese Yen, Chinese Renminbi, Hong Kong Dollar and India Rupee.
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group uses foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign currency movements on itsnet income denominated in Japanese Yen from its investment in Japan, Where necessary, the foreign exchangefonNard contracts are rolled over at maturity.
The Group actively monitors its foreign currency risk and minimises such risk by borrowing in the functional currencyof the borrowing entity or by borrowing in the same currency as the foreign investment (i.e. natural hedge of netinvestments).
The Group also enters in cross currency interest rate swaps to realign borrowings to the same currency of theGroup’s foreign investments to achieve a natural hedge (See Note 37(vi)).
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities held in currencies other than the functional currencies, the Groupensures that the net exposure is kept to an acceptable level by buying or selling foreign currencies at spot rate wherenecessary to address short term imbalances.
See Note 26 for the nominal value and fair value of the foreign exchange forward contracts and cross currencyinterest rate swaps,

A 10% strengthening of the following currencies against the respective functional currencies of the Group entities atthe end of the financial year would have increased/(decreased) profit or loss before tax by the amounts shown below.This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remained constant and ignores any impactof forecasted sales and purchases.

The foreign currency risk associated with the Japanese denominated outstanding forward foreign exchange contractsas at 31 December 2017 would have no significant impact to the Group as the Group would have a correspondinggain in its net future income from Japan as a result of the weakening of Malaysian Ringgit.
A 10% weakening of the above currencies against the respective functional currencies of the Group entities at theend of the financial year would have an equal but opposite effect on the above currencies to the amounts shownabove, on the basis that all other variables remained constant.
Interest rate risk
This relates to changes in interest rates which affect mainly the Group's fixed deposits and its debt obligations withbanks and financial institutions. The Group’s fixed7rate financial assets and borrowings are exposed to a risk ofchange in their fair value while the variable~rate financial assets and borrowings are exposed to a risk of change incash flows. Short term receivables and payables are not significantly exposed to interest rate risk.
The Group has no significant concentration of interest rate risk that may arise from exposure to Group's ﬁxed depositsand its obligations with banks and financial institutions,
Risk management objectives, policies and processes for managing the risk
The Group’s policy is to manage its interest cost using a mix of ﬁxed and variable rate debts as well as by rolling overits ﬁxed deposits and variable rate borrowings on a short-term basis. In respect of Iong-term borrowings, the Groupmay enter into interest rate derivatives to manage its exposure to adverse movements in interest rates
Interest rate swaps have been entered into to achieve an appropriate mix of fixed and floating rate exposures withinthe Group‘s policy (See Note 36(vi)).
See Note 26 for the nominal value and fair value of the interest rate swaps.
