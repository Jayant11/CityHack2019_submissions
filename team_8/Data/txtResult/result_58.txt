FINANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Treasury shares and contracts on treasury sharesShares ofJulius Baer Group Ltd. held by theGroup are classified in equity as treasury sharesand accounted for at weighted average cost.
The difference between the proceeds From sales
of treasury shares and their cost (net of taxes, ifany) is recognised in retained earnings.
Contracts on shares of Julius Baer Group Ltd. thatrequire settlement in a fixed number ofshares for
a fixed amount are recognised in treasury shares.Upon settlement of such contracts, the proceedsreceived (net of costs and any taxes) are recognisedin retained earnings.
Contracts on shares of Julius Baer Group Ltdthat must be settled net in cash or that offer achoice of settlement methods are treated asderivative instruments, with changes in fair valuerecognised in net trading income.
For physically settled written put option contractsthe discounted strike price is deducted from equityand recorded as a liability at initial recognition.The liability is subsequently increased during theterm of the contract up to the strike price usingthe effective interest method. Upon settlement ofthe contract the liability is derecognised.
Earnings per share (EPS)Basic consolidated earnings per share is calculatedby dividing the net profit for the reporting period
attributable to shareholders ofJulius Baer Group Ltd.
by the weighted average number of sharesoutstanding during the reporting period.
Diluted consolidated earnings per share is calculatedusing the same method as for basic consolidatedearnings per share, with the determinants adjustedto reﬂect the potential dilution that could occur ifoutstanding options, warrants, convertible debtsecurities or other contracts to issue shares wereconverted or exercised into shares.
Segment reporting
Determination of the operating segments is basedon the management approach. The managementapproach reﬂects the way in which managementorganises the entity for making operating decisionsand for assessing performance, based on discrete
99
financial information. Therefore, the adoption of themanagement approach results in the disclosure ofinformation for segments in substantially the samemanner as they are reported internally and usedby the entity’s chieic operating decision maker forpurposes of evaluating performance and makingresource allocation decisions.
Contingent liabilities and irrevocablecommitments
Contingent liabilities and irrevocable commitmentsare not recognised in the balance sheet. However,
if an outflow of resources becomes probable andis a present obligation From a past event that
can be reliably measured, a respective liability isrecognised
CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In 2017, there were no new standards or amendmentsto existing standards that had a material impact onthe Group’s financial statements.
[\EW STANDARDS AND INTER—PRETA|ONS NOT YET ADOPTED

Certain new standards, revisions and interpretations0 existing standards were published that must
be applied in Future Financial periods. The GroupP
0
ans not to adopt these in advance. A number
these changes may have an impact on theGroup’s consolidated financial statements, asoutlined below.
T
in
1e Following standards, revisions andterpretations will be relevant to the Group:
IFRS 9 — Financial InstrumentsTwe new standard includes the followingchanges to current accounting for financial

instruments:
Recognition and measurement: The new standarduses two criteria to determine how ﬁnancial assetsshould be classified and therefore measured: a) theentity's business model for managing the financialassets; and b) the contractual cash flow characteristicsof the financial asset.
===================================================
101.hocr: 
FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
A business model refers to how an entity managesits financial assets in order to generate cash flows:
by collecting contractual cash flows, i.e. cashflows stem primarily from interest payments
and repayment of the principal;
by selling the financial assets, Le. cash Flows stemprimarily from buying and selling the financialasset; or
by a combination ofthe two models above.
The additional criteria for determining the classifi-cation of a financial asset is whether the contractualcash Flows are solely payments of principal andinterest. Interest under this model can comprise areturn not only for the time value of money andcredit risk but also for other components such asreturn for liquidity risk, amounts to cover expensesand a profit margin.
ysis of the business model and thenature of the contractual cash flows, a financial assetis measured at amortisecl cost, fair value throughprofit or loss, or fair value through other comprehenesiveincome(wit1 and without recycling).
Based on an ana
Expected credit losses: Contrary to the currentimpairment moc el for debt instruments, the
new standard requires an entity to recogniseexpected credit osses at initial recognition of thedebt instrument and to update the amount ofexpected credit osses recognised at each reportingdate to reflect changes in the credit risk of debt
instruments. It is therefore no longer necessary for a

trigger event to ave occurred before credit losses
are recognised.
In general, the expected credit loss model uses adual measurement approach: it the credit risk ofa debt instrument has not increased significantlysince its initial recognition, the debt instrumentwill attract a loss allowance equal to lZamonthexpected credit losses (‘stage 1’ ECL). If its creditrisk has increased signiﬁcantly, it will attract anallowance equal to lifetime expected credit losses(‘stage 2’ ECL) or the debt instrument is credit-impaired (‘stage 3’ ECL).
100
Financial liabilities: Financial liabilities are measuredat amortised cost or fair value. The new standardretains the fair value option for financial liabilities,but requires that the amount of change in fairvalue attributable to changes in the credit risk ofthe liability (own credit risk) be presented in othercomprehensive income (OCI) without reclassificationto the income statement. The remaining amount oftotal gain or loss is included in the income statement.If this approach creates or enlarges an accountingmismatch, the whole change in fair value may berecognised in the income statement.
Hedge accounting: The new standard puts in place
a model that introduces significant improvementsprincipally by aligning the accounting for hedges moreclosely with the underlying risk management purposes.To that effect, the effectiveness test has been over-hauled and replaced with the principle ofan ‘economicrelationship’. Hedge qualification will be based onqualitative, forwardelooking hedge effectivenessassessments, rather than on bright lines. There
are also enhanced disclosure requirements abouthedge accounting and risk management activities.
The new standard will be effectivel January 2018.
During the second haltc of2017, the Group finalisedits assessment of the impact of IFRS 9 on theGroup's Financial statements. The following appliesas oil January 2018:
Recognition and measurement: Based on the analysesof the two classification criteria ‘contractual cashflow characteristics’ and ‘business model’, the Groupdetermined that the debt instruments currentlyreported at amortisecl cost generally fulfil the criteriaand therefore will be measured at amortised cost onan ongoing basis. The same applies to the debtinstruments currently reported as availableeforesaleand therefore measured at fair value through OCI,which will also be measured at fair value throughOCI under the new standard.
A small number of equity instruments currentlymeasured at fair value through OCl will be classiﬁedas at fair value through profit or loss going forward.The related fair value gains and losses currentlyrecognised in OCl will be reclassified to retainedearnings as ofl January 2018.

FINANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
In summary, there are no significant changes to themeasurement basis arising from adopting the newclassiﬁcation and measurement model.
Expected credit losses: The Group has modelled itsimpairment loss estimation methodology to quantifythe impact ofthe expected credit losses on itsfinancial statements. The four models (for theLombard loans business, mortgages business, duefrom banks business and treasury business,respectively) are generally based on the specificfinancial instruments probability of default (PD),
its loss given default (LGD) and the exposure atdefault (EAD), taking into account the respectiveeffective interest rates. These models are tailored
to the Group’s fully collateralised Lombard loansand mortgages, and the high-quality debt securitiesin the treasury portfolio. The models have beenthoroughly tested based on the existing data. As of31 December 2017, the following allowances Jforcredit losses would have been recognised in thefinancial statements due to the new expected creditloss model under IFRS 9:
— Lombard loans: CHF 6.7 million;— Mortgages: CHF 5.0 million; and— Due from banks: CHF 0.2 million.
The total allowance for expected credit losses
on Lombard loans, mortgages and amounts
due from banks to be recognised under IFRS 9(‘stage 1’ and 1stage 2' ECL) is comparable tothe currently recognised collective allowance forcredit losses on these positions (see Note 9C).The difference of CHF 4.4 million between thecurrently recognised collective allowance for creditlosses(CHF16.3 million) and the new expectedcredit losses under IFRS 9 (CHF 11.9 million) willbe recognised in equity (retained earnings) attransition date.
The Group did not change its approach for thecalculation of speciﬁc allowances for credit losses.Therefore, the currently recognised speciﬁcallowance for credit losses in the amount of
CHF 24.2 million for Lombard loans and mortgagesequals the new allowance for credit-impairedfinancial assets under IFRS 9 (‘stage 3' ECL).
101
Under the current accounting standard, the Groupdoes not recognise any allowance for its treasuryportfolio in 2017, Therefore, the new allowance forcredit losses in the amount of CHF 1.7 million tobe recorded under IFRS 9 (‘stage 1’ and ‘stage 2’)will be recognised in equity (retained earnings) attransition date.
Financial liabilities: The Group will continue to applyits current measurement approach, including the useof the fair value option. No material changes arise.
Hedge accounting: The Group has analysed itsexisting micro hedges that are designated in etfectivehedging relationships and has determined that themicro hedge relationships would also qualify for hedgeaccounting under IFRS 9‘ The Group continues toapply IAS 39 (except for the new disclosures
under IFRS 9) until the |ASB issues a Final hedgeaccounting standard including micro and macrohedging.
Transition: The Group will not restate prior periods inits 2018 financial statements.
IFRS 15 — Revenue Recognition
The new standard, including the clarificationspublished in 2016, introduces the core principle
to recognise revenue to depict the transfer ofservices to customers in amounts that reflect theconsideration (that is, payment) to which the Groupexpects to be entitled in exchange for those services.
The standard contains a single model that appliesto contracts with customers and two approaches
to recognise revenue: at a point of time or over time.The model features a contractibased tiveistepanalysis of transactions to determine whether, howmuch and when revenue is recognised:
identity the contract(s) with a customer (step 1);identity the performance obligations in thecontract (step 2);
determine the transaction price (step 3);allocate the transaction price to theperformance obligations in the contract (step 4);recognise revenue when (or as) the Groupsatisfies a performance obligation (step 5).
===================================================
103.hocr: 
FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The new standard also provides guidance fortransactions that were not previously addressedcomprehensively and improves guidance formultipleeelement arrangements. In addition,enhanced disclosures about revenue are required.
The new standard will be effective1January 2018with earlier application permitted. However, theGroup did not early apply IFRS 15. The impact ofthe new standard on the Group's financial statementsis not material and is mainly related to disclosures.
IFRS 16 — Leases
The new standard introduces a single lesseeaccounting model and requires a lessee to recogniseassets and liabilities For all leases with a term ofmore than 12 months, unless the underlying assetis of low value. A lessee is required to recognise
a righteofeuse asset representing its right to usethe underlying leased asset and a lease liabilityrepresenting its obligation to make lease payments.A lessee measures righteofeuse assets similarly toother nonefinancial assets and lease liabilities
102
similarly to other financial liabilities. As a consequence,a lessee recognises depreciation of the righteofeuseasset and interest on the lease liability.
The new standard will be effective1January 2019with earlier application permitted. However, theGroup does not intend to early apply |FRS16.The impact of the new standard on the Group'sfinancial statements is currently assessed.
IFRIC 23 — Uncertainty over Income TaxTreatment
The new interpretation clarifies how to apply therecognition and measurement requirements in
IAS 12 Income Taxes when there is uncertainty overincome tax treatment. An entity concludes whetherit is probable that the taxation authority will acceptan uncertain tax treatment or not and shall reflectthe effect of uncertainty in its financial statements.
The new interpretation will be effective1January2019 with earlier application permitted. However,the Group does not intend to early apply IFRlC 23.The impact of the new interpretation has not yetbeen assessed,

COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
RISK MANAGEMENT FRAMEWORKAND PROCESS
Risk types
For the purposes of this report, risk comprises boththe probability of a given event occurring and itspotential adverse impact in the event of a deviationfrom Julius Baer Group's (the Group) definedobjectives. Risk taking is an inherent component ofthe Group's day-to—day business activities. Riskmanagement therefore constitutes an integral partof the Group’s business framework. lt is supportedby a number of risk control procedures, which areseen as business enablers critical to the managementprocess of the Group. The principal risks to whichthe Group is exposed are:
strategic and business risk
credit risk
market risk
liquidity and financing risk
operational risk (including legal, complianceand personnel risk)
reputational risk
The risk control framework comprises both qualitativeelements, including policies and directives, andquantitative components, including limits. It iscontinually adapted and enhanced, both in responseto changes in the business environment and to
any modifications to the business models pursuedby the Group.
Risk governance
The Board 01‘ Directors ofJulius Baer Group Ltd.defines the Group’s risl< policies and regularly reviewstheir appropriateness. This ensures that risks aremanaged effectively at Group level and that suitableprocesses are in place. The risk categories and therisk management processes as well as a commonrisk terminology for the Group are laid down in
the Group Risk Policy. Speciﬁc Group policies aredefined for particular risk categories. Overallresponsibility for the implementation ofthe Group’srisk management lies with those members of
the Executive Board of Julius Baer Group Ltd. with
designated risk management duties — the ChieicRisk Officer (CRO) and the General Counsel (GC).
103
The CRO is responsible for the management andcontrol of credit risk, market risk (trading book
and banking book), liquidity and ﬁnancing risl<(particularly with regard to the banking book) and
of operational risk Especially as far as legal andcompliance risk matters are concerned, he coordinateshis activities with the GC, who, as a member of
the Executive Board of Julius Baer Group Ltd., isresponsible for the management and control of legaland compliance risk at Group level. In addition, theCR0 and the GC coordinate their activities with theChief Financial Officer (CFO), who is responsiblefor balance—sheet, capital and liquidity management.The CFO's duties thus include maintaining a soundratio of eligible capital to risk—weightecl positions andensuring that sufficient liquidity is available at alltimes.
The CR0 and the GC establish appropriate riskguidelines and policies, coordinate and contributedirectly to the risk management of the businessareas and thus ensure that risk is controlled inde*pendently.
Additional Board committees and the ExecutiveBoard are integrated into the Group-wide riskmanagement structure as follows:
The Board of Directors delegates the supervisionof operational risks to the Audit Committee, whilethe supervision of all other risks is entrusted to theChairman’s & Risk Committee. The responsibilitiesof these two committees are described in furtherdetail in the Board of Directors section of thisreport.
The Executive Board of the Group’s principaloperating entity, Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd.,
is responsible for measuring and supervising market,liquidity, financing and operational risks in theGroup’s financial services activities. Accordingly,
its principal tasks are:
to formulate policies governing market, liquidity,financing and operational risk in the Group’sfinancial services business;
to allocate risl< limits in accordance with
those policies;
===================================================
105.hocr: 
FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
to receive and review reports relating tothose risks.
The Credit Committee of the Executive Boardof Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. is responsible formeasuring and supervising credit risk. In particular,it is responsible for:
formulating policies governing credit risk;making credit business decisions and allocatingcredit limits within the scope of its remit;delegating credit authority;
receiving and reviewing credit risk reports.
To assist its work in monitoring credit risks, the CreditCommittee periodically receives a credit risk reportwhich provides details of the various relevant risks(e.g. concentration risk by issuer and country, ratingdistributions and major positions) as well asinformation on the evolution of credit volumes.
The Information Security Committee 01‘ theExecutive Board of Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. isresponsible both for monitoring and supervisinginformation security risk and for related activitiesfor the purpose of ensuring data confidentialityand integrity.
The Business Conduct and Risk Committee of theExecutive Board of Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd.
is responsible for defining standards 0t conductand processes relating to client relationships,products and services. This Committee also setsguidelines governing the general conduct 0tbusiness and monitors their implementation. Finally,the Committee also ensures that the managementcontrols which monitor such conduct are etfectiveand that they are appropriate to the businessactivities carried out.
The main responsibility for controlling and managingrisks, however, primarily lies with the individualorganisational units. ldentiﬁed risks are mapped toa risk landscape, which provides a consolidatedpicture of the probability of their occurrence and itspotential impact. The risk landscape is also used
by the business areas, the Executive Board and theBoard of Directors of both Julius Baer Group Ltd.and Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. in their annualstrategic planning process.
104
Thanks to its Code of Business Conduct (‘Ourprofessional standards’) as well as a series oftopicAspecific codeeofeconduct guidelines, Julius Baer
has sustainably established its risk culture throughoutthe organisation, A broadibased compendium
of directives and their associated global standardsensures that corporate governance responsibilitiesare met. The global standards are complemented
by commensurate local standards, which articulatethe global principles in more concrete terms and areimplemented by the individual Julius Baer entities.Finally, Julius Baer's management processes ensurethat the Group’s code—oF-conduct principles arecomprehensively observed in day-to—day businessoperations The duties of the units engaged in
risk taking and those responsible For monitoringthose risks are clearly defined, particularly withregard to independence. An important principle hereis to maintain an effective first line of defence
which ensures that the risks taken are appropriatelymanaged by those engaging in them. Risk is anestablished item on the agendas of all divisionalmanagement committees. Secondelineiotidefenceactivities are carried out by independent unitswhose task is to ensure that the framework used formanaging risks meets Group requirements andcomplies with the provisions ofthe law. Their workincludes carrying out independent monitoring ofthe quality of first-line»of—clefence risk management.Internal audit provides the third line of defence
by ensuring that the Group’s business and riskmanagement activities are carried out in accordancewith internal directives and applicable externalregulations.
Risk reporting is carried out in a hierarchicallyappropriate fashion along the chain of managementprocesses and responsibilities described above.
|n particular, Formal rules and procedures governthe risk reports submitted to the various ExecutiveBoard and Board of Directors’ committees as wellas to the Board of Directors itself The risk landscapereferred to above is reviewed and revised each
year. As part of this process, the Executive Boarduses a top-down analysis of the principal strategicand business risks facing the Group and a broad-based bottom-up analysis of its operational risks
in order to define the Group’s risk appetite and risktolerance. This is then submitted to the Board ofDirectors for ratification. The current risk situation

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
CREDIT RISK
Credit or counterparty risk is the risk of a client ora counterparty being either unable, or only partiallyable, to meet an obligation owed to the Group or toan individual Group company. Such nonicompliancemay result in a financial loss to the Group.
The Group has a policy of lending to private clientson a collateralised basis. The credit risk taken onby the Group as a result of such transactions mayarise from lending or from actual or potentialreceivables clue to the Group on client—held positionsin derivatives on foreign exchange, equity, interestrate or commodity products. This credit risk isassessed by reference to a set of rules based onsecurity-specific parameters such as marketcapitalisation, liquidity, issue size, rating, maturity,nature of the underlying asset etc. Advanceablerates can be determined or adjusted for a specificsecurity or for individual clients. As part of the riskmanagement process, clients’ collateral positionsare individually assessed and valued. Dependingon the quality of the collateral and the degree
of diversification within individual client portfolios,an advanceable rate is set for each collateralposition. The overwhelming majority of collateralpositions is revalued every day, thus enabling
the Group's credit positions to be monitored ona daily basis.
The Bank also grants mortgages to existing privatebanking clients in Switzerland and in a limitednumber of international locations where it maintainsa local banking presence. The properties pledgedare assessed and valued individually as part at therisk management process. These valuations arecarried out either on the basis of a factor model orby qualiﬁed internal and external appraisers. Maximummortgage amounts are determined based on
the characteristics of each property and client. Anadditional financial sustainability assessment
is also carried out before a mortgage is granted.
In many cases, supplementary collateral in theform of securities is also required in addition to thepledged property itself. Every mortgage is assigneda rating, which is subject to periodic reviewswhose Frequency is determined by the rating levelsCompared to its competitors, Bank Julius Baer &
106
Co. Ltd‘ tends to assign comparatively low mortgagevalues and adopt a relatively conservative approachto mortgage risk.
In addition, the Group engages in transactions withbanks, brokers and selected institutional clients
on both a secured and unsecured basis. This involvesindividual risk limits and settlement limits beingapproved for each counterparty The credit exposuresarising from these transactions are monitored on
a daily basis, and netting agreements and collateralagreements are also used to mitigate exposuresfurther. As a result, the vast majority of thereplacement values of the exposure arising fromtrading transactions are covered by collateral.
The Group places excess liquidity with central banks.It also makes short-term money—market placementswith banks and invests in high-quality, repo-eligiblebonds and secured debt instruments issued
by governments, public institutions, banks andcorporations, The credit risks associated with allthese counterparties and issuers are subject to awide range of rules and limits. These ensure that
the Group’s consolidated credit exposure, both on asingle-counterparty and a counterparty-group basis:
is not subject to concentration by exposure typeis not disproportionate to the size, shareholdersYequity and scale of business of the counterpartyis clearly within the Group’s risk capacity and theapplicable regulatory limits
The Group settles a substantial proportion of itstrading and derivatives business indirectly throughcentral counterparties (CCPS). The credit risksassociated with CCPs are negligible, because theGroup works through a variety of specialised serviceproviders and therefore generally does not directlyparticipate in the clearing systems concerned.
Given the focused nature of its activities, the Groupis not exposed to any material correlation risk or wrongway risk (Let the risk which arises when exposure to
a counterparty is negatively correlated to its creditquality), Furthermore, the Group holds cashcollateral for the majority of the counterparty riskarising from its open derivatives positions. TheGroup's securities lending business policies explicitlyprohibit transactions involving correlation risk.
===================================================
108.hocr: 
FINANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The Group has a general policy of avoiding grouprating triggers in its collateral agreements forderivatives transactions. As a result, were its ratingto decline below a given level, the Bank would notbe required to provide additional collateral.
Country limits are set in order to contain the riskspotentially arising from country-specitic or region-specitic constellations.
It is not a policy of the Group to engage in corporatelending activities except for collateralised lending
to corporate structures linked to its core privatebanking business.
The Group’s rating concept allows an internal ratingclassification to be assigned to each individualexposure, and it is on these classifications that therelevant limitegranting processes and monitoringare based.
Group management deliberately retrains fromsetting specific volume targets for the strategicdevelopment of its lending business. Instead, itsobjective is to achieve a growth in Lombard lendingcommensurate with the evolution of its wealthmanagement business. To that end, the Board ofDirectors defines corridor values for credit penetration(Le. the ratio of lending to assets under management),In addition, individual maximum lending amountsare defined for each rating category and there isalso an internal guideline for the maximum loan-to-deposit ratio, which is reviewed and validatedperiodically.
The Group has an explicit policy of avoiding non-targeted credit exposure which largely precludesit from lending against nonetraditional forms ofcollateral. In individual cases, exposure at this kindmay be authorised by the Chairman's & RiskCommittee, which may also delegate lower lendinglimits for such transactions to named ofﬁcers.Authorisation of any positions which exceed thedefined limit for individual exposure by ratingcategory can be granted only by the Chairman’s &Risk Committee.
107
Credit risks are monitored on an IT system whichhas been implemented throughout the Group. Thesystem draws the relevant position data from thebookkeeping systems of Group companies whichgrant loans‘ The system is able to enrich this datawith creditespecific information and to consolidate itwith data on client and counterparty positions fromthe various Group booking centres. All client andcounterparty risks are monitored daily, as are currentlimit usage and the quality of the collateral pledged.In addition, for clients with derivatives positionswhose exposure requires intraday monitoring,real-time systems are also available.
The system is able to run comprehensive stress tests.These are calibrated to reflect the prevailing marketand political situation In addition to quantifyingdirect counterparty risks, these stress tests alsoexamine the effect the scenarios would have on
the quality and value of the collateral pledged
for Lombard loans and mortgages. The resultsare reviewed by the creditemonitoring units
and reported to the relevant decisionemakingcommittees.
The credit risk breakdown presented below iscalculated before deduction of eligible collateraland in accordance with Swiss capital adequacyrequirements, which are largely based on theinternational guidelines contained in the BaselCommittee on Banking Supervision’s (BCBS)Basel ||| Accord. Differences between the totalamounts and the corresponding balance sheetpositions are explained in the 'Reconciliation atcredit risk totals’ section of this report.

Reconciliation of credit risk totals
The values shown in the tables above are based
on the requirements of the approaches chosen
in accordance with applicable Swiss regulatoryrequirements, These are based on the capital
adec uacy guidelines of the Basel Committee onBanking Supervision (the Basel ||| BIS approach).Balance sheet and off-balance sheet positionsexposed to credit risks are disclosed, with theexceotion of the following balance sheet positions,whim include non-financial instruments: accruedincome and prepaid expenses, deterred tax assetsand other assets. The list and tables below explainthe cifferences between the total amounts accordingto the Basel ||| BIS approach and the correspondingbalance sheet and oH-balance sheet positions.
T e difference in the due-trom-banks position
is attributable to the fact that under |FRS reverserepurchase positions are recognised on thebalance sheet. This differs from the Basel ||| BlSa aproach, under which reverse repurchasepositions are disclosed as offibalance sheet itemsunder securities lending and repurchasepositions. The credit risk tables have beenadjusted to avoid double counting.
In the financial investments availabIe-tor-saleposition the unrealised gains are deducted fromthe market value under the Basel ||| BIS approach.The total amount of exposure in derivativefinancial instruments under the Basel Hi BIS

approach corresponds to the total ofthe replace-
iiZ
ment values as disclosed in the balance sheet,plus calculated addaons, minus any nettingpermitted under Basel ||| BlS. The addion is
a percentage ofthe notional amount oftheinstrument underlying the contract. Thepercentage depends on the type of the under,lying and the residual term to maturity of thecontract. Positive and negative replacementvalues of derivative exposures with the samecounterparty (irrespective of maturity orcurrency) are netted against each other if
a legally acknowledged netting agreementhas been signed.
Under the Basel ||| BIS approach, the totalcontingent liabilities and irrevocable commit—ments ofF—balance sheet positions correspondto the calculated credit equivalents. The creditequivalent of each ofF-balance sheet positionis determined by multiplying its nominal value(or current value should this be lower) by acrediticonversion factor‘ The conversion factordepends on the original maturity of the contract.The contingent liabilities and irrevocablecommitments as presented in the credit risktables do not qualify as contingent liabilitiesunder IFRS‘
Under the Basel ||| BIS approach, securitieslending and repurchase transactions are disclosedincluding risk premiums The percentage ofthe risk premium depends on the quality of thesecurity involved in each securities lending orrepo transaction.

FINANCiAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The following table provides an analysis of theGroup’s exposure to credit risk by credit quality andcontains data from the internal credit supervisionsystem used for the calculation and monitoring ofthe Group’s exposure to credit risk. Credit exposure
is measured against the following two types of limits:
a) risk limits for unsecured credit exposures, whichapply mainly to banks and brokers, but also includeselected non-financial institutions issuing debtsecurities; and b) Lombard and mortgage limits forcollateralised credit exposures, which relate mainlyto private clients.
In this analysis, credit exposure primarily comprisesthe following elements: cash exposure (such asadvances, account overdrafts, cash balances withcorrespondent banks, etc), derivatives exposure(replacement value plus add—on), and issuer riskfrom debt securities held in the Group’s investmentand treasury books. Exposure From reverse repo
and securities lending transactions is not included inthis credit exposure analysis, since these positionsare overicollateralised on a net basis and thereforedo not constitute credit risk. in this context, over?collateralised on a net basis means that, in eachtransaction, the value 01‘ the collateral provided(without regulatory standard haircuts being applied)exceeds the value of the securities lent (without
US
a risk premium being applied). Intraday settlementexposures are also not included in the creditexposure analysis These are monitored separately.The credit exposure arising from the trading book,which is insignificant compared to that arising Fromthe positions listed above, is also not included inthis analysis.
For the purpose of this analysis, client debit
and credit cash balances across different accountsare netted against each other. Derivatives positionsare netted, provided a number of conditions aremet which justify such netting on economic grounds(eg. that they have the same underlying asset,
the same maturity, the same nominal amount etc).However, the credit exposure arising from thisanalysis also includes add-ons which are requiredfor derivatives positions and which are generallyhigher than those required by the regulators. Forthat reason the credit exposure calculations belowdeviate from those calculated for regulatory purposes.
Counterparty derivatives exposures are nettedacross different products, accounts, branches andcollateral positions provided the relevant ISDA
and CSA closeout netting master agreements havebeen signed.

1 Risk management estimates the collective allowance for credit losses to be lower in 2017 mostly due to additional and more accurate input Factors used for
the determination.
The internal credit ratings R17R1O form the basisFor calculating allowances for credit losses. Loans,receivables and other exposures are allocated to oneof the ten rating classes. In the case of rating classesR1—R6, the outstanding balances are serviced, theadvanceable value of the collateral (at fair value)pledged for collateralised exposures equals orexceeds the balances, and repayment ofthe balanceis not in doubt. For these exposures, only collectiveallowances for credit losses are established. Balancesin rating class R7 are past due, but the exposure is
116
still covered by collateral, and specific allowancesare established only For pastidue interest payments.For balances in rating class R8, speciﬁc allowancesfor credit losses are established if it is more likelythan not that a loss will arise. The credit risks inrating classes R9 and R10 are very high, and specificallowances for credit losses are established forbalances in these rating classes, The extent ofthecredit-loss allowances required in such cases isdetermined by a credit expert on an individual basisand authorised by the relevant credit authority.

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
All risk reports in the area of market risk areproduced daily on a consolidated basis and reportedto the responsible Executive Board members.
On a monthly basis, an integrated market risk reportis provided to the Executive Board. The Chairman’s& Risk Committee of the Board of Directors isinformed quarterly about market risk exposures.
Market risk limits are set on a Group level andallocated to the single trading units depending onthe nature and magnitude of the market risks inthese organisations. Our primary measure of marketrisk is the value at risk ‘VaR’ complemented byscenario analysis and sensitivity values.
Trading-book market risk is primarily measured bythe position-keeping and risk management systemsused by the trading department. In addition, thesepositions are also independently measured by themarket risk management unit reporting to the CRO.This unit uses a central |T system which is continiuously developed and expanded. The systemsupports the calculation otthe marketirisk andscenari07analysis metrics used. These results areanalysed on a daily basis and limit controls arecarried out‘ Any breach of these limits is investigatedin a timely fashion. That system also forms the basisfor the external regulatory reporting.
The exposure arising from certain particular risks isalso monitored during the trading day and checkedagainst applicable limits.
Foreign exchange risks arising from positions in thebanking book are also subject to market risk limits.
Trading and hedging strategies
The Group entities engage in trading transactions,both as principal and agent, in foreign exchange,precious metals, money market, ﬁxed income,equities, commodities, traditional and nonitraditionalfund products, and in credit markets. Tradingactivities are pursued with the intention ofbenefiting, in the short term, from actual orexpected differences between the opening and
118
closing price of proprietary positions, with theintention of benefiting from arbitrage profits, orwith the intention of hedging risks from positionsmeeting aforementioned criteria.
The overall trading strategies are outlined in adedicated policy and detailed in mandates for singletrading books, including hedging strategies. Theeffectiveness of hedging strategies is continuouslyassured by setting and monitoring trading limits.Regular detailed book reviews by the risk managementfunction supplement the assurance of effectivehedging activities
Market risk measurement, market risk limitation,back testing and stress testing
The following methods are used to measure andlimit market risk: value at risk (VaR) limits, sensitivityor concentration limits (delta, vega, basispoint
and nominal limits as well as scenario analysis), andcountry limits for trading positions. VaR, the key
risk figure, measures the magnitude of the loss on aportfolio that, under normal circumstances and for
a specific probability (confidence interval), will notbe exceeded during the observed holding period.The VaR of the Group amounted to CHF 1.03 millionon 31 December 2017 (one-day holding period, 95%confidence interval). The maximum VaR recorded
in 2017 amounted to CHF 2.95 million; the mini-mum was CHF 0.93 million‘ The adequacy of theVaR calculation, which is based on historical marketmovements, is monitored through regular backtesting. This involves the comparison otthe VaRvalues calculated each day with the hypotheticalgains or losses which would have occurred if theend—ot-day positions had been left unchanged onthe next trading clay. The following chart shows thedaily calculations of VaR in 2017 (at confidenceintervals of 95% and 99% and for a oneiday holdingperiod) compared with these hypothetical gains orlosses A backetesting excession occurs when thechange in overall position value resulting from theback-testing simulation is negative and its absolutevalue is greater than the VaR (at a confidence intervalof 99%) for the relevant day’s closing positions.

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
Whereas VaR forecasts identify potential lossesduring normal market conditions, daily stress
tests are carried out in order to estimate the consequences of extreme market swings. Limits are
set for both these risk metrics and their utilisation
is monitored on a daily basis. The daily stress testsare periodically complemented by additional testsbased on historical scenarios. Additional stress tests,reflecting speciﬁc market and political situations, arealso carried out.
At the beginning of 2017, the preceding twelve-monthperiod contained no back-testing excessions. During2017, the number of back-testing excessions rose
to two The First, in April, was caused by increasedmarket volatility attributable to the Frenchpresidential elections The second, in August,
was the result of a one-day rally in share prices ofbetween 1% and 1.7%. As a result, the number
of statistically permissible backetesting excessionsduring the period was not exceeded.
All backetesting excessions are examined individuallyand each is reported to the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer,the Chief Risk Officer, the internal and external
auditors and the Swiss Financial Market SupervisoryAuthority (FINMA).
VaR method and regulatory capital
For its VaR calculation, the Group uses historicalsimulation with complete revaluation at all tradingpositions in each instance. The historical simulationis based on empirically observed changes in marketparameters (prices, yield curves, volatilities) over thelast EOO-trading-day period. As a result, correlationis taken into account implicitly, without having
to draw on calculations and assumptions basedon a correlation matrix. The risk managementplatform and the internal market risk models of theGroup fulfil the relevant regulatory requirementsand have been approved by FINMA tor use indetermining the capital requirement tor marketrisks in the trading book.
120
In addition to the normal VaR calculations detailedabove, a scecalled stresSebased VaR calculation
is also carried out. Instead of the historical pricesobserved over the last 300 trading days, thisstreSSebased VaR calculation uses those observedduring a highly volatile period in the past (thestress period). The Group’s stress-based VaRamounted to CHF 1.45 million on 31 December2017 (for a one»day holding period and a 95%confidence interval). The maximum stress—basedVaR recorded in 2017 amounted to CHF 3.69million; the minimum was CHF 1.16 million. UnderFl N MA regulations, the capital requirement formarket risk is the sum otthe normal VaR and thestress—based VaRt
FINMA applies a multiplier to the capital require-ment for market risk. Every back-testing excessionover and above the statistically based maximumpermitted number of excessions (four over a periodof 250 trading days) results in an increase in themultiplier applied to the capital requirement formarket risk. There were two backetesting excessionsto report by the end of2017. For additionalinformation regarding the calculation ofthe Group’sminimum regulatory capital requirements underBasel ||| Pillar 3, refer to the separate Basel ||| Pillar 3Report published in the Regulatory Disclosuressection of the www.juliusbaemom website (this willbe available at the end of April 2018).
Given the limited materiality 0f the positionsconcerned, the specific risk of the Group’s fixed-income trading positions is calculated according
to the standard method. The incremental risk chargeand comprehensive risk-capital charge requirementsare not applicable.

FINANCING, LIQUIDITY AND INTERESTRATE RISKS IN THE BANKING BOOK
Financing risk is the risk of the Group being unableto finance its existing or planned activities on anongoing basis at acceptable prices. Liquidity risk,conversely, is the risk ofthe Group being unable tomeet its payment obligations when they tall due.Interest rate risk is defined as the ettect 01‘ potentialchanges in interest rates on the market value of theGroup's assets and liabilities.
Governance
The Treasury department of Bank Julius Baer & Co,Ltd. manages the Group’s ﬁnancing, liquidity andinterest rate risks on an integrated basis, with BankJulius Baer & Co. Ltd. acting as the Group’s centralliquidity provider. The Treasury departmentproposes the strategy For managing the ﬁnancing,liquidity and interest rate risks and submits this
to the Group’s Asset and Liability ManagementCommittee (ALMCO)1‘orapproval. Limitsforfinancing, liquidity and interest rate risks are definedat Group level. These are reviewed at least onceannually and approved by the Board of Directorsand the Group ALMCO. The Group’s consolidatedexposure to financing, liquidity and interest rate risks
121
is reported to the Group ALMCO at least once amonth‘ The particular liquidity and interest raterisks to which Bank Julius Beer & Co. Ltd. is exposedare monitored and managed on a daily basis,
as are those of the other Group companies. TheTreasury Risk Control unit provides independentreports on the relevant risk positions for thispurpose.
The interest rate and liquidity stress risk of thebanking book is measured by a global riskmanagement and reporting platform, Every day,the positions are independently measured in an iTsystem maintained by the Treasury Risk Control
unit and reported back to the Group companies withsubstantial risks on their books. The local treasuryand risk control units are responsible for localimplementation and adherence to limits. The GroupTreasurer has continuous access to the Group’sconsolidated positions and can manage them on aGroup-wide basis The relevant data is drawn fromthe book-keeping systems for the Group companies’banking books. The system supports the calculationof the usual interest-rate-risk and liquidity-stressmetrics. These results are analysed on a daily basisand limit controls are carried out. Any breach
of these limits is investigated in a timely fashion.

Here, too, broadibased Groupawide stress tests arecarried out based on the current market and politicalsituation. Examples include scenarios resulting in
an abrupt increase in interest rates. In addition tosuch immediate consequences as the change in
the market value of the treasury bond portfolio,these scenarios also take account of longer-termeffects such as changes in net interest earnings andhigher refinancing costs.
Management of liquidity and financing risksThe objective of the Group's liquidity riskmanagement is to maintain a healthy liquidityposition which enables the Group to meet all
its obligations when they fall due and to maintainsufficient flexibility to be able to react to company-specific stress situations in tight market conditions.
A liquidity stress scenario is modelled, which, over
a time horizon of 30 days, essentially simulatessubstantial outflows of client deposits which wouldbe stable under normal circumstances and theGroup’s ability to compensate for these by sellinghighly liquid investments and taking other appropriatemeasures. This scenario models an extreme stresssituation combining company-specific stress eventswith tight market conditions. It is calculated on adaily basis
To complement the analysis provided by the liquiditystress scenario, a variety of early warning indicatorsare monitored with respect to the current liquidityposition.
Switzerland's Liquidity Ordinance and FINMA’s‘Liquidity Risks — Banks’ circular make it a regulatoryrequirement for the Group to calculate and monitorits Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR). The LCR providesbanks with a metric to assist them in ensuring thatthey hold a sufficient quantity of highly liquid assetsto enable them to withstand a shortiterm (ZOeday)company~specific stress situation which coincideswith a period ofgeneral market stress. During 2017,the Group’s LCR fluctuated between 105% and180%, which puts it signiﬁcantly above the minimum
122
statutory requirement of 80%. For additionalquantitative information relating to the LCR,refer to the separate Basel ||| Pillar 3 Reportpublished in the Regulatory Disclosures sectionofthe www.juliusbaercom website (this will beavailable at the end oprri12018).
In managing its financing risks, the Group aims
to ensure that it has access to appropriate sourcesof financing at all times At present, the Group’sactivities are largely financed by client sight deposits.Given its active participation in the interbankmarket, the Group would, however, quickly be ableto access additional sources of refinancing at
any time In addition, the Group issues variousbonds.
The Group’s liquidity risk management arrange—ments set out an emergency plan which Forms anintegral part of its global crisis concept. Thisemergency plan includes an overview of alternativesources of financing and liquidity metrics, as wellas a range of emergency measures.
Management of interest rate risks
One measure of interest rate risk can be providedby showing the impact of a positive change of1%(+100 basis points) in the entire yield curve in therespective currency, The table below, broken downaccording to maturity bands and currencies, showsthe results of such a scenario as at 31 December2017. Negative values under this scenario reflect apotential drop in fair value within the respectivematurity band; positive values reflect a potentialincrease in Fair value. This risk measure is also usedto carry out scenario analyses on a regular basis.As there are no material option structures in thebanking book, a negative change of 1% in the yieldcurves would result in scenario values of similarmagnitude but with the opposite sign, thoughsuch outcomes are mitigated by the fact that theyield curves for the markets in which the Groupcarries out most of its activities are currently closeto zero.

In addition, the effect on interest earnings resultingfrom a parallel shift of 1% in the yield curve ismeasured.

Based on the assumptions describedabove, and further assuming that the Group took nomitigating action, the modelled effect on interestearnings would have been CHF 429.8 million at theend of 2017 (2016: CHF -180.0 million).
Hedging interest rate risks
The Group accepts deposits Trom clients at bothfloating and fixed rates and for various periods
and either lends these Funds on a collateralised basis
123
or invests them in highiquality assets. By consolidatingthe short-term money deposited by clients andlending it out at longer maturities, an effort is
made to increase the interest margin. At the sametime, sufficient liquid assets are held in order to
be always able to meet all maturing obligations.
In managing the associated interest rate risks,
the Group applies Fair value hedges for hedging aportion 01: the interest rate exposure by employinginterest rate swaps. The market value of these
swaps on 31 December 2017 amounted to a netCHF $0.8 million (2016: CHF -61.1 million). The
fair value gain on the hedged mortgages attributableto the hedged interest rate risk amounted to
CHF 32.6 million (2016: CHF 58.0 million).

OPERATIONAL RISK
Operational risk is defined as the risk of lossesarising as a result either ofthe inadequacy orfailure of internal processes, people or systems oras a consequence of external events.
Framework for the management
of operational risk
The framework used to manage and limit operationalrisk is defined by the Group Risk Managementfunction. This framework is based on a structuredapproach whose objective is to apply a set ofuniform standards and methodologies For identi—fying, evaluating, monitoring, controlling andreporting risks across the Group. A further objectiveis to allow individual business areas and legal entitiessufficient Flexibility to adapt the specific componentsof this framework to meet their particular needswhile at the same time ensuring that Groupewideminimum standards continue to be met.
===================================================
128.hocr: 
FINANCiAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
The key components of this framework are describedbelow:
7 Organisational structure: the tasks,
responsibilities and processes for managingoperational risk, and the relevant escalationprocedures relating thereto, are set out in aseries of directives, guidelines and manuals.Willingness to assume risk and levels of risktolerance: operational risk appetite and theunderlying level of operational risk tolerance aredetermined by the Board of Directors and theExecutive Board as part of their annual reviewof the overall risk landscape. The processes formonitoring risk appetite and the level of risktolerance include directives, limits and definedlevels of authority, which are also reflected inthe Group’s business strategy and personnelpolicy.
Control system: the control environment whichhas been established to manage operationalrisk requires that activities are carried out inaccordance with deﬁned directives andguidelines and that processes operate asspecified. Under this approach, controls areintegrated into business processes whereverpossible. Key controls are carried out in a timelyfashion and their results are monitored by RiskManagement. In addition, the quality andcompleteness of certain key controls is subject toindependent veriﬁcation, which ensures that theirspecifications and effectiveness are assessed ona regular basis. In addition there are independentcontrol functions in place that monitor certainspecific operational risks.
Register of operational risks: the individual legalentities maintain operational risk registers listingthe operational risks which have been identifiedas inherent to their speciﬁc business activitiesand the measures which have been put in placeto eliminate or reduce them. These operationalrisks are classified and evaluated according
to a uniform, Group-wide risk taxonomy and auniform quantitative risk evaluation templatecharting potential risks and the probability oftheir occurrence.
Record of operational risk events: Lossesarising as a result of operational risk arerecorded by Risk Management in a Group-widedatabase. Evaluation of these events enables
127
operational weaknesses to be identiﬁed sothat appropriate measures can be taken toremedy them‘
7 Self evaluation of risks and of the quality of thecontrol system: these self evaluations are carriedout by the individual specialised areas and legalentities with the assistance of Risk Management.The process involves applying a uniform risktaxonomy to identify inherent operational risksand their causes, to evaluate the effectiveness ofthe controls and other risk-minimising measuresin place and to determine the level of residualrisk The results of these self evaluations areincorporated into the Group-wide risk landscapewhich is presented to the Executive Board, theChairman’s & Risk Committee and the AuditCommittee each year.
— Risk information consolidation process: the riskmanagers have unrestricted access to all theinformation they require to identify and evaluateoperational risks in the areas for which they areresponsible. This includes internal and externalaudit reports, data on operational losses,information from risk committees, quantitativerisk indicators (Key Risk Indicators), controlresults, complaints from clients and other internaland external risk information. The resultingoperational risk evaluation and the extent towhich risk-minimising measures have beenimplemented are regularly reviewed and updatedby the risk manager and those responsible tormanaging the business areas concerned. Afurther objective otthese discussions is toidentify potential new risks at an early stage andto determine possible initiatives to address them.
— Reporting to senior management: a number offormal risk reports are submitted to managementand the Board of Directors. These reportsincorporate the key insights and developmentsrelating to operational risks, thus ensuring thattimely and appropriate action can be taken inresponse to operational risk events and to anyactivities which exceed current levels ofoperational risk appetite.
Given the diversity of operational activities carriedout by the Group, it is not possible for them all
to be covered by one single overarching system.Instead, information on individual topics is collectedbased on its specific content and the needs of those
===================================================
129.hocr: 
FiNANCiAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017COMMENT ON RISK AND CAPITAL MANAGEMENT
to whom it needs to be addressed. This informationis then aggregated by topic and collated forsubmission to the relevant committees andmanagement teams. Data from centrally managedsystems which have been rolled out across theGroup, such as the directives database, the auditdatabase, the operational risk register and theoperational loss database can be consolidateddirectly. Data from decentralised systems, such
as the plans for local key inventory checks, is collatedcentrally and appropriately aggregated.
A self assessment of operational risks is carried
out which implicitly simulates an adverse what—itstress scenariot For each individual category of risk,the scenario assesses what could potentially occur.This assessment is continuously updated to takeaccount of the activities carried out in the frameworkdescribed above.
The Group calculates its minimum regulatory capitalrequirement for operational risks according to thestandard approach under article 90 of the CapitalAdequacy Ordinance.
Business Continuity Management
The objective of the Business Continuity Manage-ment (BCM) Programme is to establish andmaintain the stability of the overall organisation inthe event of massive disturbances to its operationsand in crisis situations. The programme aims toprotect the Group’s reputation and to minimiseany financial loss to clients, the Group and itsemployees. To that end, the Group has formulateda BCM strategy and implemented a set at Group—wide BCM directives and guidelines, which assignBCM tasks and responsibilities across the Groupand define the structure of the crisis managementorganisation. These directives and guidelines alsodefine the processes for planning, analysing andassessing recovery and continuity measures, andthe procedures for communication and internaltraining,
The BCM Programme is based on national andinternational standards (such as ISO standards)and on the business continuity recommendations
i28
formulated by the Swiss Bankers’ Association, someof which have been defined as compulsory byFINMA. The programme also reﬂects local BCMrequirements applicable to BCMerelevant businessunits outside Switzerland.
Regular crisis organisation exercises are conductedto assess the effectiveness of these measures, andregular internal and external audits are carried outto review the content of the programme.
Legal and compliance risk
eegal risk essentially comprises default and liabilityrisk. Default risk is defined as the risk of Financial orother loss or injury resulting from a Group companyoeing unable to enforce existing or anticipatedrights, most commonly contractual rights, againstthird parties. Liability risk, on the other hand, ariseswhen a Group company, or someone acting on itsDehalf, fails to meet an obligation owed to a thirdaarty or fails to respect the rights of a third party.
Regulatory or compliance risk is the risk of financialor other loss or injury resulting from a breach ofapplicable laws and regulations or the departure
rom internal or external codes of conduct or marketpractice. The loss or injury in such circumstancesmay take the form of fines imposed by regulatoryauthorities or other sanctions such as restrictions
on business activities or the imposition of mandatoryremedial measures.

Measures aimed at minimising legal and regulatoryor compliance risks include raising Staff awarenessof legal and regulatory issues through training andinternal directives and controls to ensure adherenceto the legal and regulatory requirements withinwhich the Group operates.
As described in the risk governance section of thisreport, the General Counsel and the Chief RiskOfficer coordinate the management and control oflegal and compliance risks Legal and compliancerisks are regularly reported to the Board of Directors.In line with the development ofthe legal andregulatory environment of the industry, the Grouphas consistently invested in personnel and technical

MANAGEMENT OF CAPITAL INCLUDINGREGULATORY CAPITAL
In managing its capital, the Group considers avariety of requirements and expectations. Sutficientcapital must be in place to support current andprojected business activities, according to both theGroup’s own internal assessment and the require,ments of its regulators, in particular its lead regulator,the Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority(FINMA), Capital is also managed in order to achievesound capital ratios and to ensure a strong externalcredit rating.
Ensuring compliance with minimum regulatorycapital requirements and targeted capital ratios iscentral to capital adequacy management. In thisongoing process, the Group manages its capital onthe basis of target capital ratios for common equitytierl capital and total capital. In the target settingprocess the Group takes into account the regulatoryminimum capital requirements and regulatoryexpectations that the Group will hold additionalcapital above the minimum required for eachcapital category, the Group’s internal assessmentof aggregate risk exposure requiring equitycapital provision, the views of rating agencies,and comparison to peer institutions based on

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017INFORMATION ON THE CONSOLIDATED BALANCE SHEET
The Group’s approach to determine the key assumptions and related growth expectations is based
on management’s knowledge and reasonableexpectations of future business, using internal
and external market information, planned and/orstarted business initiatives and other reasonableintentions of management. For that purpose, theGroup uses historical information by taking intoconsideration the current and expected marketsituations as well as the current and expected futurerelative market position of the Group vis-é-vis
its respective competitors and in its industry. Thelong-term growth rate beyond the planninghorizon for assets under management is assumed
at 1% For all cash-generating units. This growthrate is considerably below the actual average rate
of the last five years
Changes in key assumptions
Deviations of future actual results achieved vs.forecast/plannecl key assumptions, as well as futurechanges of any of the key assumptions based on
a future different assessment of the developmentof relevant markets, and/or businesses, may occur.Such deviations may result From changes in productsand client mix, profitability, required types andintensity of personnel resources, general and
144
companyespecific personnel cost development and/or changes in the implementation of known oraddition of new business initiatives and/or otherinternal and/or external factors. These changes
may cause the value of the business to alter andtherefore either increase or reduce the differencebetween the carrying value in the balance sheet andthe unit’s recoverable amount or may even lead to apartial impairment of goodwill.
Management has performed sensitivity analyseson the discount rates and growth rates applied to aforecast period. Under these scenarios, thereasonably possible changes in key assumptionswould not result in the carrying amount exceedingthe recoverable amount except for the smallestCGU GPS. For this CGU, the value in use couldstart falling below the carrying amount if thediscount rate used in the calculation is increased by2% or the terminal growth rate is decreased by 2%.
Therefore, no impairment resulted from theseanalyses. However, there remains a degree ofuncertainty involved in the determination oftheseassumptions due to the general market andbusinessspecific environment.

As a result, the stated interest rategenerally does not reflect the effective interest ratepaid to service the debt after the embeddedderivative has been separated.

As the redemption amount on the structured debtissues is linked to changes in stock prices, indices,currencies or other assets, the Group cannotdetermine the difference between the carryingamount and the amount the Group would becontractually required to pay at maturity to theholder ofthe structured debt issues.
Changes in the fair value of financial liabilitiesdesignated at fair value are attributable to changesin the market risk factors of the embedded derivatives.The credit rating of the Bank had no material impacton the fair value changes of these liabilities.

Introduction
The Group operates in a legal and regulatoryenvironment that exposes it to significantlitigation, compliance, reputational and other risksarising from disputes and regulatory proceedings.
Non»comp|iance with regulatory requirements mayresult in regulatory authorities taking enforcementaction or initiating criminal proceedings againstthe Group and its employees. Possible sanctionscould include the revocation of licences to operatecertain businesses, the suspension or expulsionfrom a particularjurisdiction or market of any
of the Group's business organisations or their
key personnel and the imposition of fines, thedisgorgement of profit and censures on companiesand employees. In certain markets, authorities,such as regulatory authorities, may determine thatindustry practices, e.g. regarding the provision ofservices, are or have become inconsistent with their
interpretations of existing local laws and regulations.
Also, from time to time, the Group is confrontedwith information and clarification requests Fromauthorities with respect to certain topics. TheGroup principally cooperates with the competentauthorities within the confines of applicable laws toclarify the situation while protecting its owninterests.
152
The risks described below may not be the onlyrisks to which the Group is exposed. The additionalrisks not presently known or risks and proceedingscurrently deemed immaterial may also impair
the Group’s future business, results of operations,financial condition and prospects. The realisationof one or more ofthese risks may individually
or together with other circumstances materiallyadversely affect the Group's business, results
of operations, financial condition and prospects.
Legal proceedings/contingent liabilities
The Group is involved in various legal, regulatoryand administrative proceedings concerning mattersarising within the course of normal business oper—ations. The current business environment involvessubstantial legal and regulatory risks, the impact
of which on the financial position or proﬁtability
of the Group 7 depending on the status of relatedproceedings 7 is difficult to assess.
The Group establishes provisions for pending andthreatened legal proceedings if the management isof the opinion that such proceedings are more likelythan not to result in a financial obligation or loss, orif the dispute for economic reasons should be settledwithout acknowledgment of any liability on the partof the Group and if the amount of such obligationor loss can already be reasonably estimated.

In rare cases in which the amount cannot be estimatedreIiany due to the early stage of the proceedings, thecomplexity of the proceedings and/or other factors,no provision is recognised but the case is disclosedas a contingent liability as of 31 December 2017. Thecontingent liabilities might have a material effect
on the Group or for other reasons might be of interestfor investors and other stakeholders.
In 2010 and 2011, litigation was commencedagainst Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. (the ‘Bank')and numerous other financial institutions by theliquidators of the Fairfield funds (the ‘Fain‘ieldLiquidators’), having acted as feeder Funds for
the Maclofic fraudulent investment schemes. In
the direct claims against the Bank, the FairfieldLiquidators are seeking to recover a total amountof approximately USD 64 million in the courts ofNew York (including USD 17 million that relates toredemption payments made to clients of ING Bank(Suisse) SA, which merged with the Bank in 2010,and approximately USD 25 million that relates
to redemption payments made to clients of MerrillLynch Bank (Suisse) SA, which merged with theBank in 2013, such claims being subject toacquisition-related representation and warrantiesprovisions). The proceedings in the courts of theBritish Virgin Islands, where an amount of approxi-mately USD 8.5 million have been claimed from theBank, were finally dismissed in favour of the Bankwith a ruling of the Privy Council, the highest courtof appeals for the British Virgin Islands. In additionto the direct claims against the Bank, the FairfieldLiquidators have made combined claims in theamount otapproximately USD 1.8 billion againstmore than 80 defendants. Only a fraction 01‘ thisamount is sought against the Bank and its beneficialowners. The combined cIaims aggregate thedamages asserted against all defendants, such thata reliable allocation of the claimed amounts betweenthe Bank and the other defendants cannot be madeat this time. Finally, in further proceedings, the trusteeof Madoff’s broker-dealer company (the ‘Trustee’)seeks to recover over USD 83 million in the courtsof New York (including USD 46 million that relatesto redemption payments made to clients of MerrillLynch Bank (Suisse) SA, which merged with theBank in 2013, such claims being subject to acquisition-reIated representation and warranties provisions),largely in relation to the same redemption payments
153
which are the subject matter of the claims assertedby the Fairfield Liquidators. Most of the aforemenitionecI proceedings are in preliminary proceduralstages, The Bank is challenging these actions onprocedural and substantive grounds and has takenfurther measures to defend and protect its interests.In the proceedings initiated by the Trustee, theBankruptcy Court in New York dismissed the caseagainst the Bank and other defendants based onextraterritoriality principles in November 2016. TheTrustee has appealed this ruling.
In a landmark decision on so-caIIed retrocessions,the Swiss Federal Supreme Court ruled in 2012that the receipt of Fund trailer Fees by a bank inconnection with a Discretionary Portfolio Manage—ment mandate may create a potential conflict ofinterest in the execution of the mandate. The Courtconsidered that by receiving trailer fees in thecontext 0 such mandate, a bank may be inclined notwe best interest of the client. Therefore,applicable Swiss mandate law a bank shallnot only account for fund trailer fees obtained
from thirc parties in connection with a client’smandate, but also be obliged to forward respectiveamounts to a client, provided the client has notvaIidIy waived to reclaim such fees. Bank Julius Baer& Cot Ltc‘ has assessed this decision by the SwissFederal Supreme Court, other relevant courtdecisions in this context and the mandate structures
to act in tbased on
to which the Court decisions might be applicableand the cof respective waivers and the communicated
ocumentation as well as the impact

bandwidt 15 having been introduced some yearsago, and implemented appropriate measures toaddress the matter.
Bank Julius Baer & Co. Ltd. is confronted with aclaim by the quuidator of a foreign corporationarguing that the Bank did not prevent two 01‘ itsclients from embezzling assets of the foreigncorporation. In this context, the quuidator as of 2013presented draft complaints with different claimamounts for a potential Swiss proceeding and Filed apayment order (‘Betreibungsbegehren’) against theBank in the amount of CHF 422 million (plus accruedinterest from 2009). On 8 February 2017, the Bankhas been served with a claim from said corporationin liquidation in the amount of EUR 306 million. Thecourt proceeding against the Bank has been initiated

The Group maintains various defined contributionand defined benefit pension plans in Switzerlandand abroad, The pension plans in Switzerland havebeen set up on the basis of the Swiss method ofdefined contributions under the Swiss pension law.Employees and pensioners or their survivors receivestatutorily determined beneﬁts upon leaving theGroup or retiring as well as in the event of death orinvalidity. These beneﬁts are the result of theconversion rate applied on the accumulated balanceof the individual plan participant’s pension accountat the retirement date. The accumulated balanceequals the sum of the regular employer’s andemployee's contribution that have been made duringthe employment period, including the accruedinterest on these amounts. However, these plans donot fulfil all the criteria of a deﬁned contributionpension plan according to IAS 19 and are thereforetreated as defined beneﬁt pension plans tor thepurpose of the Group’s financial statements.
158
The pension obligations are largely covered throughpension plan assets of pension funds that are legallyseparated and independent from the Group. In casethe plans become significantly underfunded over anextended time period according to the Swiss pensionlaw basis, the Group and the employees share therisk of additional payments into the pension fund.The pension funds are managed by a board of trusteesconsisting of representatives of the employees andthe employer. Management of the pension Fundsincludes the pursuit of a medium- and Iong-termconsistency and sustainability between the pensionplans’ assets and liabilities, based on a diversiﬁedinvestment strategy correlating with the maturityofthe pension obligations. The organisation,management, financing and investment strategy
of the pension plans comply with the legalrequirements, the foundation charters and theapplicable pension regulations.

The following methods are used in measuringthe fair value of ﬁnancial instruments in thebalance sheet:
Short-term financial instruments
Financial instruments with a maturity or a refinancingprofile of one year or less are generally classified asshort»term. This applies for the balance sheet itemscash and money market instruments. Depending
on the maturity, it also includes the following: duefrom banks, loans, due to banks, due to customersand debt issued. For short-term financial instrumentswhich do not have a market price published by arecognised stock exchange or notable market(referred to hereinafter as a market price),
the carrying value generally approximates the Fairvalue
168
Long-term financial instruments
Depending on the maturity, these include theJfollowing balance sheet items: due From banks, loans,due to banks, due to customers and debt issued. TheJfair value of longeterm financial instruments whichhave a maturity or a refinancing profile of more thanone year is derived by using the net present valuemethod. Generally, the Libor rate is used to calculatethe net present value of the loans, as these assetsare fully collateralised and therefore the specificcounterparty risk has no material impact on the fairvalue measurement.

258 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS , FAIR VALUE DETERMINATION
Leve|1
For trading assets as well as for certain financialinvestments availableiforisale and exchangeitradedderivatives whose prices are quoted in an activemarket, the fair value is determined directly fromthe quoted market prices.
Level 2
For financial instruments for which quoted marketprices are not directly available or are not derivedFrom active markets, fair values are estimated usingvaluation techniques or models based whereverpossible on assumptions supported by observablemarket prices or rates existing on the balance sheetdate This is the case for the majority of OTC deriva-tives, most unquotecl financial instruments, andother items that are not traded in active markets.The main pricing models and valuation techniquesapplied to these ﬁnancial instruments includeforward pricing and swap models using present?value calculations, and option models such as
the Blackischoles model. The values derived fromapplying these models and techniques are significantlyimpacted by the choice of the valuation modelused and the underlying assumptions made,
such as the amounts and timing oic Future cashflows, discount rates, volatility, or credit risk.
Level 3
For certain financial instruments, neither quotedmarket prices nor valuation techniques or modelsbased on observable market prices are available fordetermining the fair value. in these cases, tair valueis estimated indirectly using valuation techniques ormodels based on reasonable assumptions reflectingmarket conditions.
Financial investments availableiforisa/e: The Groupholds certain equity instruments, which are requiredfor the operation ofthe Group and are reported
as financial instruments available-for-sale, withchanges in the fair value recognised in othercomprehensive income. The determination of thefair value is based on the published net asset valueof the investees. The net asset values are adjustedby management for any necessary impacts fromevents which may have an influence on the valuation
169
(adjusted net asset method). In 2017, dividendsrelated to these investments in the amount of
CHF 67 million (2016: CHF 7.3 million) have beenrecognised in the income statement.
Financial instruments designated at fair value: TheGroup issues to its private clients certain specificstructured notes, which are intended to be Fullyinvested in private equity investments. Since thenotes may not be fully invested in private equity
as from the beginning, the portion currently
not yet invested is placed in money marketinstruments, short-term debt funds, or held incash. Although the clients contractually bear
all the related risks and rewards from the underlyinginvestments, these financial instruments are notderecognised from the Group’s balance sheetdue to the strict derecognition criteria required
by IFRS. Therefore, the private equity investmentsas well as the money market instruments arerecorded as financial assets designated at Fairvalue, Any changes in the fair value or any otherincome from the private equity investments, aswell as any income related to the money marketinstruments, are recorded in the income statement.However, as the clients are entitled to all rewardsrelated to the investments, these amounts net outin the respective line item in the income statement.Hence, any change in the valuation inputs has
no impact on the Group's income statement orshareholders’ equity.
To measure the fair values otthe private equityinvestments, the Group generally relies on thevaluations as provided by the respective privateequity Funds managing the investments. These tundsin turn use their own valuation techniques, such asmarket approaches or income approaches, includingtheir own input factors into the applied models.Therefore, the private equity investments arereported in level 3 of the fair value hierarchy, as
the fair values are determined based on models withunobservable market inputs, The related issuednotes are reported as financial liabilities designatedat fair value and classified as level 3 instruments,due to the related private equity investments beingpart of the valuation otthe notes.

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
25D FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS , OFFSETTING
As a private bank, the Group aims to enter intosecurities transactions and derivative Financialinstruments, In order to control the credit exposureand reduce the credit risk related to these transactions,the Group applies credit mitigation strategies inthe ordinary course of business. The Group entersinto master netting agreements with counterpartiesto mitigate the credit risk of securities lending andborrowing transactions, repurchase and reverserepurchase transactions and over-the-counterderivative transactions. Such arrangements includeGlobal Master Securities Lending Agreements orGlobal Master Repurchase Agreements, as well asISDA Master Agreements for derivatives.
The majority of exposures to securities transactionsand overitheecounter derivative financialinstruments are collateralised, with the collateralbeing prime financial instruments or cash.
However, under IFRS, to be able to offset transactionswith the same counterparty on the balance sheet,the right of set-off must not only be legally enforce-able in the normal course of business, but must
also be enforceable for all counterparties in theevent of default, insolvency or bankruptcy. As
the Group's arrangements may not Fulﬁl the strictoffsetting criteria as required by IFRS, the Groupdoes not offset the respective amounts related
to these transactions on the balance sheet.Consequently, the remaining credit risk on securitieslending and borrowing as well as on repurchase
and reverse repurchase transactions is lully mitigated.
174
Securities transactions: As the Group does not applynetting on its balance sheet, the cash collateralprovided in securities borrowing and reverserepurchase transactions in the amount of
CHF 59.3 million (2016: CHF 17.6 million) andthe cash collateral received in securities lendingand repurchase transactions in the amount ofCHF 1,194.5 million (2016: CHF 1,549.5 million)as disclosed in Note 23 are not offset with therespective counterparty positions in the balancesheet
Derivative financial instruments: The derivativefinancial instruments consist of over-the—counter aswell as exchange-traded derivatives The majorityof over-the-Counter derivatives in the total amountofCHF1,458,1 million (positive replacement values)and CHF1,285.6 million (negative replacementvalues) are subject to an enforceable nettingagreement. Transactions with other banks aregenerally collateralised with other financialinstruments (derivatives) which are recognised
on the Group’s balance sheet. With non-bankingcounterparties, the collateral recognised is generallycash balances. None of these balances related tothe derivatives transactions are offset on the balancesheet. Additionally, there are derivative financialinstruments in the amountofCHF1,618.6 million(2016: CHF 664.3 million) which could be offsetwith the corresponding outstanding amount.
Refer to the Credit Risk section for further analysisof the Group’s credit risk strategies and exposure.

28 SHAREeBASED PAYMENTS AND OTHER COMPENSATION PLANS
The programmes described below reflect the planlandscape as at 31 December 2017. All plans arereviewed annually to reflect any regulatory changesand/or market conditions. The Group’s overallcompensation landscape is described in the chapterRemuneration Report of this Annual Report.
The Group hedges its liabilities from share-basedpayments by purchasing the shares on the marketon grant date through the LOTECO Foundation.Until vesting, the granted shares and pertormanceunits are administered by the foundation.
Deferred variable compensation plans
Cash-based variable compensation —
Deferred Cash Plan
The Deferred Cash Plan (DCP) promotes soundbusiness activities by remaining subject to forteiturewhile providing an inherently less volatile payoutthan shares. The DCP grant is made once a year aspart of the annual variable compensation awardedto the individual concerned, and participation isdetermined on an annual basis. These deterred
cash awards vest in equal one-third tranches,subject to continued employment, and accrued overa three-year plan period. Where share-based plansare not permissible under local legislation, employeeannual awards are fully deferred through the DCP.
Equity-based variable compensation —
Premium Share Plan
The Premium Share Plan (PSP) is designed to link
a portion of the employee’s variable compensationto the Iong-term success of the Group through itsshare price. A PSP grant is made once a year as partof the annual variable compensation awarded to theindividual concerned, and participation is determinedon an annual basis. The employee is granted anumber of shares equal in value to the deterredelement. These shares vest in equal oneethirdtranches over a three-year plan period. At the endof the plan period, subject to continued employment,the employee then receives an additional shareaward representing a further one third of thenumber of shares granted to him or her at thebeginning of the plan period.
i86
Equityebased variable compensation 7
Equity Performance P/an
The Equity Performance Plan (EPP) is a key part ofthe Julius Baer compensation model. One oftheCompensation Committee’s objectives was to createa robust long»term incentive mechanism for keyemployees. The EPP is an equity plan which seeksto create a retention element for key employeesand to link a significant portion ofthe executivecompensation to the future performance of theGroup.
Eligibility for the EPP is based on various factors,which include nomination by the CEO, overall rolewithin Julius Baer, total variable compensation and,as a new factor, individual contribution in
the reporting period (as part ofthe adjustment tothe performance alignment approach for thisperformance year’s EPP awards). All members ofthe Executive Board, key employees and employeesdefined as risk takers by virtue oftheir functionwithin the organisation are considered for the EPPbased on their specific roles The size ofthe grantawarded to each individual varies based on factorswhich include, but are not limited to, seniority,current as well as projected future contributions tothe Group, defined total pay mix and level ofresponsibility.
The EPP is an annual rolling equity grant (made inFebruary each year) that awards Performance
Units to eligible participants subject to individualperformance in the reporting period and Futurepertormance-based requirements. The EPP awardreflects the value of the individual for the currentand future success of the business and more closelylinks an individual’s compensation to his or hercontribution to the future performance ofthe Group.
The goal ofthe EPP is to incentivise participants intwo ways:
— Firstly, by the nature of its construction, theultimate value of the award to the participantsfluctuates with the market value of
Julius Baer Group Ltd, shares.
===================================================
188.hocr: 
FINANCTAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
a Secondly, the Performance Units are contingenton continued service and two key performanceindicators (KPls), cumulative Economic Profit(CEP) and relative Total Shareholder Return(rTSR). The service condition requires that theparticipant remains with the Group for threeyears after the grant (through a cliff-vestingmechanism). The performance of the two KPlsdetermines the number of shares the participantultimately receives.
The number of shares delivered under the EPP isbetween 0% and 150% of the number of PerformanceUnits granted in any given year (with each individualKPI being capped at a maximum multiplying factorof 200%). The cap serves to limit EPP awards so
as to avoid any unforeseen outcome of the final EPPmultiplier resulting in unintentionally high or excessivelevels of compensation. A high level of performanceis required to attain a maximum share delivery(creating a maximum uplift 0t 50% otthePerformance Units granted), with lowilevelperformance leading to potential nil compensation.
The KPI targets are set based on the strategicthree-year budget/plan that is approved by theBoard of Directors on an annual basis. Extremelyhigh (and, thus, unrealistic) performance targetsare avoided, so as not to incentivise excessive risktaking by executives and other managerial staff.
Integration Incentive Award (for former Bank ofAmerica Merrill Lynch relationship managers)
As part of Julius Baer’s integration at Bank of AmericaMerrill Lynch’s IWM business, key relationshipmanagers from IWM were offered participation inthe Integration Incentive Award (a cash, andshareibased plan) which was designed to incentiyiseindividuals tojoin the Group and move clients andassets to the Group. In 2015, new grants under theIntegration Incentive Award were solely awarded
in conjunction with the final transfer at the businessin India,
The Integration Incentive Award plan runs for amaximum of five years, with cash being paid out
on a rolling siX-month basis over the first three yearsand shares being delivered to participants on
the fourth and fifth anniversaries ofthe grant date.At the end of the plan period, subject to continued
187
employment, the employee receives an additionalshare award representing one third ofthe numberof shares granted to him or her at the beginning ofthe plan period.
In the event of termination of employment beforethe end of the plan period for any other reasonthan death, disability or retirement, unvested cashand/or shares are forfeited.
Incentive Share Plan (ISP, applied as part of thevariable compensation for 2072)
At the start of the plan period, 15% to 40% (themaximum deferral percentage applies to variablecompensation of CHF1 million and above or thelocal currency equivalent) of the executives’ variableincentive is deferred to the ISP and the employee
is then granted a number of shares equal in value tothe deferred element. These shares vest in equaloneethird trenches over the threeeyear plan period,subject to continued employment.
Participants in the ISP 2012 are granted a preetixednumber of incentive shares, which cliffivest at
the end of the three-year plan period, subject tocontinued employment. The number of incentiveshares granted is determined based on the numberof shares from bonus deferral: members of theExecutive Board were eligible for twice the numberof additional shares in comparison to participantswho are not members otthe Executive Board.
Until vested, the shares are subject to forfeiture
in certain circumstances including resignation
by the employee, termination for cause, substantialbreaches of legal or regulatory requirements,financial losses and a variety of other events wherethe employee’s behaviour has substantially con,tributed to a financial loss otthe Group or causedreputational damage.
LongiTerm Incentive P/an (LT!)
In certain specific situations the Group may alsooffer incentives outside the annual compensationcycle Compensatory payments to new hires fordeferred awards they have forfeited by resigningfrom their previous employer or retention paymentsto key employees during extraordinary or criticalcircumstances may be made by granting individualsan equity-based LTI.
===================================================
189.hocr: 
FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
An LT| granted in these circumstances generallyruns over a threeeyear plan period. The Groupcurrently operates two different vesting schedulesfor this plan: (1) three equal oneethird tranchesvesting over a threeeyear period, (2) cliftevesting ofall granted shares in one single tranche at the endof a three—year period.
The shares are transferred to participants at thetime of vesting, subject to continued employmentand any other conditions set out in the plan rules.
In the event of termination of employment beforethe end of the plan period for any other reasonthan death, disability or retirement, unvested sharesare Forfeited
StaffParticipation Plan (SPP)
The SPP is offered to most of the Group’s globalemployee population. Some individuals oremployees in specific locations are excluded from
188
participating because, for example, the employeesconcerned are participants in another Groupequityebased plan or because the SPP cannot
be offered in a particularjurisdiction for legalor regulatory reasons. Under this plan, eligibleparticipants may voluntarily purchase Julius BaerGroup Ltd. shares at the prevailing market priceand for every three shares so purchased they willreceive one additional share free of charge.These free shares vest after three years, subjectto continued employment. Purchases under theSPP only occur once a year.
The objective ofthis plan is to strengthen theemployee’s identification with the Group, toencourage entrepreneurial spirit, to generate greaterinterest in the business through ownership, and
to provide employees with financial recognition fortheir longeterm dedication to the Group.

30 REQUIREMENTS OF SWISS BANKING LAW
The Group is subject to supervision by the Swiss:inancial Market Supervisory Authority (FlNMA),which requires Switzerlandedomiciled banks usingnternational Financial Reporting Standards (lFRS)as their primary accounting standard to provide
a narrative explanation of the major differencesJetween IFRS and Swiss GAAP. Swiss GAAP
is based on the regulations of the Swiss Code ofObligation, on Swiss Banking Law and theOrdinance thereto, and on the guidelines of theZINMA Circular 2015/1 ‘Accounting Banks’.
The Following main differences exist betweenFRS and Swiss GAAP (true and fair view) whichare relevant to the Group:

Jncler IFRS, changes in the fair value of financialinvestments availableeforesale are directly recognisedin equity. Under Swiss GAAP, such investments
are recorded at the lower of cost or market, withchanges in value where required recorded in theincome statement.
Under IFRS, all income and expenses are attributedto ordinary business operations. Under Swiss GAAP,income and expenses are classified as extraordinary,if they are from noneoperating transactions and arenon»recurring.
Under IFRS, goodwill is not amortised but tested forimpairment annually and a write—oiic is made if therecoverable amount is less than the carrying amount.Under Swiss GAAP, goodwill is amortised over itsuseful life, generally not exceeding Five years (injustified cases up to twenty years), and tested forimpairment.
Swiss GAAP allows the application of IAS 19 for theaccounting For defined benefit plans. However, theremeasurement ofthe net defined benefit liability isrecognised in the income statement and comprisesmovements in actuarial gains and losses and returnon plan assets (excluding net interest cost). UnderIFRS, these components are recognised directly
in equity.

The Board of Directors consists 0t five or moremembers. lt meets as often as business requires, butat least once per quarter. The presence of a majorityof its members is necessary for resolutions to bepassed, with the exception of the ascertainmentresolution and the resolution concerning the amend-ment of the Articles of Incorporation as well as thecapital increase report in the case 0t capital increases.Resolutions are passed by an absolute majority ofvotes of members present. The members of theBoard of Directors may also be present by phone orelectronic means. Resolutions tor urgent or routinebusinesses of the Board of Directors may also bepassed by way of written consent (letter, tax) or byway of an electronic data transter provided that nomember requests oral deliberation. ln such cases,the text ofwritten resolutions must be sent to allmembers and approved by all members of the Boardof Directors to be valid.
In the case of a tie vote at meetings, the Chairmanshall have the casting vote. For resolutions passedby the Board of Directors with regard to agendaitems that have been subject to prior resolution by aCommittee of the Board of Directors (pre-resolvingCommittee) and itthe members of such pre-resolvingCommittee (taking into consideration the castingvote of the Chairman) would represent a majority ofvotes in the Board of Directors, the casting vote shallnot be with the Chairman of the Board but with theChairperson of the Audit Committee, unless the
i9
Chairperson of the Audit Committee is also amember of such prearesolving Committee, in whichcase the casting vote shall be with the member otthe Board of Directors who is not a member of suchpreeresolving Committee and who has served thelongest total term of office on the Board 01‘ Directors.The CEO and CFO are standing guests in themeetings otthe complete Board of Directors whilethe other members of the Executive Board of JuliusBaer Group Ltd. are invited to participate as guestsfor those topics that are within their businessresponsibility as well as for specific reporting sessions.These meetings generally take up at least half a clay.
In order to gauge the effectiveness of its activities,the Board of Directors as a whole as well as therespective committees carry out an annual self—assessment. The aim is to review and assess whathas been achieved relative to the objectives tormUelated at the beginning of the year. The results ofthe committees are brought to the attention ofthecomplete Board of Directors.
The Board of Directors normally meets for onestrategy seminar a year. The purpose of this seminaris to analyse the positioning of the Julius Baer Groupas well as to review and if necessary redefine itsstrategic direction in light of the prevailing macro-economic and company-specific circumstances.

DEFINITION OF AREAS OFRESPONSIBILITY
Julius Baer’s strategic framework for long—termvalue creation
Since the establishment of the new Julius Baer Groupin 2009, the company has consistently executed thelong»term strategy outlined at the time, with the aimto create long-term sustainable value for clients andinvestors. At its core is the Focus on pure privatebanking and on realising proﬁtable organic andinorganic growth by leveraging the Group’s regionalstrengths and client-centric service model.
Applying a client—centric business model
Julius Baerfocuses on pure private banking,targeting private clients and family ofﬁces as well
as external asset managers. The Group’s uniqueposition of strength as the leading Swiss privatebanking group is further reinforced by an unmatchedfocus on clientecentric (as opposed to producteled)service excellence, supported by Julius Baer‘s openproduct platform, all of which are driven by acommitted management team with deep experiencein private banking.
Generating sustainable growth by leveraging JuliusBeer’s regional strengths and c/ient-centric servicemodel
Since 2009, Julius Baer’s strategy has aimed atdelivering profitable growth both organically as wellas inorganically through acquisitions.
Organic growth is achieved by generating steadynet new money throughout the business cyclethrough the onboarding of new clients, increasingthe share of wallet with existing clients as well ascarefully hiring experienced relationship managers.In this process, the Group’s pure private bankingfocus, its distinctive corporate culture, itsconservatively managed balance sheet and itscomparatively lowwisk business profile are all keyelements strengthening Julius Baer's attractivenessas the employer of choice for top private bankersand the bank of choice for its clients. Throughselective acquisitions to support the Group’s growthstrategy, Julius Baer aims to preserve these keyadvantages,
Julius Baer’s strategy is supported by a diversifiedglobal footprint, ensuring overall profitable andsustainable growth and making it possible to neutraliseslower economic development in any one region.
In the geographic allocation of its investments ingrowth, the Group has always aimed to strike anequilibrium over the cycle between investments intoJulius Baer’s original target markets of Switzerlandand Europe (approximately 50% of assets undermanagement) and into its presence in the key wealthmanagement growth markets around the world —Asia, Latin America, the Middle East, Israel andAfrica, as well as Central and Eastern Europe,including Russia (approximately 50% of assetsunder management)
Calibrating the strategy in a changing environment
In 2017, as in other years,Ju|ius Baer’s Board ofDirectors extensively reviewed the Group’s long,term strategy with the Group’s management, both interms of its ongoing standealone validity and againstpotential alternative strategies. The two bodiesjointly concluded that, while the factors such as clientneeds, market conditions, regulatory requirementsand the competitive landscape will be in permanentflux, the core elements of the Group’s long-termstrategy as outlined in 2009 remain valid.
To lay the foundation for continued success, over thenext Few years the Group's strategy will focusparticularly on delivering a best-in-class wealthmanagement experience for clients, on strengtheningthe Group’s position as employer of choice for topprivate banking professionals and as bank of choicefor its clients, and on continuing to be among themost profitable businesses in the sector. This is to beachieved by concentrating on the followingelements:
Enhancing the Group’s market focus andregionalisation while realigning the organisationto the evolving marketespeciﬁc client needs.Strengthening the client-facing managementstructure and the client knowledge framework,encompassing all existing and anticipated futureregulatory requirements.

7 Increasing the productivity and efficiencythrough investing in the Group’s technologyplatform and processes and strengthening theemphasis on its target clients.
— Further establishing Julius Baer as the globalleader in private banking and building on theGroup’s attractive employee value proposition.
Whereas in 2016 the Group had been able tocapitalise on substantial opportunities to hirerelationship managers (RM), in 2017 the focus wasshifted towards a more normalised hiring pace andon improving the quality and Capacity of theclientifacing private bankers. In 2017 the Groupfurther introduced a new framework For its frontoffice organisation, with dedicated market and teamleadership roles. This move is designed to free upRM capacity to focus on client servicing. At thesame time, the model enables front office teams towork more effectively in pursuing businessdevelopment opportunities, managing key clients,developing talents and addressing increasedregulatory complexity.
Creating shareho/der value
Key elements of Julius Baer’s strategic focus arereflected in its financial targets and driven by its aimto balance growth and profitability:
Growth: Julius Baer’s focus on organic growth isreflected in the Group’s mediumeterm target torealise between 4% and 6% net new moneyexpansion per annum.
Profitable growth: Julius Baer’s focus onachieving profitable growth is echoed by its dualtargets of realising an adjusted1 cost/incomeratio2 of between 64% and 68% and an adjustedpretax margin3 of over 30 basis points in themedium term.
Strong balance sheet, comparatively Iow-riskbusiness profile: The focus on maintaining thesetwo key competitive advantages partly manifestsitself in Julius Baer’s aim to maintain its BIS totalcapital ratio above 15% and its BIS core equitytier1 ratio above 11%, three percentage pointsabove the regulatory required minimum levels. Insetting its floors at these levels, the Groupbelieves it achieves an appropriate balancebetween on the one hand maintaining a solidcapital buffer and on the other hand continuingto generate attractive returns for its shareholders.Shareholder value: The continued successfulexecution of the longiterm strategy is expectedto result in a prolonged above-market return toshareholders This aim is further supported bythe Group’s intent to grow its dividend pay-outratio to approximately 40% of adjusted netprofits
Pay for performance: The Group’s focus onsustainable profitable growth and Iong-termshareholder value creation is reflected in theExecutive Board’s compensation structure, inparticular via the cumulative economic profit andrelative total shareholder return components atthe equity performance plan.

FOREWORD
DEAR READER
2017 proved to be a successful year for Julius Baer. Supported by an overallfavourable financial market environment, the operating performance ofour Group showed clear improvement on all levels as we reaped the fruits oflast year’s strategic hiring initiative and organisational changes. Thesedevelopments as well as the prestigious award as the Wor/d’s Best Bank forWealth Management we received from Euromoney last summer are furthervalidations of our Iong—term strategy. Building on our strong businessmomentum, we pushed ahead with the implementation of our strategicroadmap designed to keep our company fighting-ﬁt for the future.
The ﬁnancial strength of our Group is a reflection of our clients’ trust in
our ability to act as their advisors. The net profit for 2017 increased strongly,and net new money growth exceeded our medium-term target range of4—6%. At the end of December 2017, the Group’s total capital ratio stood at220% (fully applied 21.2%) and the BIS CET1 capital ratio was at 16.7%(fully applied13.5%). Both ca Dital ratios are well above the Group’s own floors0f15% and 11%, and significantly above the regulatory minimums of 12.2%and 8%. The strengthening ofthe total capital ratio was partly attributableto the successful placement of USD 300 million of perpetual non—cumulativehigh—trigger Additional Tier (AT1) securities in September 2017, whichgenerated the biggest subscription level of any European issue in 2017. Inlight of the excellent financial results, the Board of Directors intends to proposeto the Annual General Meeting on 11 April 2018 an increased dividendofCHF1.4O per share. The otal proposed dividend payout amounts toCHF 313 million, up from CT- F 269 million in 2017.
Under the leadership of CEO Bernhard Hodler, appointed in November 2017,our management team will further sharpen our strategic focus on pureprivate banking and exploit tie opportunities for proﬁtable growth in ourchosen markets. Our global franchise is well balanced across geographiesand enables us to benefit from wealth creation in established and growthmarkets alike. At the same time, our industry is evolving at a fast pace.

Changes in regulation and client needs redefine every aspect of our business,from the way we advise our clients to the products and services we offer
and the job profiles ofour employees. With digitalisation sweeping throughvirtually every aspect of modern life, technology becomes an increasinglyimportant aspect of any value proposition. Continued development is key,and we are fortunate to be able to harness these trends from a position ofstrength. We continue to invest in our core banking platforms, the scalabilityof processes, our investment solutions capabilities and digital tools. Theoverarching objective is to provide our clients with holistic wealth managementservices that cover every stage of their individual lives. We call our approach

MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR 2017
LETTER TO OUR SHAREHOLDERS
Dear Shareholders,
Last year’s changes to the frontfacing organisation were aimed at enhancinghe Julius Baer Group's geographical and client focus. In 2017, the employmentof sound, market-speciﬁc strategies capitalised on this reshaped regionalramework, which was further supported by the creation of dedicated marketand team leadership roles Alongside the roll—out of new advisory servicemodels, assets under management grew by 16% (an increase ofCHF 52 billion)0 CHF 388 billion, amplified by CHF 22 billion in net new money. Thanks toits strong market position, Julius Baer was able to increase its operatingincome by 14% to CHF 3,252 million and its adjusted net proﬁt‘ for the Group3y 14% to CHF 806 million.
As announced at the end of November, Bernhard HodIer was appointed ashe new CEO of the Group. Under his leadership, Julius Baer wiII continueits successful strategy of growth and further sharpen its focus on pureorivate banking. We sincerely thank Boris FIJI COIIarcIi for his excellentstewardship of the Group and wish him well for the future.

Our success at recruiting and retaining industry taIent is firmly rooted inour overall employee value proposition. In recognition of the key drivingfactors, we continued to implement new programmes focused on leadershipand talent development. In 2017, Julius Beer launched the ‘Coach Approachto Leadership’ programme, developed to sharpen the existing leadershipcompetencies of our senior management so that they become highly effectivecoaches to our relationship managers and key specialists. Furthermore,
as an important means of fostering employee engagement, we significantlybroadened our mentoring programme offerings which focused on highlymotivated female talents and young talents.
In 2017, we introduced a number of enhancements to the qualitativeassessment processes for our front office organisation. They are aIigned withour ‘tirst—Iine—of defence’ principles, better capturing the Fulfilment of ‘know—your—client’ standards and compliance with the newa implemented end—to—endadvisory processes For the European Advisory locations, consistent with thenew ‘Markets in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID II)’. For the newly createddedicated management roles in the front ofﬁce, we have further stepped upthe qualitative appraisal of how they carry out their leadership roles, particularlytheir accou ntabiIity for their teams’ fulfilment of reguIatory requirements.

MAIN DEVELOPMENTS IN THE YEAR 2017
We strongly believe our compensation framework remains consistent with thepromotion of value creation for all stakeholders and supports our overall businessstrategy in a responsible way. For that reason, no material changes were made tothis framework in 2017. Our compensation structures, incorporating significantlevels of deferred compensation, long—term performance periods and balancedmixes of cash and equity awards, encompass best practices as defined
by regulators, peers and our own compensation strategy‘ As part of ourgovernance oversight, a detailed benchmarking of the compensation of
the Board of Directors, the Executive Board and our key employees was againconducted in 2017. We continued to review and implement minor changes
to our compensation policy to ensure continued compliance with local regulationsin our operating locations.
While we purposefully chose to maintain a stable executive compensationstructure, adjustments to the performance alignment approach used forour Equity Performance Plan (EPP) have triggered reporting changes, whichare reflected in this Remuneration Report. The EPP awards to be granted
in 2018 for the performance year under review (2017) are now reportedas variable compensation For the performance year (2017). Formerly,these awards would have been reported as variable compensation for thefollowing grant year (2018) We would like to state explicitly that theunderlying EPP award cycle has stayed the same and that no additionalgrants have been made Similarly, no modifications have been made to
the binding say—on—pay votes (as defined in article11.1 of our Articles ofIncorporation) Finally, this reporting adjustment does not impact theinformation that the Group will provide to shareholders for the purposesof the vote on this year’s Remuneration Report.
We appreciate the confidence that our shareholders have consistentlydemonstrated in our compensation framework In line with the ‘Swiss Ordinanceagainst Excessive Compensation in Listed Companies’, shareholders will beasked to vote on the identified, detailed compensation arrangements forthe Board of Directors and Executive Board disclosed in this RemunerationReport. In addition, mirroring the importance we place on engaging
with our shareholders on compensation matters, a consultative vote on theRemuneration Report will again be conducted.
On behahc 0f the Board of Directors,

COMPENSATION COMMITTEEAUTHORITY AND RESPONSIBILITIES
Julius Baer operates a multietiered system ofcompensation governance which ensures
that there are clear processes governing all aspectsof compensation. The Board of Directors setsthe overall remuneration policy and retains

PEER BENCHMARKING
It is important to the Compensation Committee andthe Board of Directors that the Group ensures thatits compensation practices, structure and pay levels
(adjusted for performance) remain competitivewithin the marketplace and are consistent withthose of its peers from year to year.
The Compensation Committee continues toconsider the SMl as the most relevant peer groupfor the purposes of compensation comparison.However, it also looks at industry peers as part ofits assessment of corporate governance practicesand relative performance reviews. Taking intoaccount the Group's market capitalisation and thecomplexity of the industry in which it operates,
the Group’s current positioning between the lowerquartile and median ofSMl companies remainsappropriate This peer group positioning continuesto be reviewed annually.

SAYVONVPAY
In accordance with the Swiss Ordinance againstExcessive Compensation in Listed Companies(Ordinance), Julius Baer Group reports thecompensation awarded to members 07‘ both theBoard of Directors and the Executive Board on abusiness year basis. While the fixed compensationfor the Board of Directors and the Executive Boardis approved on a prospective basis For operationalpurposes, shareholders vote on the actual variablecompensation amounts awarded to the ExecutiveBoard The Board of Directors recognises that thebinding say-on—pay vote is not only a meaningfultool For shareholders, but also one that requiresanalysis and proper context to enable shareholdersto interpret the compensation numbers on whichthey vote This Remuneration Report aims to assistshareholders in this responsibility.
The approval of compensation by the AGM is
defined in article 11.1 of the Articles of Incorporation.
This approval determines:
1. the maximum aggregate amount of compensationpaid to the Board of Directors for its next term
of office;
the maximum aggregate amount of fixedcompensation ofthe Executive Board For thefinancial year fol owing the respective GeneralMeeting of Shareholders;
the aggregate amount of variable cash—basedcompensation e ements of the Executive Boardfor the financial year preceding the respectiveGeneral Meeting of Shareholders; and
the aggregate amount of variable equity-basedcompensation e ements of the Executive Boardgranted in the current Financial year.

In addition, a consultative vote on the RemunerationReport is again scheculed Forthe AGM on 11 April 2018.
The Board of Directors is committed to maintaining
a dialogue with share
'iolders on compensation matters.
The detailed compensation data will be provided
to shareholders as Dart of their invitations to theAGM.

Financial performance assessment
The baseline for calculating the Group’s variablecompensation pool is the annual adjusted netoperating profit before variable compensation andtaxes (‘adjusted NOPbBT') generated by theGroup (as reconciled by the Audit Committee). TheGroup’s adjusted NOPbBT is derived by excludingfrom the audited IFRS ﬁnancial statements itemssuch as integration and restructuring expenses andamortisation of intangible assets related toacquisitions or divestments.
Adjusted NOPbBT has been selected as theappropriate baseline for the variable compensationpool funding as it is the underlying, sustainableoperating profit generated by the business. It is animportant metric which reﬂects the Group's
actual performance, thus giving the CompensationCommittee a clear indication of operatingperformance and providing a reliable baseline torcomparing the year-on-year development of
the Group,
In determining the pool, the CompensationCommittee also takes other ﬁnancial metrics intoconsideration such as changes in and/or thedevelopment otthe capital ratios, cost/income ratio,gross/net profit margin, economic profit and net
46
new money generation All quantitative metrics aremeasured against the overall midterm plan, thestrategic goals of the Group and its historical resultsfor the prior three years.
Qualitative performance assessment
The qualitative review of performance is multi-faceted in order for the Compensation Committeeto gain a perspective on the sustainability of thefinancial results and quality of earnings. Firstly, theGroup's performance is measured in terms of
how successfully key aspects, affecting current andfuture performance, have been managed withregard to regulatory compliance, control frameworkeffectiveness and risk Secondly, the financialresults are further assessed against the performanceof peers and market trends, which guide thedetermination of the relative value contribution.Finally, the progression and outcomes of key strategicinitiatives pertaining to corporate developmentand transactions (merger and acquisition activity)are also appraised.
Overall review
The Compensation Committee carries out a reviewof the size of the proposed variable compensationpool taking into account the overall performance aswell as factors such as long-term sustainable value

creation, affordability and market positioning aspart of a governance appraisal. The CompensationCommittee recommends adjustments only inexceptional cases and does not make adjustmentsto the pool in subsequent years to take intoaccount reduced or revoked variable compensationdue to ex—ante or ex-post performance adjustmentsmade in prior years. This additional governanceprocess further helps the Compensation Committeeto maintain a balance between the development
of the pool and the Group’s corporate performance,
As part ofthe approval of the final variablecompensation pool, the Board of Directors seeksto ensure that the profit distribution amongststakeholders (principally through shareholderdividends, global taxes paid to the relevantauthorities, employee variable compensation andreinvestment into the business) is sustainable
and reflects an appropriate, equitable distribution.
This variable compensation pool is allocatedacross the various business units based on suchfactors as headcount, ﬁnancial performance,significant achievements and contributions to theadjusted NOPbBT. This policy has beenconsistently employed over many years and thusallows meaningful year-on-year comparisons
and the continued implementation of a stablecompensation system.
2017JUL|US BAER GROUP PERFORMANCE
The Group successfully pushed ahead with theimplementation of its strategic roadmap and
built on the underlying key initiatives which wereput in place to position the Group for future growthand profitability. These initiatives centred on enhancingmarket focus and regionalisation, providing clientswith holistic wealth management services throughouttheir life stages as well as increasing productivity
and flexibility through improved processes andtechnical advances.
In 2017, the benefits of last year's strategic hiringinitiative and organisational changes wereobservable across the Group’s chosen markets.
Strong net inflows resulted in an accelerated netnew money growth of 6.6%, exceeding the Group’smediumeterm target range of 476%.
In this year’s favourable market environment, theGroup was able to capitalise on profitablegrowth opportunities. The Group increased itsadjusted net profit to a record CHF 806 million,representing a 14% year-on—year increase. WhenKairos’ fair value adjustment and the Swiss pensionplan amendment are excluded from the 2016operating income and expenses, the year-on-yearincrease in the adjusted net profit for the Grouprises to 30%.
While operating income grew by 14% to
CH F 3,252 million, increases in income from asset-based fees, net interest earnings and dividends as wellas higher client transaction commissions were partlyoffset by lower net trading income and changes in otherordinary results. This led to a gross margin of 89.7 basispoints (bp) compared to 91.1 bp in 2016. As a result, theGroup’s adjusted cost/income ratio‘ was 69.0%compared to 68.9% in 2016. When the Kail’OS* andpension fund-related items are excluded from the 2016operating income and expenses, the comparableadjusted cost/income ratio is 72.0% for 2016 and theyear»on»year improvement equates to three percentagepoints for 2017. The adjusted cost/income ratio isexpected to move inside the midterm target range in2018.
The IFRS results in the Group's 2017 consolidatedfinancial statements confirm that the net profitgrew by 15% to CHF 716 million. After consideringnon-Controlling interests of CHF 11 million,
the IFRS net profit attributable to shareholders ofJulius Baer Group Ltd. increased by 14% to
CHF 705 million with earnings per share increasingfrom CHF 2.85 to CHF 3.25.
At the end of 2017, on a phaseein basis, the Groupmaintained a BIS total capital ratio of 22.0%
and a BIS CET1capita|ratio of16.7%, both well inexcess of the Group’s Floors (15.0% and 11.0%,respectively) and the regulatory minimumrequirements (122% and 8.0%, respectively).

Although Julius Baer’s variable compensationscheme is discretionary, the final amounts allocatedto its individual participants are based on acareful assessment of each individual’s attainmentof a mix of specific quantitative and qualitativeobjectives These objectives are individuallyweighted to support the alignment of managerialactions with shareholder interests as part of abalanced scorecard
Objective setting for the CEO
Each year the Chairman of the Board meets
with the CEO to discuss and determine the keyperformance objectives for the upcomingperformance yeart The objectives are defined in aCEO scorecard (see the 2017 scorecard below
in the ‘Pen‘ormance assessment based on scorecard’section of this Remuneration Report) with clearindividual goals and targets for each of therespective valueedriver categories. In a typical year,the CEO will have performance objectives in
the four valueedriver categories (each of which willtypically contain several goals).
When formulating the CEO's objectives, theChairman of the Board, in collaboration with theChairperson of the Compensation Committee, aimsto ensure that the defined goals are aligned with theoverall midterm plan and strategic goals of
Julius Beer. In addition, they endeavour to weight thegoals properly in order to promote sustainableperformance in a conservative manner, whilst alsoensuring risk management and regulatorycompliance. Qualitative objectives are defined
to support the attainment of individual goals
which, whilst not readily expressible in quantitativeterms, nonetheless contribute to the overall
success oFJulius Beer.
===================================================

REMUNERATION REPORTEXECUTIVE BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT COM PENSATION
Once agreed and defined, the Chairman of theBoard and the Chairperson of the CompensationCommittee approve the final objectives in theirentirety, It is important to note that the baseline forthe various objectives contained in the CEO’sscorecard (e.g. the threeiyear midterm plan orbudget, quantitative Group level goals, etc.) isapproved by the Board of Directors.
Objective setting for the Executive Board membersThe objective-setting process for the ExecutiveBoard members mirrors that of the CEO; however,it is the CEO who meets with each member atthe Executive Board to discuss and determine thekey performance objectives for the upcomingperformance year.
The CEO’s approved scorecard serves as thebaseline for the individual Executive Board member'sscorecards Executive Board members are alsogiven performance objectives in all four otthevalueedriver categories listed on the scorecard
below (each of which will typically contain several
52
goals). As each Executive Board member acts
in a different capacity within the Group, theobjectives for each valueedriver category (and thecorresponding goals within each category) areindividually geared towards each Executive Boardmember's area of responsibility. The CEOapproves the final objectives in their entirety.
Performance assessment based on scorecard
These key performance objectives are formallymeasured at year»end, when the scorecard isdiscussed between the Chairman of the Boardand the CEO (in the case of the CEO’s goals)
and between the CEO and the respective ExecutiveBoard member (in all other cases). However,performance against value drivers and individualgoals is continuously monitored. The outcomes
of these assessments are reviewed in detail by
the Compensation Committee, on behalf of the Boardof Directors, as the basis for all DBP award
recommendations for the Executive Board (includingthe CEO) submitted to the Board of Directors.

For competitive confidentiality reasons, thespecific quantitative objectives for each of the abovecomponents are not disclosed.
In the assessment process, the actual achievementof quantitative objectives is measured against theobjectives set in the individual's scorecard todetermine his or her relative achievement. Forqualitative objectives, actual performance is measureddirectly by the Chairman of the Board in the case ofthe CEO and by the CEO in the case of all other
members of the Executive Board. However, in thecase of qualitative measurements, the measuringparty may need to rely upon other Julius Baeremployees, external advisers, and/or members of theBoard of Directors to complete the measurement. Forexample, in the determination of the level oftheindividuals performance relative to regulatorycompliance, consultation with the Group's Head ofCompliance may be required to complete the finalassessment.
For each of the individual goals, each Executive Board member’s actual achievement is determinedin percentage terms based on the Following rating system:





Rating Description Performance objective achievementA++ significantly exceeds goal >133%
A+ exceeds goal 1117133%
A fully meets goal 9'l7110%
B goal achievement below expectation 67—90%

Once the individual performance goals (withineach value driver) are properly assessed, aweighted average of all performance objectives iscalculated to determine the individual’s overallperformance within the applicable value driver. Afinal average weighting of all fourvalue drivers iscalculated based on the value—driver weighting todetermine the preliminary performance ratingbased on the individual’s assessed performance.
Once the Executive Board member’s preliminaryperformance rating has been calculated, a verificationis performed. This verification is completed by theChairman of the Board and the Chairperson of theCompensation Committee in the case at the CEO’sperformance and by the CEO for all other members ofthe Executive Board. The purpose ofthis verificationstep is to ensure that the preliminary performancerating of the participant makes fundamental sense(for example to ensure that strong qualitativeperformance does not skew the overall rating of anExecutive Board member in a year when overallquantitative corporate performance and shareholderreturn is negative), In this verification process, thepreliminary performance rating of the Executive Board

member may be adjusted marginally upwards ordownwards to determine the final performance rating.
The scorecard's results provide the basis fordetermining the recommended DBP allocation.These individual assessments mean that theoverall pay mix awarded to individual ExecutiveBoard members may differ From year to
year, due to individual, divisional and/or Groupperformance, as well as overall individualresponsibilities.
All DBP recommendations for the Executive Boardare subject to confirmation by the CompensationCommittee and, once approved, are then agreed uponin aggregate by the Board of Directors, withspecific acceptance of the proposed DBP award
to the CEO being requested from the Board
of Directors,
Final approval of the DBP for the financial yearfor the Executive Board will be sought From ourshareholders at the AGM following the end of thefinancial year.

2077 Executive Board performance
In the Group’s pursuit to deliver a besteineclass wealthmanagement experience, Julius Baer providedtimely and tailored advice to clients through a steadilygrowing number of digital channels and grewsustainable profit levels for shareholders.
As always, the Group's adjusted financial results are
a significant component of the scorecard assessmentof both the CEO and the other Executive Boardmembers. Thanks to balanced cost management in2017, the Group successfully managed higherexpenses stemming from investments in technologicaltransformation and higher staff levels. While
these strategic initiatives continued to weigh on theGroup's margins, the Group capitalised on theupturn in the global market environment and achievedstrong financial results (as described in thesection above entitled ‘2017Julius Baer Groupperformance’).
Julius Baer’s technological transformation was tackledby the Executive Board on multiple Fronts in 2017.The multiyear project to upgrade and globallyharmonise Julius Baer's core banking platforms is
in the final stage in Asia and major steps were takenin 2017 to establish Luxembourg as Julius Baer’sprimary European hub outside Switzerland. Thebooking platform in Luxembourg and the growingproduct offering it supports allow for an expanding
set of business opportunities in the region, TheGroup improved its clients’ digital service experiencethrough upgrades to the Julius Baer Mobile BankingApp and the launch of additional tunctionalitieswithin the Investment Insights App. Greater businessscalability and improvements in front—officeproductivity were also achieved through upgrades todigital platforms (and related processes), which werefocused on product distribution and wealth planningofferings as well as compliance matters. Furthermore,a new Integrated Advisory Platform was launched in2017 to support a MiFlDell compliant, endetOeendadvisory process for the European Advisory locations.

The Executive Board enhanced client proximitythrough the implementation of marketespecificstrategies and further development of integratedapproaches to provide tailored financial solutions.This included significant progress in the realignmentof the Investment Management organisation tomeet ever-evolving client needs, further developmentof the Group’s discretionary investment solutionsoffering, the successful launch of several newfunds managed by Kairos and the roll-out of thenew advisory service models (Advice Basic,
Advice Premium and Advice Advanced) by AdvisorySolutions to clients on the Luxembourg bookingplatform
The Executive Board remained instrumental inreinforcing Julius Baer’s client-centric excellence
and management culture and these achievementswere reflected in the external recognition bestowed
on the Group. Julius Baer received various
awards across the globe, including ‘World’s BestBank for Wealth Management’ by ‘Euromoney’,‘Best Boutique Private Bank in Asia’ by ‘The Asset’(a leading publication in the region) for the eighthconsecutive year, ‘Outstanding Private Bank —Switzerland — Domestic Playersy by ‘Private BankerInternationalY for the second consecutive year, ‘BestPrivate Banking Group 2017’ at the ‘UAE BusinessAwards 2017’ and ‘Outstanding Bank for GrowthStrategy — M&A’ at the ‘Private Banker InternationalGlobal Wealth Awards 2017’ as well as ‘Best EquityProduct‘ and ‘Best Product on Precious Metals/Foreign Currencies’ at the ‘Swiss Derivative Awards2017' and Kairos' receipt of ‘Best Overall AssetManagement Group’ by ‘Hedge Funds Review’ and‘Pan-European Hedge Fund 2017’ by 'Extel’.
Based on individual and corporate performance in2017, the Executive Board members (excluding thenew CEO) achieved an average performancerating oF‘A’ under Julius Baer’s assessment process.
As part of his former CRO role, the new CEOplayed a key role in the implementation of the strategicroadmap by driving the processes to raise riskawareness and accountability throughout the Groupas well as ensuring the Group’s alignment withregulatory standards. The new CEO’s efforts in definingthe architecture of Julius Baer's risk managementlandscape as well as his strong leadership throughout

the change in the management team were reflectedin his 2017 scorecard assessment. Based on the
above individual and corporate performance in 2017,the scorecard assessment for the new CEO
(mainly based on his former CRO role) completed bythe Chairman ofthe Board of Directors and reviewedwith the Compensation Committee resulted in a finalassessment of‘A’ under Julius Baer’s performancerating scheme.
In assessing and determining the compensation
of the new CEO and Executive Board members for2017, the Compensation Committee and Board
of Directors took all of the Group’s achievements in2017 into consideration. Due to his resignationprior to the year-end and the resulting bonusineligibility, no Final performance assessment wasconducted for the former CEO.
Plan structure ofthe DBP
The DBP aims to ensure that its participants continueto manage Julius Baer for sustainable longetermshareholder value creation, to emulate the Julius Baervalues, and to carry out all business activities in amanner which is compliant with regulatory requirements.As a result, the amounts allocated to each individual(through the individual’s scorecard) are closely tied tofactors that Julius Baer has identified as key valuedrivers for the Group.
The Full amount olthe DBP is generally awarded
in the first quarter following the close of the relevantfinancial (Le. calendar) year. For 2017, the DBP torthe Executive Board will be recommended in the firstquarter of 2018; however, it will not be paid until ithas been approved by our shareholders.
Although subject to deferral, the DBP is consideredas earned in the year the award is granted and,
as such, it is reported under the accrual principle inthe Remuneration Report for the pertormanceyear in which the award is earned. The DBP is paidin cash; however, where the granted DBPexceeds the minimum threshold (CHF 125,000, orits local currency equivalent) a portion is subjectto a five-year deferral. During those five years, thedeferred amount is paid out in five equal annual
. The investment offering is dependent on local rules and regulations.
56
instalments, For DBP amounts between theminimum threshold and CHF1 million (or its localcurrency equivalent), a sliding scale is applied,under which the deferral percentage increases linearlyfrom 20% to 50% (consistent with the previousyear), DBP amounts ofCHF1 million (or its
local currency equivalent) or higher will remainsubject to the maximum deferral rate of 50%.Amounts below the DBP minimum threshold arenot subject to deferral.
This deferral promotes a long-term orientation.
It allows Julius Baer to claw back DBP
amounts in the event ofa substantial breach
of legal or regulatory requirements, financial losses(e.g. misrepresentation of variables on which
the DBP award was based) and a variety of otherevents where the employee’s conduct hassubstantially contributed to a financial loss by theJulius Baer Group or has caused it reputationaldamage, The deferral element is not intended tofunction as a retention measure, since the executivesare entitled to continue to receive the deferredamounts (according to the payout schedule) evenafter termination of employment. It is nevertheless
an important element in the compensation package.
For DBP grants, the members ofthe ExecutiveBoard and Senior Management can elect to hold thedeferred cash awards (partially or fully) in Julius Baermutual funds, in particular the JB Strategy Income,Balanced or Growth funds.1 This plan adjustmentfurther aligns the interests 01: the Executive Boardwith those ofour major clients. All such investmentsand any potential proceeds remain subject to thesame clawback conditions.
Equity-based variable compensation
The Equity Performance Plan (EPP) is a key partof the Julius Beer compensation model. One of
the Compensation Committee’s objectives was tocreate a robust long~term incentive mechanismfor key employees, The EPP is an equity plan whichseeks to create a retention element for key employeesand to link a significant portion of the executivecompensation to the future performance of the Group.

The number of shares delivered under the EPP
is between 0% and 150% ofthe number ofPerformance Units granted in any given year (witheach individual KPl being capped at a maximummultiplying factor of200%). The cap serves to limitEPP awards so as to avoid any unforeseen outcome
of the final EPP multiplier resulting in unintentionallyhigh or excessive levels of compensation. A highlevel of performance is required to attain a maximumshare delivery (creating a maximum uplift of 50%
of the Performance Units granted), with low-levelperformance leading to potential nil compensation.
The KPI targets are set based on the strategicthree-year budget/plan that is approved by theBoard of Directors on an annual basis. Extremelyhigh (and, thus, unrealistic) performance targetsare avoided, so as not to incentivise excessive
risk taking by executives and other managerial staff.
Until allocation to the plan participants, all
Performance Units granted underthe EPP areadministered by the LOTECO Foundation.
Details ofkey performance indicators (KP/s)
KPI 1: cumulative Economic Profit (cEP). Julius Baerrewards Executive Board members for
creating economic value added, i.e. profitabilityfor shareholders over and above the cost ofcapital (COC). This idea is captured in economicprofit, which is calculated as:
cEP = NOPbB — T — CoCwhere
NOPbB = adjusted net operating profit beforevariable compensation (excluding amortisationof intangible assets as well as integration andrestructuring costs related to previous acquisitionsor divestments, as well as nonipertormanceirelated extraordinary events approved by theCompensation Committee)
T 2 taxes
CoC = cost of capital
All calculations will be based on the approved figuresconfirmed by the Audit Committee of Julius Baer.The calculation and all its components are reviewedand approved by the Compensation Committee.
58
Each year, the Compensation Committee approvesa cEP target range for the next three years. Anyperformance below the minimum in this range willbe deemed to constitute lowilevel performanceand will result in a multiplier of 0%; when the cEPachieved over the threeiyear performance period
is above this minimum, the multiplier increases linearly,up to a maximum multiplying factor of 200%.
For the EPP grant for 2017, the CompensationCommittee has chosen to maintain the same payoutparameters as applied in prior years:
Minimum: if the final cEP is 50% or less of thecEP target, the cEP multiplier will be 0%
Target: iFthe final cEP is equal to the cEP target,the cEP multiplier will be 100%
Maximum: if the final cEP exceeds the cEPtarget by 50% or more, the cEP multiplier willbe 200%
Julius Baer’s cEP target is entirely based on
the Group’s threeiyear midterm plan. As publishingthe actual cEP performance target is consideredmarketisensitive from a competitive viewpoint,Julius Baer has chosen not to disclose these figures.However, Julius Baer sets a challenging midtermplan which is approved by the Board of Directors,which is fully aware that this plan constitutes thebaseline for the cEP,
KPI 2: relative Total Shareholder Return (rTSR).Julius Baer wishes to ensure that the ExecutiveBoard and Senior Management (which includesselected regulated staff and/or nominatedemployees) is rewarded for outperforming itscompetitors in terms otthe value created torshareholders. Thus, while a positive economic profit(KPI 1) indicates that value was created, Julius Baeralso wishes to incentivise its management to
work on developing, executing and communicatingon strategic and operational objectives in such away that the expected and resulting economic profitperformance is deemed sustainable into the futureand will, as a result, translate into a relative share-price outperformance. Accordingly, rTSR has beenchosen as the second KPI, because it provides ameasure of the success of these efforts. To calculaterTSR, the Julius Baer Group’s TSR is comparedagainst the performance otthe STOXX Europe 600Banks gross return Index (the ‘lndex’).

REMUNERATION REPORTEXECUTIVE BOARD AND SENIOR MANAGEMENT COMPENSATION
Each year, the Compensation Committeeapproves the rTSR target range. Any performancebelow the minimum in that range will be deemed
to constitute lowilevel performance and will resultin a multiplier of 0%; when the rTSR achieved
over the threeeyear performance period is above thisminimum, the multiplier increases linearly up to amaximum multiplying factor of 200%. For the 2017performance year, the Compensation Committee
has chosen to maintain the payout parameters appliedin prior years. These are:
— Minimum: ifthe final Julius Baer TSR is —22% orless than the return otthe Index, the rTSRmultiplier will be 0%
— Target: itthe final Julius Baer TSR is +3% higherthan the return of the Index, the rTSR multiplierwill be 100%
7 Maximum: ifthe Final Julius Baer TSR is at least+28% higher than the return 01‘ the lndex, therTSR multiplier will be 200%
For the purposes of calculating the rTSR performanceover the th reeeyear performance period, the TSRwill be calculated using a fixed pricing period at thebeginning and end of the performance period. Thecalculation will be performed using the averageclosing price of the STOXX Europe 600 Banks grossreturn Index during the first and last calendar monthsof the performance period. This return will becompared against the TSR of Julius Baer Group Ltd.shares over the same period. The performance willthen be assessed against the atorementioned scale(-22% to +28%) to determine the multiplier.
Final evaluation ofKP/s
Once the KPIs have been measured at the end ofthe performance period, as described above, thefinal multiplier is calculated. The final multiplier used
in calculating the number ofshares ultimatelyallocated to plan participants is an average of thetwo multipliers (each individually capped at 200%)associated with the KPls. The final multiplier itself,however, is capped at 150%. The number of sharesultimately allocated to each plan participant is thencalculated as follows:
Number of shares vesting = final multiplier x numberof Performance Units granted
The final multiplier for the 2015 EPP programmewas 1500 as the average of the rTSR multiplier andCEP multiplier exceeded the plan cap. The finalmultiplier was significantly influenced by strong rTSRresults (reflected in an individual rTSR multiplier012.000), while the CEP multiplier, which wasadjusted to take account of actual acquisition andjointeventure factors which were not identified whenthe original targets were set, affirmed the Group’scontinued budget achievements over the past fewyears (reﬂected in an individual cEP multiplier of 1.242).
Similarly to the DBP, the EPP is also subject toForfeiture in the event of substantial breaches of legalor regulatory requirements, financial losses and avariety of other events where the employee's conducthas substantially contributed to a financial loss by
the Julius Baer Group or has caused it reputationaldamage.

The 2017 compensation paid to the new CEOreflects the defined base salary and cashibasedvariable compensation (DBP) for his previous CROrole. A large part of his equity-based variablecompensation (EPP) for 2017, with its forward-looking character and link to future Groupperformance, is reflective of his new role as CEO.Relative to the 2017 CRO base salary, the disclosedEPP award and the total variable compensationexceptionally and temporarily exceed the Group’sdefined caps as outlined in the ‘Compensation caps’section of this Remuneration Report. Overall, theEPP award, which is deferred for three years fromgrant and is fully at risk, constitutes over 50% ot thenew CEO’s total remuneration for 2017.

OTHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
This section provides details of the ongoingcompensation system for the employees of Julius Baer(excluding the Executive Board and SeniorManagement, whose compensation was addressedin the previous section). Swiss rules regarding thedisclosure of compensation concern the Board ofDirectors and the Executive Board. It is on thesepopulations that this Remuneration Report focuses.However, Julius Baer’s success also depends on thecontinued excellence of all its employees. Accordingly,this section discusses the salient features of thecompensation system For non—executive employees.
Key elements of other employee compensation:1. Simple and transparent total compensationstructure: base salary in cash, cash-basedvariable compensation and deferred variablecompensation when above minimum thresholds.Performance assessment: individual bonusallocation based on paying for success whereperformance is measured on both a quantitativeand qualitative basis, including such factors ascompliance and regulatory awareness.Balanced deferral scheme: deferred variablecompensation delivered in equal proportionsunder the Deferred Cash Plan (DCP)
and Premium Share Plan (P5P), which are bothsubject to forfeiture and deferred over threeyears to foster long-term orientation.
FIXED COMPENSATION
Base salary
The Group’s salaw framework is based on a functionalmodel comprising ten function levels, each at whichrepresents an increasing degree otjob complexity.
A salary band is assigned to each function level. Thisband defines the target base salary range torjobsassigned to the respective function level concerned.Individual salaries are then determined in accordancewith these salary bands taking market benchmarksinto account
The Group does not apply general salary increases(unless required by local legislation). Salaryadjustments are made on an individual basis whenemployees are promoted to a new function
level and/or based on the results of their annualpersonal assessment.

Pension programmes
Julius Baer offers competitive and market,appropriate pension programmes throughoutits global offices, All programmes are incompliance with local rules and regulations ofthe country in which they operate.
VARIABLE COMPENSATION
As previously stated, Julius Baer’s success alsodepends on the continued excellence of all itsemployees. The majority of permanent employeesat Julius Beer are considered eligible for cash—basedvariable compensation
Individual variable compensation amounts dependon the Formal year—end assessment of performanceagainst a range of quantitative and qualitativeobjectives (e.g. adherence to compliance andregulatory standards and to the Group policies, corevalues and procedures) as well as skills, expertiseand conduct,
As a result, in addition to the plans offered to themembers of the Executive Board (as describedabove), Julius Baer also offers various equity- andcash»based plans to members of the global staffpopulation Participation in these plans depends onfactors such as function level, overall variablecompensation, and/or nomination for participationin the relevant plan on an annual basis.

compensation plans are administered by theLOTECO Foundation
DEFERRED VARIABLE COMPENSATION
Generally, eligible permanent employees receivetheir variable compensation in one payment via ayear-end bonus, However, where awards exceed theminimum threshold (CHF125,000, or its localcurrency equivalent), a portion is subject to deferraleither in cash or equity.

The intention of this variable compensation paymix is to provide a balanced deterral scheme whichpromotes sound business activities that supportour core values and simultaneously allows employeesto participate in the long-term development
and success of Julius Baer.
Cash-basecl variable compensation
The Deferred Cash Plan (DCP) promotes soundbusiness activities by remaining subject to forfeiture(as previously described) while providing an
63
inherently less volatile payout than shares. TheDCP grant is made once a year as part ofthe annualvariable compensation awarded to the individualconcerned, and participation is determined on
an annual basis, These deferred cash awards vest inequal one-third trenches, subject to continuedemployment, and accrued over a three-year plan period.Where share-based plans are not permissible
under local legislation, employee annual awards are
fully deferred through the DCP.

Equity-based variable compensation
The Premium Share Plan (PSP) is designed to link
a portion of the employee’s variable compensationto the longeterm success of the Julius Baer Groupthrough its share price. A PSP grant is made once ayear as part of the annual variable compensationawarded to the individual concerned, and participationis determined on an annual basis. The employee
is granted a number ofshares equal in value to thedeferred element. These shares vest in equalone-third tranches over a three-year plan period. Atthe end of the plan period, subject to continuedemployment, the employee then receives an additionalshare award representing a further one third of
the number of shares granted to him or her at thebeginning of the plan period.
COMPENSATION ARRANGEMENTS INSTRATEGIC PARTNERSHIPS
In certain strategic partnerships, Julius Baer operatesspecial compensation arrangements unique
to the organisation concerned. Such arrangementscan include compensation linked to the strategicpartner entity’s shares or where regulatory required,compensation linked to the performance of thestrategic partner entity’s managed investmentfunds. No such arrangements are currently linkedto the shares of Julius Baer Group Ltd. However,share ownership requirements, defined in termsotJulius Baer Group Ltd. shares, are in place forsenior staff of certain strategic partnerships.
KEY RISK TAKERS AND REGULATED STAFF
In accordance with European legislation, Julius Baertakes particular care in identifying staff whoseprofessional activities may have a material impact onthe Group’s risk proﬁle (‘Key Risk Takers’). KeyRiskTakers are identified on an annual basis throughoutthe entire Group (Le. not limited merely to theEuropean Economic Area). Quantitative andqualitative criteria are both taken into considerationin the identification process. Defined minimumcompensation standards are applicable (in general)to members of the Executive Board as well as
64
employees (including relationship managers) with arelatively high total compensation and/or who hold afunction that has a high impact on the risk profile ofthe entity employing them or the Group. Regulatedstat]c (eg. Key Risk Takers) are reviewed by theCompensation Committee on an individual basiswhim also takes the potential payout volatility (payriskiness) of their total compensation into account.
The
num
European regulatory requirements include a:>er of provisions that impact the variableDensation awarded to employees and directorse Group entities that fall under the jurisdictione European Economic Area. To comply
with the applicable regulatory requirements, certainemp oyees (eig. identified Key Risk Takers) mayreceive 50% of their non-cleterred variablecompensation in the form of vested shares which areblocked between six months and one year (in lieuofwwat otherwise would have been paid in cash).
comotthotth

Furt'iermore, one of the central provisions of theEuropean Capital Requirements Directive (CRD IV)requires that variable compensation paid to specificindividuals (eg‘ identified Key Risk Takers regulatedunder CRD IV) shall not exceed the value oftheirfixed remuneration unless shareholder approval isobtained to increase this cap. The Julius Baerentities within the European Economic Arearequested and were granted approval by theirrespective shareholders to increase the variablecompensation cap to two times fixed compensation.
SIGN—ONS, GUARANTEES ANDREPLACEMENTS
Although Julius Baer only offers performanceebasedcompensation to its current staff (including theExecutive Board), it may in the course of itsrecruitment processes offer incentives for specificnew hires when theyjoin the Group. Additionally,retention payments may be made to current staffduring extraordinary or critical circumstances.
As a general policy, Julius Baer offers such forms ofremuneration only on an exceptional basis, typicallyin the first year of employment and in restructuringsituations.
===================================================
66.hocr: 
REMUNERATION REPORTOTHER EMPLOYEE COMPENSATION
A signion bonus may be made in the form of cashand/or shares and includes a minimum oneiyearclawback from the employee’s hiring date. Actualparameters may vary according to location, localregulations and the specific circumstances of thehiring process. Julius Baer may also ottercompensatory payments to new hires tor deferredawards they have forfeited by resigning from theirprevious employer by granting individuals deferredvariable compensation (as outlined below).
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTI)
An LTI granted in these circumstances generallyruns over a three—year plan period. Julius BaerCurrently operates two different vesting schedulesFor this plan: (1) three equal one—third trenchesvesting over a three—year period, (2) clitt—vesting ofall granted shares in one single tranche at the endof a threeiyear period. The shares are transferred toparticipants at the time of vesting, su bject tocontinued employment and any other conditions setout in the plan rules. In the event of termination ofemployment before the end of the plan period forany other reason than death, disability or retirement,unvested shares are Forfeited.
Where equity-based awards are not permitted ina specific location, awards are made in cash inaccordance with the terms and conditions in the DCP.
65
EMPLOYEE SHARE PURCHASE
Staff Participation Plan (SPP)
The SPP is offered to most of Julius Baer’s globalemployee population, Some individuals or employeesin specific locations are excluded from participatingbecause, for example, the employees concerned
are participants in another Julius Baer equity-basedplan or because the SPP cannot be offered in aparticularjurisdiction for legal or regulatory reasons.Under this plan, eligible participants may voluntarilypurchase Julius Baer Group Ltd. shares at theprevailing market price and for every three shares sopurchased they will receive one additional share freeof charge These free shares vest after three years,subject to continued employment. Purchases underthe SPP only occur once a year.
The objective of this plan is to strengthen theemployee’s identification with the Group, to encourageentrepreneurial spirit, to generate greater interest
in the business through ownership, and to provideemployees with financial recognition for theirlongiterm dedication to the Group.

BOARD OF DIRECTORS COMPENSATION
This section provides details of the compensationsystem for members ofthe Board of Directors. Thefigures for 2017 are presented in the audited‘Compensation, loans and shareholdings ofthe Boardof Directors’ section of this Remuneration Report.
Key elements of Board of Directors compensation1. Simple structure: fixed compensation, paid incash and in share awards, which is not linked toperformance, but based on the workload oftheindividual Board member.
Share ownership guidelines: minimum requiredholdings of Julius Baer shares (subject to athree—year build-up period).
COMPENSATION
Members of the Board of Directors (including theChairman) are only entitled to Fixed compensationfor their term in office. This fixed compensation isdetermined by the workload of the individual Boardmember based on the Board Committees on whichhe or she serves and his or her committee position.
The fixed compensation is paid in a combination ofcash and shares. Reflecting the independent status ofall members of the Board of Directors (including
the Chairman), the remuneration of members of theBoard does not include a variable component and
is therefore not dependent on the financial performanceof the Group. However, in order to align theircompensation with the interests of our shareholders,a portion of the fixed compensation is paid in theform of shares.
Generally, the cashibased compensation is paid inDecember each year; the Chairman receives thecash element on a quarterly basis. The cash elementis disclosed on a businessiyear basis (i.e. split
across the two calendar years that make up a Boardmember’s term).
66
At the beginning of each term, shareebasedcompensation is determined on the basis of a fixedtotal compensation value, The number ofshareswhich is granted is calculated on the basis of afiveeday marketevolumeeweighted average price ofJulius Baer Group Ltd‘ shares on the Swiss StockExchange prior to the grant date. This share-basedcompensation is delivered under the Group's LTIplan and remains subject to a one-year, service—basedvesting period over the term. This element isdisclosed at grant value in the year of election orre-election.
No dividend entitlements accrue or are paid on
the share—based awards until vestingi All sharesdelivered at vesting are unrestricted (subject to theGuidelines on share ownership as described below).Shares granted to all members ofthe Board
of Directors are subject to a forfeiture clause, underwhich the award will only vest ifthe Board memberconcerned fulfils the entire term for which he or shehas been elected or reeelectecl.
No additional compensation is paid to members ofthe Board of Directors for attending meetings.
A comprehensive benchmark analysis with regard tothe Board members’ compensation levels wasconducted in 2016. In this respect, it was confirmedthat the compensation levels ofthe members of
the Board of Directors were below those of directpeers as well as stood at the lower end of the Group’spositioning between the lower quartile and medianOFSMI companies. As a result, the Board members’compensation levels for the term from the 2017
AGM to the 2018 AGM, approved at the 2017 AGM,provided for an adjustment to the shareibasedcompensation per Board member (excluding tor theChairman) from CHF 100,000 to CHF 120,000.Similarly, the committee fees were also adjusted toreflect the increased workload of the BoardCommittees, which led to higher total cashibasedcompensation per Board member (excluding for theChairman), The total compensation andcompensation pay mix of the Chairman remainedunchanged,

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF ACCOUNTING
Julius Baer Group Ltd. is a Swiss corporation whichis committed to the private banking business. Theconsolidated financial statements as at 31 December2017 comprise those ofJulius Baer Group Ltd. andall its subsidiaries (the Group). The Board of Directorsapproved these financial statements on 30 January2018. In addition, they are submitted for approvalto the Annual General Meeting on 11 April 2018.
Amounts in the consolidated financial statementsare stated in Swiss francs The consolidated financialstatements are prepared in accordance withInternational Financial Reporting Standards (lFRS).Generally, the historical cost principle is applied,with the exception of financial assets at fair valuethrough profit or loss, derivative ﬁnancial instru—ments and financial investments availableeforesale,as well as certain financial liabilities, which aremeasured at fair value, and precious metals thatare measured at fair value less costs to sell.
USE OF ESTIMATES IN PREPARINGTHE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIALSTATEMENTS
In preparing the consolidated financial statements,management is required to make estimates andassumptions that affect reported income, expenses,assets, liabilities and disclosure of contingentliabilities. Actual results in future periods coulddiffer From such estimates.
Estimates and assumptions are used mainlyin the following areas of the consolidatedfinancial statements and are in part discussedin the corresponding notes: determining fairvalues of financial instruments, uncertainties inmeasuring provisions and contingent liabilities,allowance for credit losses, pension assets andliabilities (measurement of defined benefitobligation), income taxes (judgment regardingthe interpretation of the applicable tax lawsand the respective tax practice, such as transferpricing or deductible versus non-deductibleitems, and anticipation of tax audit issues),share-based payments, goodwill and other
92
intangible assets (determination in a businesscombination and measurement of recoverableamount) and contingent considerations.
ACCOUNTI NG POLICIES
All Group companies apply uniform accounting
and measurement principles, which have remainedthe same as in the previous year, except as outlinedat the end of this summary of significant accountingpolicies addressing implemented changes inaccounting policies
Business combinations
In a business combination, the acquirer obtainscontrol over the net assets of one or more businesses.The business combination is accounted for using
the acquisition method‘ This involves recognisingthe identifiable assets, including previouslyunrecognised intangible assets, and liabilities of
the acquired business at acquisitionedate fair
value. Any excess of the consideration provided,such as assets or equity instruments issued andmeasured at acquisition-date fair value, over theidentifiable net assets acquired, is recognised asgoodwill. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiaries and associatesInvestees in which Julius Baer Group Ltd. exercisescontrol are Fully consolidated. The following threeelements constitute control:
power over the investee;
exposure, or rights, to variable returns frominvolvement with the investee; and
the ability to use power over the investee toaffect the amount of the investor’s returns.
If the Group is exposed to all three elements, itcontrols an investeet The assessment is based
on all facts and circumstances and is reassessed asconditions may change.
A complete list of these companies is provided
in Note 26‘ The financial statements of subsidiariesare included in the consolidated financial statementsfrom the date that control is transferred to the Groupuntil the date that control ceases.

FINANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Companies in which Julius Baer Group Ltd. hasthe ability to exercise significant influence overthe financial and operating policies are reportedin the consolidated financial statements usingthe equity method. These associates are initiallyrecorded at cost as of the date of acquisition.Subsequently, the carrying amount is adjustedfor the post-acquisition change in the Group’sshare otthe associate's net assets.
The effects of all intercompany transactions andbalances are eliminated on consolidation. Gainsand losses resulting from transactions with associatesare recognised only to the extent of the unrelatedinvestor’s interest in the associate.
Foreign currency translation
The Group companies prepare their financialstatements in the respective functional currency.The balance sheets of Group companies that aredenominated in foreign currencies are translatedinto Swiss francs at the closing exchange rates
on the balance sheet date. Average exchange rates
for the reporting period are used for the incomestatements. Exchange differences arising fromconsolidation using closing and average exchangerates for the reporting period are recognised in othercomprehensive income. When a foreign operation
is disposed of such that control or signiﬁcant influenceis lost, the cumulative amount in the translationreserve related to that foreign operation is reclassifiedto the income statement as part ofthe gain or losson disposal.
In the individual financial statements of the Groupcompanies, income and expenses denominated
in foreign currencies are translated at the exchangerate on the date of the respective transaction. Assetsand liabilities are translated at the closing exchangerate on the balance sheet date. The resulting
gains and losses on monetary assets and liabilitiesare recognised in the income statement as foreignexchange gains/losses. Unrealised exchange ditferiences on equity securities availableiforisale are acomponent of the change in their entire fair valueand are recognised in other comprehensive income.
The following exchange rates are used for the major currencies:

The financialinstruments are assigned to one 01‘ the fourcategories according to IAS 39: loans andreceivables, helcl-to-maturity investments,financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities at fairvalue through profit or loss, and available-for-sale financial assets. They are uniformlyrecognised within these categories on tradedate or settlement date.
93
Income recognition
Income from services provided is either recognisedat the time the service is performed, i.e. uponexecution of a transaction, or in the correspondingperiods over the life of a contract it services areprovided over a certain period of time. Income andincome components that are based on performanceare recognised at the time when all performancecriteria are fulfilled and irrevocably earned.
Cash
Cash includes notes and coins on hand, as well asbalances held with central banks.

FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Due from banks and loans
Amounts due from banks and loans are initiallyrecognised at fair value, which is the considerationgiven to originate the receivable or loan, plus anyattributable transaction costs. Subsequently, thesereceivables and loans are measured at theiramortised cost using the effective interest method.
Loans are classified as past due when the counter-party has failed to make a payment when contractuallydue. The exposure is not considered impaired asthe Group believes that on the basis of the collateralavailable it is still covered.
Speciﬁc allowances: Loans and amounts due frombanks for which it is probable that, based on currentinformation and events, the Group will be unableto collect the whole amounts due according to theoriginal contractual terms of the loan agreement,are measured on an individual basis, and a specificallowance for credit losses is established for impairedamounts, if necessary. Related collaterals are alsoincluded in the evaluation.
Impairment is measured and an allowance For creditlosses is established for the difference between
the carrying amount of the loan and its estimatedrecoverable amount, taking into account the counter-party risk and the net proceeds from the possibleliquidation ofany collateral. The recoverable amountequals the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the loan's original effective interestrate. The allowance for credit losses is recognisedthrough the income statement.
A write-offis made against the established specificallowance for credit losses when all or part of a loanis deemed uncollectible or forgiven. Recoveries ofamounts that were previously written ohC are crediteddirectly to the income statement.
Collective allowances: In addition to the specificallowances for credit losses, a collective allowance forcredit losses is established to account for inherentcredit risks collectively, i.e. on a portfolio basis. Thiscollective allowance for credit losses is calculated
on the basis of faithfully estimated default rates foreach portfolio, which are based on internal creditratings that are used for classifying the loans.
94
In the balance sheet, the allowances for creditlosses are offset against the corresponding loansand amounts clue from banks.
Impaired loans are rated as fully recoverable ifthe creditworthiness has improved such thatthere is a reasonable assurance of timely collectionof principal and interest according to the originalcontractual terms.
Securi 'es lending and borrowing transactionsSecurities lending and borrowing transactions arecollateralisecl by securities or cash The transactionsare usually conducted under standard agreementsemployed by the market participants; the counter-parties are subject to the Group’s normal credit
risk process
Securities borrowed as well as securities receivedby the Group as collateral under securities lendingtransactions are only recorded in the balance sheetif the Group obtains control of the contractual rights(risks and rewards of ownership) associated withthese securities. Similarly, securities lent as well assecurities provided by the Group as collateralunder securities borrowing transactions are onlyderecognised from the balance sheet ifthe Grouprelinquishes control of the contractual rightsassociated with these securities. Securities lentand securities provided as collateral that remain
in the balance sheet are remeasured accordingto the respective position they are recorded in.The fair values of securities received or providedare monitored daily in order to provide or requestadditional collateral in accordance with theunderlying agreements.
Cash collateral received is recognised with acorresponding obligation to return it, and cashcollateral provided is derecognised and a cones,ponding receivable reflecting the Group’s rightto receive it back is recognised
Fees received or paid in connection with securitieslending and borrowing transactions are recognised
as commission income or commission expenses onan accrual basis‘

FINANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Repurchase and reverse repurchase transactionsReverse repurchase transactions and repurchasetransactions are considered secured financingtransactions and are recorded at the value of thecash provided or received. The transactions aregenerally conducted under standard agreementsemployed by the market participants; the counter-parties are subject to the Group’s normal creditrisk process.
Securities received and securities delivered are onlyrecorded in the balance sheet or derecognised fromthe balance sheet if control of the contractual rights(risks and rewards of ownership) associated withthese securities is relinquished as well. The fair valuesof the securities received or delivered are monitoreddaily in order to provide or request additional collateralin accordance with the underlying agreements
Cash received is recognised with a correspondingobligation to return it, and cash provided is derecogenised and a corresponding receivable reﬂecting theGroup’s right to receive it back is recognised.
Interest income from reverse repurchase transactionsand interest expenses from repurchase transactionsare accrued in the corresponding periods over thelife of the underlying transactions in the respectiveinterest positions.
Trading assets/Iiabilities
All trading positions are recognised at fair value.Realised gains and losses on disposal or redemptionand unrealised gains and losses from changes inthe fair value are recognised in net trading income.
Interest and dividend income and interest expensefrom trading positions are included in net interestand dividend income.
Precious metals held for trading purposes are measured at fair value less costs to sell with all changesin the fair value recognised in net trading incomes
Financial assets and liabilities designated
at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities may initially be desig-nated as at fair value through profit or loss (fairvalue option) if one of the following conditions is met:
95
they are hybrid instruments which consist of
a debt host and an embedded derivativecomponent;
they are part of a portfolio which is riskemanagedon a fair value basis; or
the application of the fair value option reduces oreliminates an accounting mismatch that wouldotherwise arise
The Group measures its issued structured productscontaining a debt instrument and an embeddedderivative at fair value, with changes in Fair valuerecognised in net trading income, thus eliminatingthe requirement to account For the embeddedderivative and its host contract separately.
In addition, the Group reports assets and liabilitiesrelated to certain structured investments for whichthe client bears all the related risks and rewards fromthe investments, as designated at fair value throughprofit or loss.
Derivative financial instruments and hedgingDerivative financial instruments held for trading,including foreign exchange products, interest rateFutures, forward rate agreements, currency andinterest rate swaps, currency and interest rate options(written options as well as purchased options),
are recognised at fair value through profit or loss.
In order to calculate the fair value, correspondingstock exchange prices, discounted cash flow modelsand option pricing models are employed. Derivativesare reported as an asset position if their fair value ispositive and as a liability position if their fair valueis negative. Changes in fair value on tradingpositions are recognised in net trading income.
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments
for hedging the fair values (fair value hedges) whentransactions meet the specified criteria to obtainhedge accounting treatment. Derivatives categorisedas serving such purposes on their trade date aretreated as hedging instruments in the financialstatements if they fulfil the following criteria:
existence ofdocumentation that specifies theunderlying transaction (balance sheet itemor cash flow), the hedging instrument as wellas the hedging strategy/relationship;
===================================================
97.hocr: 
FlNANClAL STATEMENTS JULIUS BAER GROUP 2017SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
a effective and reliably measurable elimination ofthe hedged risks through the hedging transactionduring the entire reporting period; and
sustained high effectiveness ofthe hedgingtransaction. A hedge is regarded as highlyeffective if actual results are within a range of80% to l25%i
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that aredesignated and qualify as fair value hedges arereported in the income statement. The changesin the fair value of the hedged item that areattributable to the risk hedged with the derivativeare reflected in an adjustment to the carryingvalue of the hedged item and are also recognisedin the income statement.
When fair value hedge accounting is discontinuedprospectively, any hedging adjustment madepreviously to a hedged ﬁnancial instrument isamortised to the income statement over theremaining term to maturity of the hedged item.
Certain derivative transactions represent financialhedging transactions and are in line with the riskmanagement principles of the Group. However, inview of the strict and specific guidelines of IFRS,they do not fulfil the criteria to be treated as hedgingrelationships for accounting purposes. Thederivatives are therefore reported as trading positions.Changes in Fair value are recognised directly in theincome statement in the corresponding period.
Financial investments available-for-sale
Security positions, including money market instru—ments, which are not held For trading purposes, arereported as debt and equity securities available,Foresale and are measured at Fair value. Unrealisedgains and losses are recognised in other comprehenesive income and reported in other components ofequity until the security is sold, or an impairmentloss is recognised, at which point the cumulativegain or loss previously recorded in other componentsof equity is recognised in the income statement inother ordinary results.
Equity securities are deemed impaired if there hasbeen a significant or prolonged decline of fairvalue below the acquisition cost. A debt instrumentis deemed impaired it the creditworthiness ot the
96
issuer significantly deteriorates or ifthere are otherindications that an event has a negative impact
on the future estimated cash flows related to thedebt instrument, ie if it is likely that the amountclue according to the contractual terms cannot beentirely collected
Interest on debt securities is accrued using theeffective interest method and, together withdividend income on equity securities, recognisedin interest and dividend income.
Property and equipment
Property and equipment includes bank premises,
IT, communication systems, leasehold improvementsas well as other installations and equipment.
They are carried at cost less accumulated depreciationand impairment losses Items of property andequipment are depreciated over their estimateduseful lives using the straightiline method.
Bank premises are depreciated over a period of
66 years, Leasehold improvements are depreciatedover the shorter of the residual lease term or
useful life. Installations are depreciated over a periodnot exceeding ten years, IT hardware over threeyears and other items of property and equipmentover Five years.
Leasehold improvements are investments madeto customise buildings and offices occupied
under operating lease contracts to make themsuitable For the intended purpose. It a leasedproperty must be returned to its original conditionat the end of the lease term, the present value
of the estimated reinstatement costs is capitalisedas part of the total leasehold improvement costs.At the same time, a liability for reinstatementcosts is recognised to reflect the obligation incurred.The reinstatement costs are recognised in
the income statement through depreciation ofthe capitalised leasehold improvements overtheir useful life
Subsequent expenditure on an item of propertyand equipment is recognised in the carrying
value of the item if it is probable that the Groupwill profit from the future economic benefits 01‘
the investment. Current maintenance and servicingcosts are recognised in general expenses.

On each balance sheet date, the items of propertyand equipment are reviewed for indications ofimpairment. if such indications exist, it is determinedwhether the carrying amount of the item is fullyrecoverable. An impairment loss is recognised if thecarrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount.
Leasing
Under operating leasing, leased assets are notrecognised on the balance sheet, as the risks andrewards of ownership remain with the lessor. Leasepayments for operating leases are recognised throughthe item general expenses in the income statementover the lease term on a straight—Iine basis.
Goodwill and intangible assetsGoodwill and intangible assets are classified intothe following categories:
Goodwill: In a business combination, the acquiree’sidentifiable assets and liabilities are recognised
at their respective fair value at acquisition date.Goodwill is measured as the difference between thesum of the fair value of consideration transferredand the recognised amount of the identifiable assetsacquired and liabilities assumed. Goodwill is notamortised; it is tested for impairment annually at thecash»generating-unit level, and an impairment lossis recognised ifthe recoverable amount is less thanits carrying amount.
Customer relationships: This position compriseslong-term customer relationship intangibles fromrecent business combinations that are initiallyrecognised at fair value at the date at acquisition.Customer relationships are amortised over theirestimated useful life not exceeding ten years, usingthe straighteline method.
Software: The Group capitalises costs relating to theacquisition, installation and development of softwareit it is probable that the future economic benefitsthat are attributable to the asset will flow to the Groupand that the costs of the asset can be identified
and measured reliably. The capitalised software isamortised using the straight-line method over itsuseful life not exceeding ten years.
97
On each balance sheet date, the intangible assetswith a finite life (customer relationships, software)are reviewed for indications of impairment. if suchindications exist, it is determined whether the carryingamount of the intangible assets is fully recoverable,and an impairment loss is recognised if the carryingamount exceeds the recoverable amount.

Income tax expense comprises current and deferredtaxes‘ The Group is subject to income taxes innumerous countries. Current income taxes arecalculated on the basis of the applicable tax laws
of the respective countries and are recognised
as expense in the financial year in which the relatedtaxable income arises. Liabilities related to currenttaxes are recognised in the balance sheet as currenttax liabilitiesDeferred tax assets and deterred taxliabilities are taken into account for the expectedfuture tax consequences of all temporary differencesbetween the carrying amounts of assets andliabilities for Financial reporting purposes and thecorresponding tax values.
Deferred tax assets arising from temporary differencesand from loss carrytorwarcls eligible tor offsettingare capitalised if it is likely that sufficient taxableproﬁts will be available against which those differencesor loss carryforwards can be offset. Deferred taxassets are reviewed at each reporting date and arereduced to the extent that it is no longer probablethat the related tax benefit will be realised.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities arecalculated at tax rates expected to apply in theperiod in which the tax assets will be realised, orthe tax liabilities settled.
Current tax assets and tax liabilities are offset againsteach other when they refer to the same taxableentity, concern the same tax authority, and anenforceable right to offset exists. The same ruleapplies to deterred tax assets and liabilities.
Current and deferred taxes are credited or chargeddirectly to equity ifthe taxes refer to items that arecredited or charged directly to equity.
Post-employment benefits
For defined benefit plans, the net defined benefitliability recognised in other liabilities in the balancesheet is the present value of the defined benefitobligation less the fair value of the plan assets as ofthe reporting date. The Group applies the projectedunit credit method to determine the present valueof the defined benefit obligation and the current andpast service cost. The corresponding calculationsare carried out by independent qualified actuaries.

All changes in the present value of the definedbenefit obligation and in the fair value of the planassets are recognised in the financial statementsimmediately in the period they occur. Service costs,including past service costs, and net interest on
the net defined benefit liability are recognised inthe income statement in personnel expenses. TheGroup determines the net interest expense based
on the net defined benefit liability for the period

The amountrecognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect thenumber of share awards for which the related servicesand non-market performance vesting conditions areexpected to be met.
Shareabased payment plans that are settled in
own equity instruments (Le. Julius Baer Group Ltd.shares) result in a corresponding increase inequity and are not remeasured for subsequentchanges in the fair value ofthe underlying equityinstruments.
