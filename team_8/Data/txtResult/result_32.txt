7. Resolution 11 is an Ordinary Resolution to empower the Directors of the Companyto allot and issue ordinary shares of the Company pursuant to the VicplasInternational Ltd Scrip Dividend Scheme to eligibie members who, in respect of aqualifying dividend, have elected to receive scrip in lieu of the cash amount of thatqualifying dividend,
8. Resolution 12 is an Ordinary Resolution to affirm the grant of share options thathave been made to Directors of the Company (“Directors) under the VicplasInternational Share Option Plan (the “Share Option Plan”).
The Company supports the position that the holding of shares by non-executiveDirectors for the long term is to be encouraged as a means to better align theirinterests with those of shareholders. Consistent With this, the Share OptionPlan (as approved by sharehoiders at an Extraordinary General Meeting of theCompany on September 20, 2010) enVisages participation by non-executiveDirectors.
Accordingly, share options were granted in financiai years 2011, 2014, 2015 and2016 to certain Directors pursuant to the Share Option Plan. A total 01‘ 26,000,000options were granted to Directors, of which 17,000,000 have been exercised,1,500,000 have lapsed, and 7,500,000 are outstanding as at October 13, 2017.All share options granted to Directors have been disciosed in the Company’sAnnual Report for the respective financial years.
These grants were to acknowledge the contributions made by the relevant Directorto the success of the Company and/or the Group. As the share options grantedto these Directors were not intended as an alternative to paying Directors’ fees incash or other form of emoluments in respect of their office, they were not requiredto be put to shareholders for further approval whether for the purposes of Section169 of the Companies Act, Cap. 50 or the Company’s Constitution.
Nonetheless, as a matter of openness and transparency, the Company is of theview that it is good practice to table the affirmation resoiution (as described above)at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, as well as to table proposed grants ofshare options to any nonvexecutive Director under the Share Option Plan at futureAnnual General Meetings for shareholders’ approval.

Corporate Governance Report
As at the date of this report, the SC is made up of three members, all of whom are noniexecutive directors:
Mr. Christopher P. Lee (Chairman, Non-executive Director)Mr. Yeo Wico (Member, Independent Director)Mr. Robert Gainesicooper (Member, Noniexecutive Director)
Principle 2: Board Composition and Guidance
The Board has five members, all of whom are non-executive directors. Two of the five directors are independentdirectors and they are Mr. Yeo Wico and Mr. Ng Cher Yan. Details of the directors’ shareholdings in the Company areset out in the Directors’ Statement.
The Board’s adoption of the independence concept is in line with the definition of an “independent director” set outin the Code. The key elements of fulfilling the criteria of an independent director are that, he is not a member of themanagement and is tree of relationships with the Company, related corporations, its 10% shareholders‘, or its officersthat could interfere or be reasonably perceived to interfere with the directors' exercise of independent judgement orthe directors’ ability to act in the interests of the Company. Every director is expected to act in good faith and alwaysin the best interests of the Company.
The directors contribute positively to the Company with their expertise and knowledge in business, accounting,finance, law and management. They also bring with them impartial judgement and independence in decision makingat the Board level and every director shares equal responsibility on the Board. The Board is of the view that itscurrent composition comprises persons who, as a group, provide the appropriate balance and diversity of skills,experience and knowledge of the Company, as well as complementary competencies in industry knowledge andcustomer—based experience, to meet the Group’s needs. The Company will continue to decide on appointmentsto the Board having regard to the merit of candidates and believes that doing so will be consistent with achievinga diversity of perspectives described above. From a gender diversity perspective, the Board has a femalerepresentation when Mrs. Gaines-Cooper joined the Board as of last November.
he NC is also of the view that the current Board size is adequate, taking into consideration the nature and scope oftie Group’s operations.
he Company’s Constitution requires all directors to offer themselves for re-nomination and re-election at regularntervals of at least once every three years. In addition, if a director is appointed by the Board between annualgeneral meetings (“AGMs”), that director is to offer himself for retirement and reelection at the AGM immediatelyfollowing his appointment. Thereafter, he is subject to retirement by rotation at least once every three years.
he directors standing for re-election at the forthcoming AGM under Article 115 of the Company‘s Constitution areMr. Ng Cher Yan and Mr. Christopher Paul Lee. At the recommendation of the NC and as approved by the Board,both Mr. Ng and Mr. Lee will be seeking revelection as directors at this forthcoming AGM. Mr. N9 is consideredan independent and non—executive director, If he is re-elected, he will remain as the Chairman of the AC andhe Chairman of the RC and a member of the NC. Mr Lee is considered a non-independent and non-executivedirector. If he is re-elected, he will remain as the Chairman of the SC. Key information on Mr. Ng and Mr. Lee canbe found on page 8 of the Annual Report 2017. There are no materiai relationships (including immediate familyrelationships) between Mr Ng and the other directors of the Company, the Company or its related corporations, oris 10% shareholders The NC recommends the re-election and re-appointment of these directors after assessingtweir contribution and performance (including attendance, preparedness and participation) and their effectiveness asdirectors The Board has accepted the NOS recommendation. Each member of the NC and Board had abstainedfrom deliberating on his/her own re—nomination as a director. A brief profile of each director is set out in the “Board ofDirectors section of this annual report.

Note:
l” The term “10% shareholders refers to person who has an interest or interests in one or more voting shares in the company; andthe total votes attached to that share, or those shares, is not less than 10% of the total votes attached to all the voting shares in thecompany. “Voting shares exclude treasury shares.

Corporate Governance Report
n the course of the financial year, the NC assessed the independence of Board members in light of Guideline 2.4of the Code which requires that the independence of any director who has served on the Board beyond nine years,rom the date of first appointment, be subject to particularly rigorous review.
Mr. Yeo was first appointed a director on 10 June 2008 and has held office as an independent director for morehan nine years, and the Code requires his independence be subject to rigorous review, The Board had conducted arigorous review of the contributions and independence of Mr. Yeo. The Board (with Mr. Yeo recused from deliberating)agreed that Mr. Yeo had expressed his views independently at all times, objectively and constructively challengedhe assumptions and viewpoints presented by the management and actively participated in deliberations at Boardmeetings. In this context, the Board is satisfied that Mr. Yeo’s long tenure does not impair his independence and heis able to discharge his duties as a director independently and objectively. He remained independent in characterand judgement and there are no relationships or circumstances which are likely to affect his judgement. In addition,he Board also reviews the performance of Mr. Yeo and concludes that he has gained good understanding ofhe Group's business and operations, and will be able to continue to bring invaluable expertise, experience andnowledge to the Board. The Board is therefore satisfied with Mr. Yeo’s performance and continued independence.=or the purpose of further evaluating the independence of Mr. Yeo, the Board has also engaged Foo Kon TanAdvisory Services Pte. Ltd. to review his independence.

Principle 3: Chairman and Chief Executive Officer
The positions of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer are held by separate persons in order to maintain an effectivesegregation of duties and an appropriate balance of power. Mr. Yeo Wico is our independent non-executiveChairman, He is responsible for the control over the quality and timeliness of the flow of information betweenmanagement and the Board and ensuring compliance with the Group’s guidelines on corporate governance. He alsoensures that Board meetings are held on a regular basis.
Mr. Cheng Liang is our Acting Group Chief Executive Officer. He has been part of the senior management team ofthe Group and he does not sit on the Board, He continues with his role and responsibilities in the pipes and pipefittings business of the Group whilst he is the Acting Group Chief Executive Officer.
Our Chairman and our Acting Group Chief Executive Officer are not related.
The Board does not have a lead independent director. The NC and the Board are of the view that the appointment ofa lead independent director is not necessary as the Board has sufficient independence given that: (a) the Chairman
and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer are separate persons; (b) the Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are not familymembers; (0) the Chairman is not part of the management team; and (d) the Chairman is an Independent Director.
Principle 4: Board Membership
Principle 5: Board Performance

As at the date of this report, the NC is made up of three members, all of whom are non-executive directors:Mr. Yeo Wico (Chairman, Independent Director)

Corporate Governance Report
The NC is entrusted with the specific task of recommending to the Board all Board appointments. This functionextends to recommendations by the NC on re-nominations having regard to the direo or‘s contribution andperformance. Factors taken into account include the director’s attendance and participation at Board meetingsand Board committee meetings in the financial year under review, whether the Board and he management havebenefited from an open and healthy exchange of views and ideas and the director’s competencies and contributions.
Periodic reviews of the Board composition, including selection of candidates for new appointments to the Board,are made by the NO as part of the Board’s renewal process. In considering candidates or new appointmentsto the Board, the NC takes into account various factors including the Current and mid-term needs and goals ofthe Company, as well as the relevant expertise of the candidates and their potential contributions to the Board.Candidates would be considered against objective criteria, having due regard for the bane its of diversity on theBoard.
The NC is also charged with determining, on an annual basis and where circumstances require, whether a directoris independent and, where a director has multiple board representations, whether the direc or is able to and hasbeen adequately carrying out his duties as a director of the Company. In determining the independence of directorsannually, the NC has reviewed and is of the view that Mr. Yeo and Mr. Ng are independent. The NC also reviewedand is satisfied that the non-executive directors who Sit on multiple boards have been abe to devote time andattention to the affairs of the Company to fulfil their duties as directors of the Company.

The NC is also mandated to undertake reviews on the performance of the Board as a whole, its Board committees,the contribution by each director to the effectiveness of the Board and training and professional developmentprogrammes for the Board. The NC assesses the performance and effectiveness of the Board and the contributionof each director as a whole on an annual basis. To do so, the NC has put in place a process whereby Directorsare requested to complete an evaluation questionnaire. The performance criteria in respect of the performance ofthe Board and Board committees include assessment of the Board’s size and composition, access to information,processes and accountability and Board oommittees’ performance in relation to discharging their responsibilitiesset out in their respective terms of reference. Individual directors are assessed on the director‘s attendance record,preparedness for meetings, participation level and contribution at meetings, analytical skills, knowledge as well asoverall contribution to the Board and the Board committees, as appropriate. Each member of the NC abstains fromvoting on any resolution in respect of the assessment of his/her own performance or reenomination as a director,
The number of meetings held by the NC and the attendance of its members are set out in the table of meetings onpage 14 in this annual report.
Consistent with the Code, the Chairman of the NC is independent and is not associated with the 10% shareholdersof the Company.
The NC and the Board in principle support limiting the number of directorships that an independent director caneffectively server However, the NC and the Board are of the view that the effectiveness of each of the independentdirectors is best assessed by a qualitative assessment of the director’s contributions as well as by taking intoaccount each director’s listed company board directorships, and any other relevant time commitments. if aquantitative limit on the number of directorships is imposed, the NC and the Board may have omitted outstandingindividuals who, despite the demands on their time, have the capacity to participate and contribute as new membersof the Board. All Board members have also confirmed that they are able to commit sufficient time for the scheduledmeetings and other ad-hoc meetings, and devote appropriate time for such meetings. Such confirmations are takeninto account in the NOS assessment of directors' contributions.
The Board does not encourage the appointment of alternate directors, and currently none of the Board members hasan alternate director.

(“FY2017”).
OVERVIEW
[n FY2017, revenue ofthe Group decreased by 16.3%to $63.7 million resulting from lower revenues fromboth the medical devices segment and the pipes andpipe fittings segment.
The Group recorded a lower net profit after tax of $32million for FY2017 as compared to a net profit aftertax of $5.3 million for the financial year ended July 31,2016 (“FY2016”).
Medical devices segment
Revenue for the medical devices segment was $249million in FY2017, a decrease of 23.9% from FY2016.This was mainly due to the substantial decrease inorders from its major customer (in line with previousannouncements) but was offset partially by increase inrevenue from other customers.
Despite the revenue decrease, the medical devicessegment further reduced its segmental negative resultsto $754,000 in FY2017 from $782,000 in FY2016 dueto improvements in automation, labour utilisation andcommercialisation of new projects which had a positiveimpact on both product mix and margin in FY2017.

revenue of $38.8 million for FY2017 as comparedto $43.4 million for FY2016, a 10.6% decline as

The pipes and pipe fittings segment achieved lowersegmental positive results of $7.5 million in FY2017compared to $10.9 million in FY2016. This decline wasmainly due to lower revenue, higher raw materials costand increased competition.

Key audit matters
How the matter was addressed in the audit

Impairment assessment of plant and equipmentused in medical devices segment (Refer to note11 to the financial statements)
As at July 31, 2017, the Group’s carrying value oftotal property, plant and equipment (“PPE”) amountedto $17,488,000, of which $8,480,000 relates to themedical devices segment.
Management has identified the cash-generating unit(“CGU”) of the medical devices segment and hasconcluded that all the subsidiaries in the medicaldevices segment in aggregate represent the lowestlevel of CGU in the medical devices segment.
As the medical devices segment continues to incura loss for the year ended July 31, 2017, there isa risk that the recoverable value of the PPE usedin the medical devices segment may be lowerthan its carrying value requiring an lmpalrmentCharge to be recorded against those assets. Theimpairment assessment process involves slgnificahtmanagement’s judgement and estimates mdetermining the key assumptions in the valueeineuse(”VIU”).
The key assumptions made by management indetermining the VIU include, amongst others, therevenue growth rates, gross operating margins,working capital changes, discount rates and terminalgrowth rates.


We obtained an understanding of the management’srelevant control around the valuation methodology andvaluation model by performing walk-through of therelevant control
We checked management's valuation model forarithmetic accuracy,
We evaluated management’s basis of determining allsubsidiaries in the medical devices segment as oneCGU.
We evaluated and challenged the key assumptionsincluding those related to future cash flow forecast,such as revenue growth rates, gross operatingmargins, working capital changes, discount rates andtermlnal growth rates.
We also engaged our valuation specialist to reviewthe reasonableness of the discount rate used indeterminlng the VIU.
We assessed the reliability of management’s estimatesby comparing the historical financial performanceof the medical devices segment CGU against thebudget.
We also performed a sensitivity analysis around thekey drivers to the future cash flow forecast, being therevenue growth rates, the gross operating marginsand the discount rates.
We have also assessed the appropriateness of thedlsclosures included in note 3 and note 11 to thefinancial statements in relation to the key sources ofestimation uncertainty and the key assumptions used.

Goodwill impairment assessment (Refer to note13 to the financial statements)
As at July 31, 2017, the Group has recorded goodwillof $1,084,000 which arose from the acquisition ofXentiQ (Pte) Ltd. (“XentiQ”) in February 2016.
The entire goodwill has been allocated to themedical devices segment CGU as the objective ofthe acquisition of XentiQ is to expand the existingcapability of the medical devices segment beyondmanufacturing polymer devices to electro-mechanicaidevices, for its existing and new customers.
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment at least annually.An impairment arises when the recoverabie amountis less than the carrying value of the goodwili.Management has assessed the recoverable amountof the CGU using VIU. The underlying assumptionsof the financial projections to determine the VIU hasbeen explained above.
We evaluated management’s basis of allocating thegoodwiil to the medical devices segment CGU.
Ail the procedures performed in the impairmentassessment of PPE as set out above were alsoappiicabie in reviewing the impairment assessmentof the goodwill as the underlying financial projectionswere the same.
In addition. we also assessed the appropriateness ofthe disclosures included in the notes 3 and 13 to thefinanciai statements in relation to the key sources ofestimation uncertainty and the key assumptions used.

Recoverability of deferred tax assets recognisedarising from the unutilised tax losses in ForefrontMedical Technology (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd (Refer tonote 19 to the financial statements)
The Group has recognised deferred tax assetsamounting to $1,500,000 as at July 31, 2017 arisingprimarily on unutilised tax losses of its subsidiary,Forefront Medical Technology (Jiangsu) Co., Ltd(“FJS”). These have been recognised on the basis thatmanagement expect FJS to realise the deferred taxassets.
The estimates of the likely timing and level of futuretaxable profits together with future tax planningstrategies require judgement and interpretation of taxlaw as well as estimating future profits determinedbased on significant management’s judgement andestimation of the assumptions underlying the profitprojections


We obtained an understanding of the management'sreievant control in preparing the future profitprojections and performed walk-through of thereievant control.
We checked management’s profit projections modelfor arithmetic accuracy.
We evaluated and challenged the key assumptionssuch as revenue growth rates and gross operatingmargins.
We compared the historical financial performanceof FJS against its prior year’s budget to assess thereiiability of management’s estimates
We checked the estimated accumulated tax lossesavailable to be utilised by FJS before their respectivetime bar period‘
We aiso performed a sensitivity analysis around the keydrivers to the future proﬁt projections, being the revenuegrowth rates and the gross operating margins.
Based on the above procedures, we assessedmanagement's estimates of the availability of futuretaxable profits in FJS to utilise the tax losses availablebefore their respective time bar period.
In addition, we also assessed the appropriateness ofthe disclosures included in the note 3 and note 19 tothe financial statements in relation to the key sourcesof estimation uncertainty and the carried forwardunutilised tax losses and their respective expiry dates.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are free frommaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordancewith SSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or errorand are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence theeconomic decisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professionalscepticism throughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraudor error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that issufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatementresulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery,intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
0 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theGroup’s internal control.
0 Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimatesand related disclosures made by management.
0 Conolude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, basedon the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that maycast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a materialuncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in thefinancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are basedon the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report However, future events or conditionsmay cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.
0 Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner thatachieves fair presentation.
0 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or businessactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsiblefor the direction, supervision and performance of the Group’s audit. We remain solely responsible for our auditopinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit andsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit,
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding
independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought tobear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.

Pipes and pipe ﬁttings segment
The construction industry in Singapore is expected toremain slow especially for residential homes. In publichousing, the number of BTOs launched in FY2017 waslower compared to FY2016 and the trend is likely toremain. In addition, changes to the Home ImprovementProgram for public housing have resulted in PVC pipingsystems not being required to be changed unlessfound to be defective. Lower demand is also expectedfor the private residential homes sector due to lowerconstruction activities.
In view of the lower demand in residential homes andincreasing competition in Singapore, the pipes andpipe fittings segment will continue to focus on civilengineering projects, regional growth and productexpansion.
The new manufacturing plant in Cambodia is currentlyexpected to be operational by the last quarter of thefinancial year ending July 31, 2018 and may generatenew revenue for the segment when it is ready.
Overall
In view of the challenges ahead for both the medicaldevices segment and the pipes and pipe fittingssegment, the Group will continue to exercise prudentcost management while developing new businessopportunities and strengthening the base for its futuregrowth.
DIVIDEND
Notwithstanding the lower level of profitability forthe Group compared to the previous year, we haverecommended the declaration of a final dividend of0.50 cents per share in respect of FY2017, subjectto shareholders’ approval at the forthcoming AnnualGeneral Meeting. If approved, this final dividendtogether with the interim dividend of 0.25 cents per
share previously paid, will provide shareholders witha total dividend of 0.75 cents per share in respect ofFY2017 - and will be the third consecutive financialyear in which the total dividend per annum of 0.75cents per share has been maintained. It is noteworthythat over a three year period, shareholders would havereceived total dividends of 2.25 cents per share, whichcontrasts positively against the traded share price onthe SGX of not more than 8 cents per share duringthe calendar month (August 2015) immediately prior tothe announcement of the first of this series of dividendpayments.
The Group’s ability to sustain this dividend track recordis dependent ultimately on its long—term businessfundamentals which will require capital to maintain,grow and develop. This delicate balancing of futureinvestment against current reward is an everlastingchallenge,
APPRECIATION
On behalf of the Board, we thank our customers,suppliers, employees and shareholders for theircontinued support throughout the year. In particular, wewish to express our appreciation for the relentless effortsand commitment demonstrated by our managementteam and employees in building our Group.

BASIS OF ACCOUNTING » The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost basis,except as disclosed in the accounting policies below, and are drawn up in accordance with the provisions ofhe Singapore Companies Act and Singapore Financial Reporting Standards (”FRSs”)
4istorical cost is generally based on the fair value of the consideration given in exchange for goods andservices.
:air value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderlyrahsactlon between market participants at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directlyobservable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating the fair value of an asset or a liability,he group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liablllty which market participants would takeinto account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, exceptor sharebased payment transactions that are within the scope of PBS 102 Share-based Payment, leasingransaotions that are within the scope of PBS 17 Leases, and measurements that have some similarities toair value but are not fair value, such as net realisabie value in FRS 2 Inventories or value-in-use ih FRS 36Impairment of Assets.

n addition, for financial reporting purpose, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2or 3 based on the degree to which the inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and thesignificance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which are described as follows:
0 Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that theentity can access at the measurement date;
0 Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for theasset or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
0 Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or Ilability.
ADOPTION OF NEW AND REVISED STANDARDS - On August 1, 2016, the Group adopted all the new andrevised FRSs and Interpretations of FRS (”INT FRS“) that are effective from that date and are relevant to itsoperations. The adoption of these new/revised FRSs and INT FRSs does not result in changes to the Group’sand the Company‘s accounting policies and has no material effect on the amounts reported for the current orprior years.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following new/revised FRSs, INT FRSs andamendments to FRSS that are relevant to the Group and the Company were issued but not effective:
- FRS 109 ﬁnancial Instrumentsi- FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (With Clariﬁcations issued)’
- FRS 116 Leases2
0 Amendments to FRS 40 Investment Property: Transfers of Investment Property’0 INT FRS 122 Foreign Currency Transactions and Advance Consideration’- INT FRS 123 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments2
‘ Applies to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2018, with early application permitted.2 Applies to annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2019, with earlier application permitted ifFRS 115 is adopted.
Consequential amendments were also made to various standards as a result of these hew/revised standards.
The management anticipates that the adoption of the above FRSS, INT FRSs and amendments to FRS infuture periods will not have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group and of the Company inthe period of their initial adoption, except for the following:
FRS 109 Financial instruments
FRS 109 was issued in December 2014 to replace FRS 89 Financial Instruments: Recognition andMeasurement and introduced new requirements for: (i) the classification and measurement of financial assetsand financial liabilities; (ii) general hedge accounting; and (iii) impairment requirements fortihancial assets.
Key requirements of FRS 109:
All recognised financial assets that are within the scope of FRS 39 are now required to be subsequentlymeasured at amortised cost or fair value through profit or loss (FVTPL). Specifically, debt investments thatare held within a business model whose objective is to collect the contractual cash ﬂows, and that havecontractual cash flows comprising solely payments of principal and interest on the principal outstandingare generally measured at amortised cost at the end of each accounting period Debt instruments thatare held within a business model whose objective is achieved both by selling financial assets and bycollecting contractual cash flows comprising solely payments of principal and interest on the principalamount outstanding, are measured at fair value through other comprehensive income (FVTOCI). All otherdebt investments and equity investments are measured at WTPL at the end of each accounting period. inaddition, under FRS 109, entities may make an irrevocable election, at initial recognition, to measure an equityinvestment (that is not held for trading) at FVTOCI, with only dividend income generally recognised in profit orloss.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)FRS 109 Financial Instruments (cont’d)
With some exceptions, financial liabilities are generally subsequently measured at amortised cost. With regardto the measurement of financial liabilities designated as at FVTPL, FRS 109 requires that the amount ofchange in fair value of the financial liability that is attributable to changes in the credit risk of that liability ispresented in other comprehensive income, unless the recognition of the effects of changes in the liability’sCredit risk in other comprehensive income would create or enlarge an accounting mismatch to profit or loss.Changes in fair value attributable to a financial liability’s credit risk are not subsequently reclassified to profit orloss. Under FRS 39, the entire amount of the change in the fair value of the financial liability designated as atFWPL is presented in profit or loss.
In relation to the impairment of financial assets, FRS 109 requires an expected credit loss model, as opposedto an incurred credit loss model under FRS 39. The expected credit loss model requires an entity to accountfor expected credit losses and changes in those expected credit losses at each reporting date to reflectchanges in credit risk since initial recognition. In other words, it is no longer necessary for a credit event tohave occurred before credit losses are recognised.
The new general hedge accounting requirements retain the three types of hedge accounting mechanismscurrently available in FRS 89. Under FRS 109, greater flexibility has been introduced to the types oftransactions eligible for hedge accounting, specifically broadening the types of instruments that qualify forhedging instruments and the types of risk components of non—financial items that are eligible for hedgeaccounting. In addition, the effectiveness test has been overhauled and replaced with the principle ofan ‘economic relationship’. Retrospective assessment of hedge effectiveness is also no longer required.Enhanced disclosure requirements about an entity's risk management activities have also been introduced.
Management is currently evaluating the potential impact of FRS 109 on the financial statements of the Groupand 0f the Company in the period of initial application.
FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts With Customers
In November 2014, FRS 115 was issued which establishes a single comprehensive model for entities touse in accounting for revenue arising from contracts with customers FRS 115 will supersede the currentrevenue recognition guidance including FRS 18 Revenue, FRS 11 Construction Contracts and the relatedInterpretations when it becomes effective.
The core principle of FRS 115 is that an entity should recognise revenue to depict the transfer of promisedgoods or services to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration to which the entity expects to beentitled in exchange for those goods or sen/ices. Specifically, the Standard introduces a 5-step approach torevenue recognition:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer.
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract.
Step 3: Determine the transaction price.
Step 4: Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract.Step 5: Recognise revenue when (or as) the entity satisfies a performance obligation.
Under FRS 115, an entity recognises revenue when (or as) a performance obligation is satisfied, i,e. when“control of the goods or services underlying the particular performance obligation is transferred to thecustomer. Far more prescriptive guidance has been added in FRS 115 to deal with specific scenarios.Furthermore, extensive disclosures are required by FRS 115.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)FRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers (cont’d)
In June 2016, amendments to FRS 115 was issued to provide clarifications on (i) identifying performanceobligations (ii) principal versus agent considerations and (iii) licensing application guidance, The amendmentsalso included two additional transition reliefs on contract modifications and completed contracts.
Management anticipates that the initial application of the new FRS 115 will result in changes to the accountingpolicies relating to rendering of services. It is currently impracticable to disclose any further information on theknown or reasonably estimable impact to the group’s ﬁnancial statements in the period of initial application asthe management has yet to complete its detailed assessment.
FRS 116 Leases
FRS 116 was issued in June 2016 and it will supersede FRS 17 Leases and its associated interpretativeguidance.
The Standard provides a comprehensive model for the identification of lease arrangements and their treatmentin the ﬁnancial statements of both lessees and lessors. The identification of leases, distinguishing betweenleases and service contracts are determined on the basis of whether there is an identiﬁed asset controlled bythe customer.
Significant changes to lessee accounting are introduced, with the distinction between operating and ﬁnanceleases removed and assets and liabilities recognised in respect of all leases (subject to limited exceptions forshorteterm leases and leases of low value assets), The Standard maintains substantially the lessor accountingapproach under the predecessor FRS 17.
Management anticipates that the initial application of the new FRS 116 will result in changes to theaccounting policies relating to leases as the Group rents machineries and land for its operation. It is currentlyimpracticable to disclose any further information on the known or reasonably estimable impact to the Group’sfinancial statements in the period of initial application as the management has yet to complete its detailedassessment.
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION - The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements ofthe Company and entities (including special purpose entities) controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries).Control is achieved where the Company:
- Has the power over the investee;0 Is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and- Has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The Company reassesses whether or not it controls an investee if facts and circumstances indicate that thereare changes to one or more of the three elements of control listed above.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION (cont'd)
When the Company has less than a majority of the voting rights of an ihvestee, it has power over the investeewhen the voting rights are sufficient to give it the practical abiiity to direct the relevant activities of the investeeunilaterally. The Company considers all relevant facts and circumstances in assessing whether or not theCompany’s voting rights in an ihvestee are sufficient to give it power, including:
0 The size of the Company’s holding of voting rights relative to the size and dispersion of holdings of theother vote holders;
- Potential voting rights held by the Company, other vote holders or other parties;0 Rights arising from other contractual arrangements; and- Any additional facts and circumstances that indicate that the Company has, or does not have, the
current ability to direct the relevant activities at the time that decisions need to be made, includingvoting patterns at previous shareholders meetings.
Consolidation of a subsidiary begins when the Company obtains control over the subsidiary and ceaseswhen the Company loses control of the subsidiary. Specifically, income and expenses of a subsidiaryacquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of profit or loss and othercomprehensive income from the date the Company gains controi until the date when the Company ceases tocontrol the subsidiary.
Profit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed to the owners of theCompany and to the non-controlling interests. Totai comprehensive income of subsidiaries is attributed to theowners of the Company and to the non-controliing interests even if this results in the non-oontrolling interestshaving a deficit balance.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financiai statements of subsidiaries to bring their accountingpolicies in line with the Group’s accounting policies
Changes in the Group’s ownership interests in subsidiaries that do not result in the Group losing control overthe subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying amounts of the Group’s interests andthe non-controlling interests are adjusted to reﬂect the Changes in their relative interests in the subsidiariesAny difference between the amount by which the non»controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value ofthe consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary a gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss and is calculatedas the difference between: (i) the aggregate of the fair vaiue of the consideration received and the fair value ofany retained interest; and (ii) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and liabilities ofthe subsidiary and any non—controlling interests. Ail amounts previously recognised in other comprehensiveincome in relation to that subsidiary are accounted for as if the Group had directly disposed of the relatedassets or liabilities of the subsidiary (Let reclassified to profit or loss or transferred to another category of equityas specified/permitted by applicable FRSs). The fair value of any investment retained in the former subsidiaryat the date when control is lost is regarded as the fair value on initial recognition for subsequent accountingunder FRS 89, when applicable, the cost on initial recognition of an investment in an associate or a jointventure
In the Company’s financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less any impairment innet recoverable value that has been recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS - Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using theacquisition method, The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the acquisition,date tair values of assets given, liabilities incurred by the Group to the former owners of the acquiree, andequity interests issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquireei Acquisition-related costs arerecognised in profit or loss as incurred.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition includes any asset or liability resulting from acontingent consideration arrangement, measured at its acquisitionedate fair value. Subsequent changesin such tair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition where they qualify as measurement periodadjustments (see below). The subsequent accounting for changes in the fair value of the contingentconsideration that do not qualify as measurement period adjustments depends on how the contingentconsideration is classified. Contingent consideration that is ciassified as equity is not remeasured atsubsequent reporting dates and its subsequent settlement is accounted for within equity. Contingentconsideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fairvalue, with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquiredentity are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and theresulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in profit or ioss. Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree priorto the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are reclassified toproﬁt or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
The acquiree‘s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognitionunder the FRS are recognised at their fair vaiue at the acquisition date, except that:
- deterred tax assets or liabilities and liabiiities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements arerecognised and measured in accordance with FRS 12 Income Taxes and FRS 19 Employee Beneﬁtsrespectively;
0 liabilities or equity instruments related to shareebased payment transactions of the acquiree or the
replacement of an acquiree’s share-based payment awards transactions with share-based paymentawards transactions of the acquirer in accordance with the method in FRS 102 Share-based Paymentat the acquisition date; and
- assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as heid for sale in accordance with FRS 105 Non-currentAssets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Non»controlling interests that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate shareof the entity‘s net assets in the event of liquidation may be initialiy measured either at fair value or at thenon-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the recognised amounts of the acquiree‘s identifiable netassets. The choice of measurement basis is made on a transaction-by-transaction basis. Other types of non—controlling interests are measured at fair value or, when applicable, on the basis specified in another FRSS.
If the initial accounting tor a business combination is incompiete by the end of the reporting period in whichthe combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting isincomplete. Those provisional amounts are adjusted during the measurement period (see below), or additionalassets or liabilities are recognised, to reflect new information obtained about facts and circumstances thatexisted as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
The measurement period is the period from the date of acquisition to the date the Group obtains completeinformation about facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date , and is subject to amaximum of one year from acquisition date.

REVENUE
In FY2017, revenue for the Group decreased by 16.3%to $63.7 million and net profit after tax decreased by40.6% to $3.2 million, as compared to FY2016.
The revenue forthe medical devices segment decreasedby 28.9% to $24.9 million in FY2017 mainly due to thesubstantial decrease in orders from its major customer(in line with previous announcements), notwithstandingan increase in revenue from other customers. Despitethe lower revenue, the medical devices segmentimproved its segmental results marginally by reducingits segmental negative results from $782,000 inFY2016 to $754,000 in FY2017 due to improvementsin automation, labour utilisation and commercialisationof new projects which had a positive impact on bothproduct mix and margin in FY2017.
The revenue for the pipes and pipe fittings segmentdecreased by 10.6% to $38.8 million in FY2017 from$43.4 million in FY2016 due to the general slowdownand increasing competition in the construction industryin Singapore. Its segmental positive results decreasedto $7.5 million in FY2017 from $10.9 million in FY2016.

Raw materials and consumables used decreased byonly 5.3% despite the 16.3% decrease in revenue inFY2017 due to higher raw material prices, especiallyresin used in the pipes and pipe fittings segment.
Purchase of finished goods for resale decreased by42.2% to $2.1 million in FY2017 from $3.7 million inFY2016 as the construction industry slowed and thepipes and pipe fittings segment purchased lesser itemsfortrading.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS - Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the statement offinancial position when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument andof allocating interest income or expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate thatexactly discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees on points paid or received thatform an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) throughthe expected life of the financial instrument, or where appropriate, a shorter period, Income or expense isrecognised on an effective interest basis for debt instruments.
Financial assets
All ﬁnancial assets are recognised and de-recognised on a trade date basis where the purchase or sale of aninvestment is under a contract whose terms reqUire delivery of the investment within the timetrame establishedby the market concerned, and are initially measured at fair value plus transaction costs, except for thosefinancial assets classified as at fair value through profit or loss which are initially measured at fair value.
Loans and receivables
Trade and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active marketare classiﬁed as ”loans and receivables”.
Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method less impairment.Interest is recognised by applying the effective interest method, except for short»term receivables when theeffect of discounting would be immaterial.
Imgairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assetsare considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events thatoccurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investmentshave been impacted
Objective evidence of impairment could include:
0 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or0 default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or- it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial reorganisation.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to beimpaired individually are, in addition, assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence ofimpairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s past experience of collecting payments,an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period, as well asobservable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment is the difference between theasset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the originaleffective interest rate.

Financial assets (cont’d)
Imgairmeht of financial assets (cont'd)
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assetswith the exception of trade receivables where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowanceaccount, When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the allowance account Subsequentrecoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in thecarrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
It, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be relatedobjectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised, the previously recognisedimpairment loss is reversed through profit or loss to the extent the carrying amount of the financial assetsat the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed what the amortised cost would have been had theimpairment not been recognised,
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the assetexpire, or it transfers the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the assetto another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownershipand continues to control the transferred asset. the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and anassociated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewardsof ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and alsorecognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Classification as debt or eguity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of thecontractual arrangements entered into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument.
Eguity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group afterdeducting all of its liabilities, Equity instruments are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuecosts‘
Financial liabilities
Trade and other payables are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs, and are subsequentlymeasured at amortised cost, using the effective interest method, with interest expense recognised on aneffective yield basis.
Interest—bearihg bank borrowings are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured atamortised cost, using the effective interest method. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transactioncosts) and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowings inaccordance with the Group’s accounting policy for borrowing costs (see below).

Financial guarantee contract liabilities are measured initially at their fair values and subsequently at the higherof the amount of obligation under contract recognised as a provision in accordance with FRS 87 Provisions,Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets and the amount initially recognised less cumulative amortisationin accordance with FRS 18 Revenue.
Derecoghition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group‘s obligations are discharged,cancelled or they expire.
CONSTRUCTION CONTRACTS - The Group accounts for income from tooling, moulding and maintenanceservices using construction contract method where the outcome of a construction contract can be estimatedreliably, income and costs are recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the contract activityat the end of the reporting period, as measured by the proportion that contract costs incurred for workperformed to date relative to the estimated total contract costs, except where this would not be representativeof the stage of completion. Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments are included to theextent that the amount can be measured reliably and its receipt is considered probable.
Where the outcome of a construction contract cannot be estimated reliably, contract income is recognised tothe extent of contract costs incurred that it is probable will be recoverable. Contract costs are recognised asexpenses in the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total contract income, the expected loss isrecognised as an expense immediately.
When contract costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less recognised losses exceed progress billings,the surplus is shown as amounts due from customers for contract work. For contracts where progress billingsexceed contract costs incurred to date plus recognised profits less recognised losses, the surplus is shownas amounts due to customers for contract work. Amounts received before the related work is performedare included in the consolidated statement of financial position, as a liability, as amounts due to constructioncontracts customers. Amounts billed for work performed but not yet paid by the customer are included in theconsolidated statement of financial position under trade receivables
LEASES — Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all therisks and rewards of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The Groug as lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-Iine basis over the term of the relevant leaseunless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which use benefit derived fromthe leased asset is diminished. initial direct costs incurred in negotiating and arranging an operating lease areadded to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised as an expense over the lease term on thesame basis as the lease income.

LEASES (cont’d)
The Groub as lessee (cont’d)
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value at the inceptionof the lease or, it lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability tothe lessor is included in the statement of financiai position as a finance lease obligation. Lease payments areapportioned between finance Charges and reduction of the iease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate ofinterest on the remaining balance of liability. Finance charges are charged directly to profit or loss, unless theyare directly attributable to qualifying assets, in which case they are capitalised in accordance with the Group‘sgeneral policy on borrowing costs (see below). Contingent rentals are recognised as expenses in the periodsin which they are incurred,
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the termof the relevant lease unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in whicheconomic benefits from the leased asset are consumed. Contingent rentals arising under operating leases arerecognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised asa liability. The aggregate benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straithinebasis, except where another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economicbenefits from the leased asset are consumed.
INVENTORIES - Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value Cost comprises directmaterials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringingthe inventories to their present location and condition Cost is calculated using the firstein, firsteout method.Net realisable value represents the estimated seiling price iess ali estimated costs of completion and costs tobe incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT — Property, plant and equipment are carried at cost less accumulateddepreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, over their estimated useful lives, using thestraight-line method, on the following bases:
Office equipment - 10% to 33%Leasehold property Shorter of 50 years or iease term which is 56 yearsLeasehold improvements 10% to 83%Plant and equipment 10% to 33%Motor vehicles - 10% to 33%
The estimated useful lives, residual values and depreciation method are reviewed at the end of each year end,with the effect of any changes in estimate accounted for on a prospective basis.
Capital work—in-progress are leasehold improvements, plant and equipment under construction at the end ofthe reporting period and not yet available for use. No depreciation is charged on capital work-in-progresst
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as ownedassets or, if there is no certainty that the lessee wili obtain ownership by the end of the lease term, the assetshall be fully depreciated over the shorter of the iease term and its useful life‘

The gain or loss arising on disposal or retirement of an item of property, plant and equipment is determined as thedifference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amounts of the asset and is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
INVESTMENT PROPERTY - investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for capitalappreciation, including property under construction for such purposes, is measured at fair value, Gains orlosses arising from Changes in the fair value of investment property are included in profit or loss for the periodin which they arise.
An investment property is derecognised upon disposal or when the investment property is permanentlywithdrawn from use and no future economic benefits are expected from the disposal. Any gain or loss arisingon dereoognition of the property (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and thecarrying amount of the asset) is included in profit or loss in the period in which the property is derecognised,
GOODWILL , Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that controlis acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwili is measured as the excess of the sum of the considerationtransferred, the amount of any non»controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’spreviously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over net of the acquisitioriedate amounts of the identifiableassets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceedsthe sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and thefair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is recognisedimmediately in profit or loss as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is hot amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually For the purpose of impairmenttesting, goodwill is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt from thesynergies of the combination. Cashegeneratihg units to which goodwill has been allocated are testedfor impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment lossis allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill aliocated t0 the unit and then to the otherassets of the unit pro—rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment lossrecognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary or the relevant cash generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is
included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposai.
INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Intangible assets acguired separately
Intangible assets acquired separately are reported at cost iess accumulated amortisation (where they havefinite useful lives) and accumulated impairment iosses. Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortisedon a straight-Iine basis over their estimated useful lives. The estimated useful life and amortisation methodare reviewed at the end of each annuai reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate beingaccounted for on a prospective basis.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)INTANGIBLE ASSETS (cont’d)Intanqible assets acquired in a business combination
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination are identified and recognised separately from goodwill.The costs of such intangible assets are their fair values at the acquisition date.
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at costless accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses, on the same basis as intangible assetsacquired separately.
The intangible assets pertain to inteilectuai properties and customer relationships acquired through anacquisition in prior years. These intangible assets are amortised on a straight—Iine basis over their useful lives.Management has assessed the appropriate useful lives to be 10 years and 4 years, respectively, for intellectualproperties and customer relationships, The estimated usefui iives and amortisation method are reviewed atthe end of each annual reporting period, with the effect of any changes in estimate being accounted for on aprospective basis.
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS EXCLUDING GOODWILL - At the end of eachreporting period, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determinewhether there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss If any such indicationexists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of the impairmentloss (it any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Groupestimates the recoverable amount of the cash—generating unit to which the asset belongs Where a reasonableand consistent basis of allocation can be identified, corporate assets are also allocated to individual cash-generating units, or otherwise they are allocated to the smaliest group of cashegenerating units for which areasonable and consistent allocation basis can be identified.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair vaiue less costs to sell and valueeineuse. In assessing valueeineuse,the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a post-tax discount rate thatreflects current market assessments of the time vaiue of money and the risks specific to the asset for whichthe estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted‘
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash—generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carryingamount, the carrying amount of the asset (cash»generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount.An impairment loss is recognised immediately in profit or loss, uniess the relevant asset is carried at a revaluedamount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (cash—generating unit) isincreased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount doesnot exceed the carrying amount that wouid have been determined had no impairment loss been recognisedfor the asset (cash—generating unit) in prior years. A reversai of an impairment loss is recognised immediatelyin profit or loss, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of theimpairment loss is treated as a revaluation increase.

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)
PROVISIONS - Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal orconstructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group will be required to settle the obligation,and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the presentobligation at the end of the reporting period, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding theobligation, Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the present obligation, itscarrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from athird party, the receivable is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be receivedand the amount of the receivable can be measured reliably.
SHAREeBASED PAYMENTS , The Group issues equityesettled shareebased payments to certain employees.
Equity-settled sharebased payments are measured at fair value of the equity instruments at the date ofgrant. Details regarding the determination of the fair value of equityesettled shareebased transactions are setout in Note 20. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments isexpensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number ofequity instruments that will eventually vest. At the end of each reporting period, the Group revises its estimateof the number of equity instruments expected to vest. The impact of the revision of the original estimates,it any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised estimate, with acorresponding adjustment to the equityesettled share option reserve.
Fair value is measured using the Trinomial Option PriCing Model. The expected lite used in the model has beenadjusted, based on management’s best estimate for the effects of nonetransterability exercise restrictions andbehavioural considerations.
Equityesettled shareebased payment transactions with parties other than employees are measured at the fairvalue of the goods or services received, except where that fair value cannot be estimated reliably, in which
case they are measured at the fair value of the equity instruments granted, measured at the date the entityobtains the goods or the counterparty renders the service.
REVENUE RECOGNITION - Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable.Revenue is reduced for estimated customer returns, rebates and other similar allowances.
Sale of goodsRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised when all the following conditions are satisfied:- the Group has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods;
0 the Group retains neither continuing managerial involvement to the degree usually associated withownership nor effective control over the goods sold;
0 the amount of revenue can be measured reliably;0 it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and' the costs incurred or to be incurred in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.

Rendering of services
ncome from providing financial guarantee is recognised in profit or loss over the guarantee period on astraight line basis.
ncome from construction contracts is recognised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy onconstruction contracts (see above).
ncome from the rendering of sen/ices that are of a short duration is recognised when the services arecompleted.
nterest income
nterest income is accrued on a time basis. by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effectiveinterest rate applicable.

Rental income
The Group’s policy for recognition of revenue from operating leases is described above.
BORROWING COSTS - Borrowing costs directly attributabie to the acquisition, construction or productionof qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a substantial period of time to get ready for theirintended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, untii such time as the assets are substantiallyready for their intended use or sale. Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specificborrowings pending their expenditure on quaiifying assets is deducted from the borrowing costs eligible forcapitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or ioss in the period in which they are incurred.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS » Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans areCharged as an expense when employees have rendered the services entitling them to the contributions.Payments made to state-managed retirement benefit schemes, such as the Singapore Central ProvidentFund, are dealt with as payments to defined contribution plans where the Group’s obligations under the plansare equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit plan.
EMPLOYEE LEAVE ENTITLEMENT — Employee entitiemehts to annual leave are recognised when they accrueto employees. A provision is made for the estimated iiability for annual leave as a result of services renderedby employees up to the end of the reporting period.
INCOME TAX - Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxabie profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from profit as reportedin the statement of profit or loss and other comprehensive income because it excludes items of income orexpense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are not taxable ortax deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is calcuiated using tax rates (and tax laws) that have beenenacted or substantively enacted in countries where the Company and subsidiaries operate by the end of thereporting period,

2 SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (cont’d)INCOME TAX (cont'd)
Deferred tax is recognised on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financialstatements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, Deferred tax liabilitiesare generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to theextent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differencescan be utilised, Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from goodwillor from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in atransaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiariesexcept where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that thetemporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductibletemporary differences associated with such investments and interests are only recognised to the extent thatit is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profit against which to utilise the benefits of the temporarydifferences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to theextent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the assetto be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settledor the asset realised based on the tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enactedby the end of the reporting period. Except for investment properties measured using the fair value model,the measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow fromthe manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the reporting period, to recover or settle the carryingamount of its assets and liabilities.
For the purposes of measuring deferred tax liabilities and deferred tax assets for investment properties that aremeasured using the fair value model the carrying amounts of such properties are presumed to be recoveredthrough sale, unless the presumption is rebutted. The presumption is rebutted when the investment propertyis depreciable and is held within a business model of the Group whose business objective is to consumesubstantially all of the economic benefits embodied in the investment property over time, rather than throughsale. The Group has not rebutted the presumption that the carrying amount of the investment properties willbe recovered entirely through sale.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current taxassets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authorityand the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Current and deferred tax are recognised as an expense or income in profit or loss, except when they relate toitems credited or debited outside proﬁt or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly to equity), inwhich case the tax is also recognised outside profit or loss (either in other comprehensive income or directly inequity, respectively), or where they arise from the initial accounting for a business combination. In the case ofa business combination, the tax effect is taken into account in calculating goodwill 0r determining the excessof the acquirer’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingentliabilities over cost.

In preparing the financial statements of the individual entities, transactions in currencies other than theentity’s functional currency are recorded at the rate of exchange prevailing on the date of the transaction.At the end of each reporting period, monetary items denominated in foreign currencies are retranslatedat the rates prevailing at the end of the reporting period‘ Nonemonetary items carried at fair value that aredenominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 0n the date when the fair value wasdetermined. Nonemonetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are notretranslated.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items, and on retranslation of monetary itemsare included in profit or loss for the period. Exchange differences arising on the retranslation of non-monetary items carried at fair value are included in profit or loss for the period except for differences arisingon the retranslation of non—monetary items in respect of which gains and losses are recognised in othercomprehensive income.

BALANCE SHEET
Cash and bank balances decreased from $18.5 millionat the end of FY2016 to $16.3 million at the end ofFY2017 as cash inflow from operating activities inFY2017 was less than cash outflow used for investingand financing activities such as the purchase ofproperty, plant and equipment, payment of secondtranche purchase consideration of a subsidiary andpayments of dividends.
Trade receivables increased by 14.6% to $19.0 millionand inventories decreased by 17.7% to $5.9 million atthe end of FY2017 (as compared to the end of FY2016)due to higher sales in the last month of FY2017 forboth the medical devices and pipes and pipe fittingssegments.
Other payables decreased by 9.7% to $5.2 million atthe end of FY2017 (as compared to the end of FY2016)mainly due to payment of the second tranche purchaseconsideration of a subsidiary.

WORKING CAPITAL AND CASH FLOW
Net cash from operating activities decreased to $5.3million for FY2017 from $11.5 million for FY2016 duemainly to lower profit before tax in FY2017 and moreworking capital being tied up in trade receivables dueto higher sales in the last month of FY2017 for both themedical devices and pipes and pipe fittings segments.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in Note 2 to the financialstatements, management is required to make judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carryingamounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. The estimates andassociated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to berelevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis, Revisions to accountingestimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period,or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
Apart from those involving estimations (see beiow), the management is of the opinion that any instances ofapplication of judgements are not expected to have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in thefinancial statements.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end ofthe reporting period, that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts ofassets and liabilities within the next financiai year, are discussed below:
Allowances for doubtful receivables
The Group makes allowances for bad and doubtful debts based on an assessment of the recoverability oftrade and other receivables. Allowances are appiied to trade and other receivables where events or Changesin circumstances indicate that the balances may not be collectible The identification of bad and doubtfuldebts requires the use of judgement and estimates. Where the expectation is different from the originalestimate, such difference will impact the carrying amount of trade and other receivables and doubtful debtsexpenses in the period in which such estimate has been changed The carrying amounts of the Group'sand the Company’s trade and other receivabies are disclosed in Notes 8 and 9 to the financial statementsrespectively
Allowances for inventories
The management of the Group reviews the aging analysis of inventories at the end of each reporting period,and makes allowances for inventory items that are identified as obsolete and slow-movihg. The managementestimates the net realisable value for goods for resale based primarily on the latest selling prices and currentmarket conditions. The carrying amount of the Group’s inventories is disclosed in Note 10 to the financialstatements‘
Useful lives of property olant and equipment
The Group depreciates its property, plant and equipment over their estimated useful lives using the straight,line method‘ The estimated useful lives reflect the management‘s estimate of the periods that the Groupexpects to derive future economic benefits from the use of the property, plant and equipment. Changes in theexpected level of usage and technologicai development could impact the economic useful lives and residuaivalues of these assets. Therefore, future revision to depreciation Charges may arise. The carrying amount ofthe Group’s property, plant and equipment is disclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont’d)Impairment of property plant and equipment
In accordance with FRS 36 Impairment of Assets, management performs an impairment assessmenton the recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment. The impairment assessment consideredthe recoverable amount of the property, plant and equipment using valueeineuse at CGU level which is thesmallest group of assets generating cash inflows independent of other CGUs that benefit from the use ofthe respective asset, through estimation of the forecasted discounted cash flows to be derived from theuse of the assets. The results of impairment assessment led to a reversal of impairment loss amounting to$861,000 in the prior year as a result of certain uncertainties relating to presumption of continuing use of thepreviously impaired assets no longer exist at the end of the reporting period. No reversal of impairment loss isnecessary in respect of the current year. The carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment,and details of the key factors considered in the impairment assessment is disclosed in Note 11 to the financialstatements.
Fair value of investment grogerty
The Group’s investment property is stated at fair value based on the valuation performed by independentprofessional valuer as disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements In determining the fair value of theinvestment property, the valuer has used and considered the income capitalisation method and marketevidence of transaction prices of similar properties, which involve the making of certain assumptions andestimates. The professional valuer has exercised its judgment and is satisfied that the valuation method,assumptions and estimates are reflective of the prevailing conditions in Singapore, where the investmentproperty is located. The carrying amount of investment property is disclosed in Note 12 t0 the financialstatements.
Income tax
The Group is subject to income taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Judgement is involved in determining theGroup-wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions and computations for which theultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilitiesfor expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due Where the final taxoutcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences willimpact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made. Thecarrying amount of income tax payable as at year end was $576,000 (2016: $1,619,000) and carrying amountof deferred tax is disclosed in Note 19 to the financial statements.
Deferred tax assets
The Group has recognised deferred tax asset amounting to $1,500,000 in previous financial year (Note 19)arising from unutilised tax losses of a subsidiary of $6,000,000 based on the future estimated taxable incomeof the subsidiary. The estimation of the future taxable income requires considerable judgement. Actual resultsmay differ from the forecast estimate impacting the future realisation of the deferred tax asset.

3 CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY (cont’d)Impairment of investments in and receivables from subsidiaries
Management reviews the investments in the subsidiaries periodically with the view of assessing whetherthere is any indication of impairment. To determine whether the investments in the subsidiaries are impaired,management exercises judgement and makes estimation of the fair value less cost to sell or the valueiiniuse of those investments and the nature of the underlying assets of the CGU. The value—in-use calculationrequires the management to estimate the future cash flows expected from the cash-generating units and anappropriate discount rate in order to calculate the present value of the future cash ﬂows.
The medical devices segment and pipes and pipe ﬁttings segment are assessed as separate CGUS by themanagement to determine whether the investments in the subsidiaries require any impairment.
In previous ﬁnancial year, a reversal of impairment loss amounting to $1,270,000 was recognised in profit orloss as a result of recovery of the recoverable amount of the subsidiary mainly due to the positive financialperformance of the subsidiary. Management is confident that the allowance for impairment for all othersubsidiaries, where necessary, is adequate.
The carrying amount of the investments in subsidiaries of the Company is disclosed in Note 14 t0 the financialstatements.
The receivables due from the subsidiaries are tested for impairment whenever there is any objective evidencethat these receivables may be impaired. For the year ended July 31, 2017, management evaluated therecoverability and assessed that no impairment was required, having regard to the historical and futureperformance and financial position of the relevant subsidiaries. The carrying amounts of the receivables duefrom subsidiaries are disclosed in Note 9 to the financial statements.
Imgairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value-ih-use of the cash—generatingunits to which goodwill has been allocated. The value»in-use calculation requires the Group to estimate thefuture cash flows expected to arise from the cashigenerating unit and a suitable discount rate in order tocalculate present value The carrying amount of goodwill at the end of the reporting period was $1,084,000(2016: $1,084,000). Details of key factors considered in the impairment assessment is disclosed in Note 13 tothe financial statements No impairment loss was recognised during the financial year.

(b) Flnancia/ risk management objectives and policies
The Group’s overall policy with respect to managing risk arising in the normal course of the Group’sbusiness as well as that associated with financial instruments is to minimise the potential adverseeffects of the financial performance of the Group. The key financial risks include market risk (includingforeign exchange and interest rate risks), credit risk and liquidity risk. The policies for managing these
risks are summarised below.
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in whichit manages and measures the risk. Market risk exposures are measured using sensitivity analysis
indicated below.
(i) Foreign exchange risk management
Foreign currency risk occurs as a resuit 0f the Group’s transactions that are not denominated intheir respective functional currencies. These transactions are from the Group‘s ordinary course of
business.
The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on sales and purchases that are denominatedin currencies other than its respective functionai currencies. The currencies giving rise to thisrisk are primarily United States dollar, Singapore dollar and Malaysia ringgit. Foreign currencyexposures are monitored by management on an ongoing basis. The effects on the Group‘s profitor loss arising from the effects of reasonably possible changes to foreign currency risk at the
end of the reporting period are shown below.

Financial risk management objectives and policies {cont‘d)

(iii)
Interest rate risk management
Interest rate risk refers to the risk faced by the Group as a result of fluctuation in interest rates,
The Group‘s exposure to interest rate risk mainly arises from the fixed deposits, bank loan andbills payable. The terms of repayment of bank loan and bills payable and their interest ratesare shown in Note 15 to the financial statements. The interest rate payable for the financelease is fixed at the inception of the finance lease, and the impact of fluctuation in short-terminterest rates on cash and deposits disclosed in Note 7 to the financial statements is relativelyinsigniﬁcant. Interest rate of the finance lease is disclosed in Note 18 to the financial statements.
As at the end of the reporting period, interest rate sensitivity analysis have not been presentedas the impact on the Group’s and the Company’s profit or loss are not expected to be material.
Credit risk management
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resultingin financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted a stringent procedure in extendingcredit terms to customer and monitoring its credit risk. Credit evaluations are performed on allcustomers requiring credit over a certain amount. Where appropriate, letters of credit, cash and/or advance payments are reqUired for new customers and those with an unacceptable creditassessment.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, grossed up for anyallowances for losses, represents the Group’s and the Company’s maximum exposure to creditrisk without taking into account of the value of any collateral obtained.
Further details of credit risks on trade and other receivables are disclosed in Notes 8and 9 t0 the ﬁnancial statements respectively
Liguidity risk management
Liquidity risk arises when the Group is unable to meet its obligations towards othercounterparties.
The Group finances its operations by a combination of bank borrowings and internally generatedcash ﬂows. Adequate lines of credit and availability of committed funding lines are maintained atall times to meet its obligations as and when they fall due
The directors are of the opinion that liquidity risk is contained given that the Group maintainssufficient cash and cash equivalents, and internally generated cash flows to finance theiractivities, and that if required, financing can be obtained from its lines of banking credit facilities.

The recoverable amount of the relevant assets has been determined onthe basis of their value-in-use through estimation of the forecasted cash ﬂows to be derived from the use ofthe assets. The key assumptions used for the vaiueeineuse catculation are those relating to the discount rate,growth rates and expected capital expenditure. The growth rates are based on the contracted and estimates ofprojected customer orders: The Group prepares the cash ﬂow forecasts derived from the most recent financialbudgets approved by management for the next five years. The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flowsof the CGU beyond the forecast period is 1% (2016: 1%), which does not exceed the Iong—term growth rate forthe relevant markets.

Groug2017 2016
$’OOO $‘OOOMedical devices segment 1 1084 1,084
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill mightbe impaired.
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined through valueeineuse calculations. The key assumptionsfor the value-ih-use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and gross operatingmargins. The growth rates are based on the contracted and estimates of projected customer orders.
The Group prepares the cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved bymanagement for the next five years. The growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows of the CGU beyondthe forecast period is 1%, which does not exceed the iongeterm growth rate for the relevant markets. Thediscount rate used in measuring value-in-use is 18.1%.
As at July 31, 2017, any reasonably possible Change to the key assumptions applied is not likely to cause therecoverable amounts to be below the carrying amounts of the CGU.
Based on the valueeineuse calculations, management is of the opinion that no impairment on goodwill isnecessary as the recoverable amount is higher than its carrying amount.

No deterred tax assets has beenrecognised in respect of the remaining $14,654,000 (2016: $15,412,000) due to the unpredictability oftuture profit streams.
