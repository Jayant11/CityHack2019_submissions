2.2
Summary 01 signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Changes in accounting policies
The accounting policies adopted are consistent with those of the previous financial year except in thecurrent financial year, the Group has adopted all the new and revised standards which are effectivefor annual financial periods beginning on or after1 January 2017, The adoption of these standards didnot have any material effect on the financial performance or position of the Group and the Company.
The Group has not adopted the following new IFRSs and interpreiation by the International FinancialReporting Interpretations Committee (lFRIC) which are relevant to the Group that have been issuedbut are not yet effective:
Applicable forﬁnancial years
Standards and beginningInterpretation Content on or afterIFRS 9 Financial Instruments 1 January 2018IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers 1 January 2018IFRS 16 Leases 1 January 2019IFRIC 23 Uncertainty over Income Tax Treatments 1 January 2019
Based on a preliminary assessment using currenily available information, the Group does not expectthe adoption 0! the above standards and interpretation to have a material impact on the financialstatements in the period of initial application. These preliminary assessments may be subject tochanges arising from ongoing analyses when the Group adopts the standards. The Group plans toadopt the standards in the respective effective date.
The nature cf the impending changes in accounting policies an adoption of IFRS 9, IFRS 15 and IFRS16 are described below:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 9 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of ﬁnancial assets.impairment of ﬁnancial assets and hedge accounting. Financial assets are classified according to theircontractual cash ﬂow characteristics and the business model under which they are held. Theimpairment requirements in this standard are based on an expected credit loss model and will replacethe IAS 39 incurred loss model.
This standard requires the Group to record expected credii losses on its trade and other receivables,derivative ﬁnancial instruments, ﬁnance lease receivables, ﬁxed deposits and cash and bank balances,either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. As the Group monitors closely the credit risks arising from theﬁnancial assets as deiailed in Note 39(c). the Group does not expect the changes of this standard tohave a material impact on the ﬁnancial siaiements in the period of initial application.
The new hedge accounting rules under IFRS 9 will align the accounting for hedging instruments moreclosely wilh the Group's risk managemeni plactioes. As a geneml rule, more hedge relationships mightbe eligible for hedge accounting. as this standard introduces a more principles-based approach. Theabove change is not expected to have a signiﬁcant impact on the current hedging relationships enteredinto by the Group.

Summary oi signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Changes in accounting policies (cont'd)IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
Under IFRS 15, revenue is recognised at an amount that reflects the consideration which an entityexpects to be entitled in exchange for transferring goods or services to a customer. This standardspeciﬁcally states that lease contracts within the scope of IFRS 16 Leases are outside the scope ofthis standard.
As the Group derives its revenue primarily from lease rentals, the Group does not expect that theadoption of this standard to have a material impact on the ﬁnancial statements in the period of initialapplication
IFRS 16 Leases
IFRS 16 replaces existing lease accounting guidance. This standard does not change the classiﬁcationof leases for lessors except tor more disclosures in the financial statements.
This standard eliminates the lessee's classiﬁcation of leases as either operating leases or ﬁnanceleases and introduces a single lessee accounting model. Applying the new model, a lessee is requiredto recognise right—uf—use assets and lease liabilities tor all leases with a term of more than 12 months,unless the underlying asset is of low value.
As the Group is primarily a lessor engaging in leasing aircraft, the Group does not expect the changesofthis standard to have a material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application.

Summary at signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may beimpaired. If any indication exists, or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, theGroup makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount,
An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's tair value less costs of disposal and its valuein use and is determined for an individual asset. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds itsrecoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂows expected to be generated by the asset arediscounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount ram that reﬂects current marketassessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. In determining fair valueless costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, it available If no suchtransactions can be identiﬁed, an appropriate valuation model is used.
For assets excluding goodwill. an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there isany indication that previously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may havedecreased. If such indication exists, the Group estimates the asset's recoverable amount. A previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed only it there has been a change in the estimates used todetermine the asset‘s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is thecase, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannotexceed the carrying amount that would have been determined. net 0' depreciation. had no impairmentloss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Subsidiary Companies
A subsidiary company is an investee that is controlled by the Groups The Group controls an investeewhen it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and hasthe ability to aﬁect those returns through its power over the investeel In structured entities. the abilityto control does not come from holding the majority of voting shares, but rather from contractualagreements. Entities are consolidated from the time that the ability to control begins and cease to beconsolidated when the ability to control ends.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE'SCOMMENTS
We are delighted to report net proﬁt after tax ofUS$587 million, which translates to a return on equityof1b.3%, as we grew the business In 2017.
Our industry continues to exhibit good health, withstable borrowing costs, robust demand for new aircraftand strong underlying airline customer profits allcontributing to the aircraft operating leasing sector'sgrowth. Passenger trafﬁc rose 7.6% in 2017, markinganother year of expansion at above-trend rates, withgrowth especially evident in Asia's emerging markets.Global airline load factors continue to set new records,hitting 81.4% for 2017, and suggest that the pace ofgrowth of the globai airline fleet in our target segment,being passenger jets with more than 100 seats, is beingmanaged in line with demand.

Against this backdrop, our delivery schedule of 74 aircraft for the year took the record as the most aircraftdelivered to BOC Aviation in any one year and the most aircraft delivered by Boeing and Airbus together to anyaircraft operating lessor in 2017. Three of our 74 delivenes were acquired by airline customers upon delivery andwe sold a further 30 aircraft, resulting in an owned ﬂeet of 287 at year—ehd, equating to a net growth of 41 aircraftin the owned ﬂeet We ended the year with a weighted average fleet age of three years and a weighted averageremaining lease term of 8.2 years, and the Company is amongst the best in the industry on both metricsv
Balance sheet growth — which reﬂects our investment in aircraft — is cruciai to establishing our revenue base forfuture years. During 2017 we invested US$4.15 billion in additional aircraft, growing the net book value of the fleetto US$13] billion from US$107 billion at the end of 2016. In addition to our record delivery schedule in 2017, ourpipeline (o(ailed 173 aircraft at year—end for delivery between 2018 and 2021, with 53 of these scheduled to bedelivered in 2018 alone, all of which are now pieced with airline customers. Committed future revenues from ourowned aircraft and those scheduled to be delivered amounted to US$153 billion, up 24% from US$123 billionat the end of 2016.
Our strategy of targeting a global client base continues to serve us well with around 54% of our ﬂeet by net bookvalue deployed in Asia-Paciﬁc, reﬂecting the robust growth in regional travei demand in that region, During theyear we added 17 new airlines to our Customer list and executed large multiraircraft transactions with airlines suchas Turkish Airlines, TAP Air Portugal, Chongqing Airlines and Air Europa,
Our investment has included latest technoiogy aircraft where we became one of the launch customers forthe new Boeing 737 MAX 10 aircraft at the 2017 Paris Airshowv We received the ﬁrst of our A320NEO andA350—900 aircraft in 2017, more of which are scheduled to be delivered in 2018, While we continue to placecurrent generation technoiogy aircraft at competitive rates, over 90% of our orderbook comprises the mostmodern aircraft variantsv We have capital expenditure commitments for future aircraft deliveries amounting toUS$79 billion as at 31 December 2017, which underpins the future organic growth of our balance sheet,

(b) Hnancialliabililies
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when. and only when. the Group becomes a party in thecontractual provisions of the ﬁnancial instrument. The Group determines the classiﬁcation of itsﬁnancial liabilities at initial recognition.
Financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value, plus, in the case of otherﬁnancial liabilitiesnot at fair value through proﬁt or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subseguent measurement
The measurement 0! ﬁnancial liabilities depends on their classiﬁcation as follows:(i) Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss
Financial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss include ﬁnancial liabilities held fortrading and financial liabilities designated upon initial recugnition at fair value. Financialliabilities are classiﬁed as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling inthe near term. This category includes derivative ﬁnancial instruments entered into by theGroup that are not designated as hedging instruments in hedge relationships
Subsequent to initial recognition. ﬁnancial liabilities at fair value through proﬁt or loss aremeasured atfair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financialliabilities are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
(ii) Other financial liabilities
After initial recognition, ﬁnancial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised oustusing the effective interest method. Gains and losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss whenthe liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.
Derecognition
Aﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation underthe liability is discharged or cancelledor expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender onsubstantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modiﬁed, such anexchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a de-recogniiion of the original liability and the recognitionof a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in proﬁt orloss.

Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Financial instruments (canl'd)(c) Oﬂsetling of ﬁnancial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the statementof ﬁnancial position, when and only when, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off therecognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on a net basis. or to realise the assets andsettle the liabilities simultaneously.
Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at the end of each year whether there is any objective evidence that a financialasset or a group of ﬁnancial assets is impaired.
For ﬁnancial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group ﬁrst assesses whether objective evidence ofimpairment exists individually tor ﬁnancial assets that are individually significant, or collectively forﬁnancial assets that are not individually signiﬁcant. If the Group determines that no objective evidenceof impairment exists for an individually assessed ﬁnancial asset, whether signiﬁcant or not, it includesthe asset in a group of ﬁnancial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessesthem [or impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairmentloss is, Dr continues to be, recognised are not included in a collective assessment at impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on loans and receivables carried at amortisedcost has been incurred. the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset'scarrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the financialasset's original effective interest rate (that is, the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition).I! a loan has a variable interest rate. the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the currenteffective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowanceaccount, The amount of loss is recognised in profit or loss,
When the asset becomes uncollectible. the carrying amount 0! impaired ﬁnancial assets is reduceddirectly or if an amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowanceaccount are written off against the carrying value of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has beenincurred. the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant ﬁnancialdifﬁculties of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments,
If. in a subsequent period. the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can berelated objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previouslyrecognised impairment loss is reversed, Any subsequent reversal of an impairment loss is recognisedin profit or loss to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its amortised costat the reversal date.

Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative ﬁnancial instruments such as cross-currency interest rate swap, interestrate swap and foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge its risks associated with Ioreign currencyand interest rate fluctuations. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair valueson the date on which derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently re-measured at fairvalue. Derivative financial instruments are carried as assets when the fair values are positive and asliabilities when the fair values are negative.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair values on derivative financial instruments that do notqualify for hedge accounting are recognised in proﬁt or loss.
The lair values of cross»currency interest rate swap. interest rate swap and foreign exchange forwardcontracts are determined by marked-to-market values provided by counterparties which approximatefair value.
The Group applies hedge accounting for certain hedging relationships which qualify for hedgeaccounting.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classiﬁed as:
(a) Fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair values 0! a recognised assetor liability that is attributable to a particular risk and could affect proﬁt or loss; and
(b) Cash ﬂow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable toa particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecasttransaction and could affect proﬁt or loss.
At the inception of a hedge relationship, the Group formally designates and documents the hedgerelationship to which the Group wishes to apply hedge accounting and the risk management objectiveand strategy for undertaking the hedge The documentation includes identification of the hedginginstrument, the hedged item or transaction, the nature of the risk being hedged and how the entity willassess the hedging instmment‘s effectiveness in offsetting the exposure to changes in the hedgeditem's lair values or cash ﬂows attributable to the hedged risk. Such hedges are expected to be highlyeffective in achieving offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows and are assessed on an ongoingbasis to determine that they actually have been highly effective throughout the years for which theywere designated.

Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities (cont'd)
Hedges which meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for as follows:
(a) Fair value hedges
For fair value hedges. the carrying amount 0! the hedged item is adjusted for gains and lossesattributable to the risk being hedged, the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains andlosses Irom both are recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Cash flow hedges
For cash flow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument isrecognised in hedging reserve, while the ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Amounts recognised in hedging reserve are transferred to profit or loss when the hedgedtransaction affects profit or loss, such as when hedged financial income or ﬁnancial expense isrecognised or when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where the hedged item is the cost of anon-financial asset or liability. the amounts recognised in hedging reserve are translerred to theinitial carrying amount of the non-ﬁnancial asset or liability.
If the forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur. amounts previously recognised inhedging reserve are transferred to profit or loss. If the hedging instrument expires or is sold,terminated or exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked.amounts previously recognised in hedging reserve remain in other comprehensive income untilthe forecast transaction occurs. If the related transaction is not expected to occur, the amount isrecognised in profit or loss.
Pro visions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a resultof a past event, it is probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will berequired tn settle the obligaticn and the amount of the obligaticn can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each year and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If itis no longer probable that an outﬂow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation,the provision is reversed, It the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discountedusing a current pre—tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. Whendiscounting is used. the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a ﬁnancecost

Summary of signiﬁcant accounting policies (cont'd)Maintenance reserves
The cost of aircraft maintenance, repairs, overhauls and compliance with return conditions for aircrafton operating lease are paid for by the lessee. For major airtrame, engine and other maintenanceevents, the lessee will be required to make a maintenance contribution payment to the lessor. Certainlease agreements require the lessee to make the maintenance contribution payments on a monthlybasis while other leases require the lessee to make the maintenance contribution payment in the formof a return compensation payment at the end of the lease. Upon receipt by the Group, these monthlyand end at lease maintenance payments are accounted for as maintenance reserve liabilities becausethe Group generally reimburses the lessee or a subsequent lessee out of the payments the Groupreceived when the Group is satisﬁed that the qualifying major maintenance event has been performed.Upon expiry of a lease, any shortfall that is identified in the maintenance reserve liabilities for an aircraftas compared to the expected tuture reimbursement obligations to a lessee, or any surplus. will becharged or released to proﬁt or loss. Upon sale of an aircraft, the maintenance reserve liability for thataircraft which is not transferred to the buyer will be released to proﬁt or loss.
If a lease requires the lessee to pay return compensation payments at the end of the lease, certainlessees are required to secure all or a portion of that obligation by a cash deposit or letter of credit. Insome cases. the monthly maintenance payments or end of lease return compensation payments maybe replaced by commitments from a third party, typically the original equipment manufacturer or anaffiliate, which is providing flight hour—based support to the lessee.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that the Group incurs in connection with theborrowing of funds. Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they aredirectly attributable to the acquisition. construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation ofborrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended use is in progress,and the expenditure of the asset and borrowing costs are incurred, Borrowing costs are capitaliseduntil the assets are substantially completed for their intended use. The Group borrows to financecertain aircraft pre-delivery payments for aircraft under construction The interest incurred onborrowings directly attributable to the acquisition of the aircraft under construction is capitalised andincluded in the cost of the aircraft, except for the interest incurred fur aircraft pre-delivery paymentsarising from lease commitment or advances of pre-delivery payments on which the Group earnsincome. Capitalisation of interest ceases when the aircraft is delivered. All other borrowing costs areexpensed in the period they occur.
Debt issue casts
Debt issue costs are costs incurred in connection with obtaining ﬁnancing. These costs compriseprimarily frontend fees. agency tees and legal tees,
On initial recognition of a financial liability. debt issue costs that are directly attributable to theacquisition of the financial liability are included in the initial measurement of that liability. These costsare amortised over the related life of the debt using the effective interest method and written off uponprepayment o! the financial liability, except for those debt issue costs relating to credit tacilities whichremain available for re-drawing after prepayment.

(a) Where the Group or the Company is the lessor
Leases where the Group or the Company retains substantially all the risks and rewards ofownership of the asset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiatingan operating lease are added to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over thelease term on the same basis as rental income. The accounting policy for rental income is set outin Note 2.20. Contingent rents are recognised as revenue in the period in which they are earned.
Finance leases, which effectively transfer to lessee substantially all the risks and beneﬁtsincidental to ownership of the leased asset, are recognised at the inception of the lease term atthe fair value oi the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments,Lease receipts are apportioned between the ﬁnance income and reduction of the leased asset soas to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the asset. Finance incomeare charged direme to proﬁt or loss.
(b) Where the Group or the Company is the lessee
Finance leases, which effectively transfer to the Group or the Company substantially all the risksand benefits incidental to ownership of the leased asset, are capitalised at the inception of thelease term at the fair value of the leased asset or. ii lower. at the present value of the minimumlease payments and disclosed under Note 36. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amountcapitalised Lease payments are apportioned between the ﬁnance charges and reduction of thelease liability so as to achieve a constant rate oi interest on the remaining balance at the liability.Finance charges are charged directly to profit or loss.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life ofthe assetand the lease term, it there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership of theleased asset by the end of the lease term.
Leases where the lessor eﬁectively retains substantially all the risks and benefits of ownership
during the lease term are classiﬁed as operating leases. Operating lease payments are recognisedas an expense in profit or loss on a straithine basis over the lease term.

The tax rates and tax lawsused to compute the amount are those that are enacted or substantively enacted at the end ofeach year, in the countries where the Group opemtes and generates taxable income.
Current income taxes are recognised in proﬁt or loss except to the extent that the tax relates toitems recognised outside proﬁt or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.Management periodically evaluates positions taken in the tax returns with respect to situations inwhich applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions whereappropriate.

Active hebihty management remains a hallmark at our Company and has been instrumental in developing thesound 1iabi|ity platform upon which our ﬂeet growth is ﬁnanced. During the year we took advantage of investordemand to extend our debt maturit1es at low interest rates. We ra1sed US$29 bi1lion in total debt, includingUS$2 billion from bond markets. As at 31 December 2017, fixed rate instruments accounted for 47% of ourborrowings, up from 43% at the end 012016 as the proportion of ﬁxed rate leases in the portfolio increased. Ourcash and undrawn lines of cred1t rema1ned robust at US$4 b1|1ion at the end of 2017.
Total revenues and other income rose 17% to US$14 billion. Investment in our ﬂeet and a stable net lease yie1dhelped drive the growth1n both leasing revenue and core lease rental contribution‘. Lease revenue ofUS$1.3 billionrose 22% compared with 2016, while core 1ease rental contribution increased 24% to US$542 million. Our netlease y1e|d continued to be stable at 8.4% as we held our average cost of debt at 2.8%, compared with 2.5% in2016, and increased the proportion of our leases on higher margin fixed-rate bases to 66% of the total lease book.Revenue contributions from gains on aircraft sales totalled US$78 million compared with US$91 million in 2016,reﬂecting the seven fewer aircraft sold compared with 2016, Our aircraft sa1es programme allowed us to retain ourhighrqua1ity,youngfleet and long average remaimhg lease term.
Operating marginz rose margihaHy to 42.2% as we focused on reducing margins assoc1ated with our debt costs.Reported earnings received a boost trom changes in the us tax code, which saw the federal corporate incometax rate cut to 21% from 35%. This allowed us to make a non-cash US$91 million adjustment in net deferred taxliabilities. With headcount essentially ﬂat at 151 employees, our net profit after tax per employee3 increased 34%to US$39 million as efficiency continued to improve.
Our focus on cashflow and cash collecﬁon continued in 2017 and we generated US$13 billion in net cashflowfrom operating activit1es, W1th portfolio utilisation of 99.8% and cash collection 0199.996 maintaining our nearperfect records for both metrics,
BOC Aviation started its 25th year in its best condition ever, with |iquid1ty, balance sheet and earnings outlookdeliberately structured for expansion.

The carrying amount 0' deterred tax assets is reviewed at the end 0' each year and reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all orpart of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed atthe end of each year and are recognised to the extent that it has become probable that futuretaxable profit will alluw the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax Iates that are expected to apply in theyear when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) thathave been enacted or substantively enacted at the end of each year.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside proﬁt or loss is recognised outside profit or loss.Deferred tax items are recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in othercomprehensive income or directly in equity and deterred lax arising from a business combinationis adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred tax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to setoff current income tax assets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate tothe same taxable entity and the same lax authority,
Contingencies
A contingent liability is:
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only bythe occurrence or non-occurrenoe of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within thecontrol of the Group; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:

Signiﬁcant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the Group's consolidated ﬁnancial statements requires management to makejudgments. estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues. expenses.assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each year. Uncertaintyabout these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment tothe carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods,
Judgments made in applying accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the followingjudgments which have significant eﬂect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
(a) Carrying value of aimraft
The Group follows the guidance provided by IAS 36 Impairment of Assets in determining whetherit is necessary to recognise any impairment loss on an aircraft. Management exercises significantjudgment in determining whether there is any indication that any aircraft may have been impaired.This exercise involves management to consider both internal and external sources of informationwhich include but are not limited to: observable indications that the value of aircraft has declinedduring the period signiﬁcantly more than would be expected as a result 0! the passage of time ornormal use; significant adverse changes in the expected usage of the aircraft, technological oraviation environment that have taken place or will take place in the near future; significant increasein market interest rates; evidence oi obsolescence or physical damage of the aircraft; and worsethan expected economic performance of the aircraft.

Signiﬁcant accounting judgments and estimates (cont‘d)Judgments made in applying accounting policies (cont'd)(f) Deferred income taxes (coni’d)
The Company was granted a concessionary income tax rate of 5% for five years from 1 July 2012to 30 June 2017 under the Aircraft Leasing Scheme incentive (“ALS) that is administered by theEconomic Development Board of Singapore (“EDB'lt The Company has met all the conditionsrequired to qualify for the five years of concessionary tax rate of 5%. In January 2017, theCumpany was awarded the ALS for another five-year period from 1 July 2017 to 30 June 2022 atthe same concessionary income tax rate of 5%. subject to meeting certain conditions.Management is reasonably conﬁdent that the conditions will be met.
For ALS awarded to companies on or after 1 April 2017, a concessionary income tax rate of 8%would apply. However, since the Company was awarded the ALS prior to 1 April 2017, theconcessionary income tax rate of 5% has been used to compute the Company's deferred incometaxes.
Details have been disclosed in Note 11 and Note 26.
(g) Assets held for saleAn asset is classified as held for sale when the asset is available for immediate sale in its presentcondition subject only to terms that are usual and customary and the sale is highly probable.

Signiﬁcant accounting judgments and estimates (cont‘d)Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the endof each year are discussed below The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parametersavailable when the ﬁnancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptionsabout future developmenls, however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arisingbeyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reﬂected in the assumptions when they occur.
(a) Depreciation of aircraft and estimation of residual values
Aircraft are depreciated on a straight—line basis over 25 years with 15% residual value at the end0! 25m year for the ﬁrst 12 years. The remaining value at the end of 12th year is depreciated usingstraight—line basis with no residual value over the remaining 13 years, Management estimates theuseful life to be 25 years based on the common life expectancies applied in the aircraft leasingindustry.
Changes in the expected level of usage and technological developments could impact theeconomic useful lives and the residual values of these assets. Therefore, in these circumstances,future depreciation charges could be revised‘ A one-year decrease in the expected useful lives ofthese assets from management's estimates would result in an increase in annual depreciationcharges of US$213 million (2016: US$168 million). Such a decrease in the useful lives of theGroup’s aircraft could affect the Group's annual proﬁt belore lax in future
(b) Fair values
Fair values of the derivative ﬁnancial instruments have been determined by marked-to-marketvalues provided by oounterpariies as disclosed in Note 13.
Fair values of other ﬁnancial instruments have been disclosed in Note 38.(0) Income taxes and deferred income taxes
The Gruup has exposure to inccme taxes in numerous jurisdictions. Estimation is involved indetermining the Group-wide provision for income taxes‘ There are certain transactions andcomputations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course ofbusiness. The Group recognises liabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whetheradditional taxes will be due. Where the final iax outcome of these matters is different from theamounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferredincome tax provisions in the period in which such delerminalion is made.
Details have been disclosed in Note 11 and Note 26.

As at 31 December 2017. the nominal amount of the above cross—currency interest rate swapsamounted to US$251.3 million (2016: US$148.9 million). The fair value of these derivative ﬁnancialassets and derivative ﬁnancial liabilities as at 31 December 2017 was US$42 million (2016: US$NiI)and US$31 million (2016: US$17.0 million) respectively.

The carrying amounts of each category of financial assets and financial liabilities, as deﬁned in IAS39, are disclosed either in the statement offinancial position or in the notes to the financial statements.
Loans and receivables comprise amounts due from subsidiary companies (Note 32), finance leasereceivables (Note 36), trade receivables (Note 14). other receivables (Note 15), fixed deposits (Note16) and cash and bank balances (Note 17).
As at 31 December 2017, the loans and receivables for the Group and Company were US$340.9milliun (2016: US$569.3 million) and US$967.4 million (2016: US$2,292.4 million) respectively.
Financial liabilities measured at amortised oost comprise trade and other payables (Note 19), loansand borrowings (except as disclosed in Note 21 ). ﬁnance lease payable to subsidiary companies (Note31). liabilities associated with assets held for sale (Note 18). ﬁnance lease payables (Note 22), securitydeposits (Note 24) and other non-current liabilities (Note 27).
As at 31 December 2017, the ﬁnancial liabilities measured at amortised cost tor the Group andCompany were US$9.630.3 million (2016: US$7.648.8 million) and US$6,401,9 million (2016:US$5,217.4 million) respectively.
(a) Financial instruments carried at fair values
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss comprise derivative financialinstruments (Note 13).
The fair values of the derivative ﬁnancial instruments are determined by relerenoe to marked-to-market values provided by counterparties. The fair value measurement of all derivative financialinstruments under the Group are classiﬁed under Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy, for whichinputs other than quoted prices that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (that is,as prices) or indirectly (that is. derived from prices) are included as inputs for the determination offair value.
(b) Financial instruments whose lair values cannot be reliably measured
Amounts due from subsidiary companies are included in this category. The amounts are repayableonly when the cash flows of the subsidiary companies permit. Accordingly, the fair value of theamounts due from subsidiary companies cannot be determined as the timing of the future cashflows cannot be estimated reliably.
(0) Financial instruments whose carrying amounts approximate fail Values
Management has determined that except tor derivative financial instruments, the carrying amountsof its current financial assets and liabilities, based on their notional amounts, reasonablyapproximate their fair values because these are mostly short term in nature or are repricedfrequently.
Non-current loans and borrowings reasonably approximate their fair values as they are floating
rate instruments that are re-priced to market interest rates on or near the end of each year for therespective ﬁnancial year.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The main risks arising from the Group’s ﬁnancial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk, creditrisk and foreign exchange risk. The Group reviews and agrees policies for managing each of iheserisks. The following sections provide details regarding the Group's exposure to ﬁnancial risks and theobjectives, policies and processes ior the management of these risks.
There has been no signiﬁcant change to the Group‘s exposure to these ﬁnancial risks or the mannerin which it manages and measures the risks.
(a) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the fair values or future cash ﬂows of the Group's ﬁnancialinstruments will ﬂuctuate because of changes in market interest rates. The Group’s exposure ininterest rate risk arises primarily from their loans and borrowings, finance lease payable to thirdparties and lease rental income.
The Group obtains ﬁnancing through loans and capital market bonds. The Group’s objective is toobiain the most favourable interest rates available on acceptable terms and conditions.
A significanl porlion oi the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities are based on floating interestrates pegged to US Dollar LIBOR and are contractually repriced at intervals 0! less than 12 months(2016: less than 12 months) from the end of each year. Interest rate exposure arises when theGroup oolleds fixed rate rentals but pays floating interest rate under the borrowings.
The Group‘s policy is to hedge at least 50% oi its mismatched interest rake exposure throughapprupriate interest rate derivative ﬁnancial instruments and burruwing ﬁxed rate debts. At the end0! the year, the Group had hedged approximately 70% (2016: 80%) of the Group's mismatchedinterest rate exposure.

39. Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont‘d)(3) Interest rate risk (cam'd)Sensitivity analysis for interest rate risk
A sensitivity analysis is performed based on the following assumptions on the outstanding financialinstruments of me Group at the end of the year:
(i) Changes in interest rates aﬁeci the interest income or finance expenses of variable interestfinancial instruments which include deposits and floating rate loans.
(ii) Changes in interest rates affect the fair values of derivative ﬁnancial instruments.
(iii) Changes in the lair values of derivative ﬁnancial instruments and other financial assets andliabiliiies are estimated by discounting the future cash flows to net present values usingappropriate market rates prevailing at the end of the year.
For a more meaninglul analysis on the impact oi a change in floating interest rates. the sensitivityanalysis includes the effect of such a change on the lease rental income in order to determine thepotential impact on the Group’s net proﬁt after tax.
Underthese assumptions, an increase 0r decrease in USD floating interest rates of 25 basis points(2016: 25 basis points) with all other variables held constant will have the following effect on theGroup's proﬁt net of tax and the Group's hedging reserve in equity.

Financial risk management objectives and policies (cont'd)(c) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk 01 loss that may arise on outstanding ﬁnancial instruments should acounterparty default on its obligalions.
The Group is exposed to credit risk in the carrying amounts of trade and other receivables, financelease receivables. derivative financial instruments. ﬁxed deposits and cash and bank balancesTypically, the Group's leasing arrangements require lessees to pay rentals in advance and toprovide security deposits and in oen‘ain cases maintenance reserves. However, an earlytermination of a lease due to a credit event may expose the Group to consequential economic lossdue to lower rentals being available from replacement lessees and also possible costs associatedwith repossession, repair and maintenance and transitioning of the aircraft to a new lessee‘
The Group's objective is to seek continual revenue growth while minimising credit losses. TheGroup undertakes credit appraisals on all potential lessees before entering into new leases andreviews the credit status of lessees annually. The Group also reviews the credit standing ofvendors where signiﬁcant and/or long term procurement contracts are being contemplated.
The Group’s policy is to underiake deposit and derivative transactions with reputable financialinstitutions which command an investment grade raling, typically not lower than the equivalent ofS&P Glubal Ratings A-.
(i) Exposure to credit risk
At the end of the year. ihe Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk was represented by:
- the carrying amount of each class of financial assets recognised in the statement ofﬁnancial position, including derivatives with positive fair values; and
— corporate guarantees provided by the Group to the lenders on loans taken up by
subsidiary companies. and also in certain lease agreements entered into by subsidiarycompanies.

(d) Foreign currency risk
The Group has transactional currency exposures mainly arising from its borrowings that aredenominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the Group.
All loans and borrowings which are denominated in Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong KongDollar and Singapore Dollar are swapped into United States Dollar. Foreign currency exposurearises when the Group collects United States Dollar rentals to repay the Australian Dollar, ChineseYuan, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar borrowings. The Group primarily utilises cross-currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge its Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan. Hong Kong
Dollar and Singapore Dollar denominated financial liabilities.
Accordingly, a movement in foreign currency exchange rate is not expected to have a material
impact on the Group's ﬁnancial statements.

BUSINESS ANDFINANCIAL REVIEW
The proportion of both our leases and our debt financing that is contracted on a fixed rate basis rosein 2017, as more ofourairline customers sought fixed rate leases and we reﬂected this ﬁxed rate leasepreference in our funding mix‘ A large proportion of our lease portfolio and corporate debt remainson floating rates, however, and we manage any mismatch between the two through issuance of ﬁxedrate debt and entering into interest rate hedges‘, which limits the impact of interest rate movementson our earnings?

BUSINESS ANDFINANCIAL REVIEW
BUSINESS ENVlRONMENT
Our revenues are derived largely from two sources — [easing aircraft and selling aircraft, typically withleases attached.
Airline demand for leased aircraft is the primary driver of lease rental income. Demand for leasedaircraft by airlines, in turn, is driven by growth in air travel. In 2017, IATA estimates that passengertrafﬁc grew at 7.6%, above the Iong~term average growth rate of 5.0%, with IATA also projectingpassenger traffic growth above average growth rates in 2018. Airline cashflows and profitability werevery strong in 2017, with a record global net profit of US$38.4 billion anticipated for those airlines inIATA. This will be the best earnings performance in the airline sector's history and is expected to beless US-centric than in recent years However, it is important to note that passenger travel demand canbe sensitive to external shocks, through terrorism, pandemic or restrictions on travel or trade flows.We mitigate these risks by maintai ing a young, in-demand portfolio of aircraft and an orderbookcomprising the most popular single-aisle aircraft, and by focusing on our customer selection process.While there are close to 800 airlines in the world] only 150 airlines meet our target customer criteriabut these airlines operate roughly three quarters of the world’s fleet.
Investor demand for leased aircraft is a primary driver of our aircraft sales program and our abilityto generate gains on sale. The availability and cost of ﬁnancing is, in tum, one of the key drivers forinvestor demand for leased aircraft. While interest rates in the second half of 2017 increased, andthere was further upward pressure in early 2018, US Dollar liquidity remains generally available foraircraft investors from a number of sources, including banks and the capital markets. This supportsasset values, and contributes to investor demand for buying our aircraft with leases attached; however,it also puts upward pressure on financing costs and puts greater pressure on lease margins, risks weaddress through our mix of floating-rate and tixed-rate leases and our interest rate hedging policy.External shocks to the ﬁnancial system, or an unexpectedly rapid increase in interest rates, couldadversely affect the cost or availa bility of financing to potential buyers of leased aircraft and thus affectour ability to generate gains on sale.
The aircraft operating lease industry remains highly competitive, with new players entering the marketand many existing lessors expanding. Start-up aircraft operating leasing companies increasinglycompete for PLB transactions where barriers to entry are low] especially in a market environment inwhich debt financing for leased aircraft is available on relatively attractive terms. Under our businessmodel, we build our balance sheet and grow our lease rental income through direct orders from themanufacturers as well as PLB transactions, With strong competition and multiple new entrants, wemay ﬁnd it more difficult to grow our balance sheet and our revenue base by winning PLB transactionsand for the PLB transactions we win, we may ﬁnd that our margins and our returns will come underpressure. However, a competitive environment characterized by high demand for aircraft with leasesattached should also provide good opportunities for selling aircraft.

soc AViATION LIMITED
BUSINESS ANDFINANCIAL REVIEW
Aircraft supply also has an important impact on aircraft values and lease rates. Supply in our addressablemarket, being aircraft with 100 or more seats, has remained relatively stable, in part, this can beattributed to the fact that this market remains effectively an Airbus and Boeing duopoly. In the single-aisle market, Boeing and Airbus are in the early part of the production cycle for new technology aircraftand are increasing production rates. At current production levels, the supply and demand environmentfor single-aisle aircraft remains in good balance] with airline load factors consistently above 80% andhitting a historic high of 81.4% for 2017. It remains to be seen whether the supply chain will be able tosupport all of the planned increases, but corporate guidance from Boeing and Airbus presently pointsto a combined increase in single-aisle production in 2018 of approximately 10%. Oversupply in ourcore market could result in downward pressure on lease rates and aircralt values, which could in turnhave an adverse impact on ourability to grow our lease rental income and put pressure on lease yields.
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY AND PERFORMANCE
BOC Aviation commits to use resources efficiently and reduce unnecessary waste. Our efforts arereflected in our sustainable business model and our electronic communications efforts. While wedo not operate the aircraft that we own and cannot directly control the greenhouse gas emissionsof aircraft operated by our airline customers, our business model centred on a portfolio of newtechnology, fuel efﬁcient aircraft contributes to reductions in carbon emission. In addition, we promotea sustainable environment by using electronic communication (where possible) to distribute corporatecommunications to those of our shareholders who have consented not to receive printed materials.

MANAGEMENTDISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
REVENUES AND OTHER INCOME
Total revenues and other income increased 17.4% to US$1.4 billion from US$12 biilion in 2016,primarily due to an increase in iease rental income as described below.
LEASE RENTAL iNCOME
Our lease rental income increased by 224% to US$1.3 billion as compared with US$1.0 biliion in 2016,The rise in lease rentai income was mainly due to our ﬂeet growth which increased to 286 aircraft(excluding one aircraft subject to ﬁnance lease) compared with 246 aircraft as at 31 December 2016, andto a lesser extent, an increase in rentals from floating rate leases as a result ofthe increase in USD LiBOR.
lNTEREST AND FEE INCOME
Our interest and fee income was US$30 miilion in 2017, down 37.9% from US$48 million in 2016. Thedecline was primariiy due to the reduction in fees from pre-delivery payment transactions.
NET GAIN ON SALE OF AIRCRAFT
Net gain on saie of aircraft decreased by 14.5% to US$78 million in 2017 as compared withUS$91 million in 2016, primarily due to a decrease in number of aircraft sold from 37 in 2016 to 31(including one aircraft leased under a ﬁnance lease) in 2017‘
COSTS AND EXPENSES
The increase in costs and expenses was in line with the increase in total revenues and other income.The increase in depreciation and ﬁnance expenses were correiated with the increase in aircraft assets,
DEPRECiAT/ON OF PLANTAND EQUIPMENT
Depreciation of piant and equipment increased by 21.8% to US$460 million in 2017, up from US$378million in 2016 mainiy due to an increase in aircraft assets, which increased to 286 as at 31 December2017 (excluding one aircraft leased under a ﬁnance lease) from 246 as at 31 December 2016.iMPAIRMENT OF AIRCRAFT
Impairment of aircraft was US$11 miliion in 2017 due to the decline in recoverable amounts of eight
aircraft which were subject to sales contracts, including the remaining ﬁve E190 aircraft (all of whichhave since been sold), compared with the net book vaiues of these aircraft.

MANAGEMENTDISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
FINANCE EXPENSES
Finance expenses increased by 20.4% to US$260 million in 2017 from US$216 miliion in 2016. This wasprimarily due to an increase in our total indebtedness to US$109 billion from US$83 biilion to fund thegrowth of our aircraft ﬂeet and an increase in our average cost of debt. The average cost of debt increasedto 2.8% in 2017 from 2.5% in 2016 as a result of the impact of increased USD LiBOR on our floating ratedebt and an increase in the proportion of fixed rate debt raised in 2017 at higher interest rates.
STAFF COSTS
Staff costs decreased by 3.1% to US$72 million mainly due to iower provision for bonus arising from theimplementation ofa new long term incentive plan, partialiy offset by an increase in salaries and other staffcosts. The lower provision for bonus resulted from a change of the long term incentive plan from a purelycash-based plan, which was fuily provided for in 2016, to a plan comprising cash and share—based elemenls.The cash-based element was fuliy provided for in 2017 but the share-based element under the RSU Planwiil only be accounted for over the vesting period, which is approximately three years commencing in 2018.
OTHER OPERATING COSTS AND EXPENSES
Other operating costs and expenses increased marginally by 0.7% mainly due to an increase in Iocaitaxes incurred by subsidiaries in Tianjin and amortisation of deferred debt issue costs as a result of anincrease in our total indebtedness. The increase was partially offset by lower repossession costs andlower professional fees incurred compared with the prior year.
PROFIT BEFORE iNCOME TAX AND PRE-TAX PROFiT MARGIN
Profit before income tax increased by 16.3% to US$551 million up from US$474 million in 2016. Ourpre-tax proﬁt margin declined to 39.3% in 2017 from 39.7% in 2016, mainly as a resuit ofhigher aircraftdepreciation, higher finance expenses and lower non-rentai income.
iNCOME TAX CREDIT/(EXPENSE)
We recognised an income tax credit of US$36 miilion in 2017 as compared to an income tax expenseof US$56 million in 2016. The income tax credit in 2017 was mainly due to a US$91 million adjustmentin net deferred tax liabilities in our US subsidiary as a result of the enactment of The Tax Cut and JobsAct in the USA in December 2017, which includes a decrease in the federal corporate tax rate in theUSA to 21% from 35% commencing from 2018. Excluding this one-offtax adjustment, the effective taxrate decreased to 10.1% for 2017 from 11.8% in the prior year.
During the year, we were granted the Aircraft Leasing Scheme incentive (the ALS) in Singaporefor an additional five-year period from 1 Juiy 2017. The ALS is an incentive scheme under whichincome derived from qualifying activities is taxed at a concessionary tax rate, rather than the prevailingcorporate tax rate in Singapore of 17%.
PROFIT FOR THE YEAR AND NET PROFIT MARGiN
As a result of the foregoing, our after tax profit for the year increased by 40.3% to US$587 miliion in 2017from US$418 million in 2016. Our net proﬁt margin increased to 41 9% from 35.0% in the prior year.

MANAGEMENTDISCUSSION & ANALYSIS
PLANT AND EQUIPMENT AND ASSETS HELD FOR SALE
We had plant and equipment and assets held for sale of US$15] billion as at 31 December 2017,which increased by 21.9% from US$129 biilion as at 31 December 2016 due to net additions of 40aircraft in 2017 (excluding an aircraft leased under a finance lease). Additions to the aircraft fieet wereachieved through a combination of existing orders, purchase and lease back transactions with ourairline customers and the purchase of leased aircraft.
In plant and equipment and assets held for sale, aircraft constituted the largest component, amountingto US$137 billion and US$107 billion as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectiveiy,representing 87.2% and 83.1% of ourtotal plant and equipment and assets held for saie as at the samedates, respectively. Aircraft pre—delivery payments constituted 12.8% and 16.9% of our total plant andequipment and assets held for sale as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, respectively.
TRADE RECEIVABLES
Included in other assets was an amount of US$55 million of trade receivables, of which US$28 millionis contractually deferred by mutual agreement and interest bearing and US$14 miilion was past duebut not impaired. The past due amount of US$1.4 rniilion has been received in full subsequent to 31December 2017.
CASH AND FIXED DEPOSITS
Our cash and fixed deposits, which were mainly denominated in US Doilar, declined to US$305 millionas at 31 December 2017 from US$558 miliion as at 31 December 2016. This reduction in cash and fixeddeposits was mainly due to the utilisation of such cash and fixed deposits to pay aircraft acquisitioncost as we take delivery of aircraft.
DERiVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Our assets and liabilities with respect to derivative ﬁnancial instruments represent unrealised gainsand losses, respectively, which were recognised in the hedging reserve in equity or profit or loss, onthe cross—currency interest rate swap and interest rate swap contracts that we contracted as at 31December 2017 and 31 December 2016 respectively. Under assets, ourderivative financial instrumentsincreased to US$22 miliion as at 31 December 2017 from US$17 million as at 31 December 2016.Under iiabilities, our derivative ﬁnanciai instruments decreased to US$101 million as at 31 December2017 from US$207 million as at 31 December 2016. The movements in derivative ﬁnancial assets andliabilities are primariiy due to movements in markedetOemarket values of these derivative ﬁnancialinstruments.

Our trade and other payables increased by 148% to US$136}? million as at 31 December 2017compared with US$119.2 m1||ion as at 31 December 2016, primarily due to an increase in deferred staffcompensation and accrued interest expense, partially offset by a reduction of maintenance reservespayable to 1essees.
LOANS AND BORROWINGS AND F1NANCE LEASE PAYABLES
Our loans and borrowings and ﬁnance lease payab1es increased by 26.0% to US$10] billion as at31 December 2017 from US$85 bill10n as at 31 December 2016 to ﬁnance the increase In capitalexpenditure. The increase 1n borrowings 1nc|uded the 1ssuance of US$2 b1l1ion notes under theGlobal Medium Term Note Program and the drawing down of US$672 mimon in term loans andUS$795 m1|lion under revolving cred1t facilities. An amount of US$1.31 billion in borrowings was repaidas part of regular loan repayment or prepaid to manage finance expenses in 2017.
CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Other than corporate guarantees for certa1n loans extended to the Company's subsidiary companiesand for ob|1gations under certain lease agreements entered into by the subs1diary companies as setout In Note 37 to the financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2017, the Company hadno material contingent liabilities as at 31 December 2017.
OTHER INFORMATIONLIQU1D|TY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES
Our primary sources of |1quidity comprise cash generated from aircraft leasing operations, proceedsfrom aircraft sales and borrow1ngs. Our business is capital 1ntensive, requiring signiﬁcant investmentsand borrowings in order to grow and to maintain a young aircraft fleet. The cash flows from ouroperations, particularly our revenues from operating leases of aircraft, have historically prov1ded asignificant portion of the liquidity for these investments.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK MANAGEMENT
Ourtransactionai currency exposures mainly arise from borrowings that are denominated in a currencyother than United States Dollar, our functionai currency.
Ali loans and borrowings that are denominated in Australian Dollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollarand Singapore Doilar are swapped into United States Doilar. To eliminate foreign currency exposurethat may arise, we utilise cross-currency interest rate swap contracts to hedge our exposure in AustralianDollar, Chinese Yuan, Hong Kong Dollar and Singapore Dollar denominated financial liabilities. Suchcontracts are entered with counterparties that are rated at ieast A by S&P Global Ratings. Undertheseagreements, we receive the foreign currency amounts sufficient to meet the obligations in foreigncurrency borrowings and payment of United States Dollar to the counterparties.

In addition, we promote a sustainable erwlronment by using electronic communicatlon (wherepossible) to distribute corporate communications to our shareholders who have consented not toreceive printed materials. We have used electronic communlcation for all interim and annual reportsand all other shareholder communications since the Listing Date. In addition to saving costs, reducingwaste of resources and increasing efﬁciency, the implementatlon of Eecommunication is also a way tosupport the environment by reducing deforestation and carbon emissions. We intend to continue ourelectronic communication in the future. Our staff also use video conferencing facilities regularly toavoid unnecessary travel.
Our most important strategy for promoting a sustainable environment is to build a ﬂeet of the mostfuel-efﬁcient alrcraft. We also emphasize responsible resource-consumptlon. Our staff is primarllybased in Singapore and operates from rented office space where most resource consumption is so lowit is not tracked as part of our rental agreements. Data that we can monitor and control includes powerand paper consumption, both of which eased in 2017 having increased the prior year largely due tomuch higher administrative activities in relation to our IPO.

Key Audit Matters (continued)
Carrying value of plant and equipment - aircraft
The carrying value of plant and equipment — aircraft was signiﬁcant to the audit because aircraft carrying value(including aircraft classified as held for sale) of US$13,667 million as at the end of the reporting period wasmaterial to the financial statements, representing over 85% of the Group's total assets. During the year ended31 December 2017. the Group recognised an impairment loss of US$105 million on aircraft and aircraft heldfor sale. The impairment loss represents the write—down of the aircraft book value to their estimated recoverableamount.
As disclosed in Note 3.1(a) to the ﬁnancial statementsI the Group follows the guidance provided by IAS 36Impairment of Assets in determining whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss on an aircraftManagement exercises significant judgment in determining whether there is any indication that any aircraftmay have been impaired. This exercise involves management to consider both internal and external sourcesof information which include but are not limited to: observable indications that the value of aircraft has declinedduring the period significantly mare than would be expected as a result of the passage of time or normal use;significant adverse changes in the expected usage of the aircraft, technological or aviation environment thathave taken place or will take place in the near future; signiﬁcant increase in market interest rates; evidence ofobsolescence or physical damage of the aircralt; and worse than expected economic performance ot theaircraft, We reviewed management's assessment of whether indicators of impairment were present andassessed the reasonableness of significant judgments used in this review.
In addition. our audit procedures included. amongst others:
0 Validating the intormation used in assessing the financial proﬁtability of individual aircratt by comparinglease rental rates to depreciation and costs of ﬁnancing for that aircraft;
. Validating the utilisation of aircraft;
- Assessing management's judgment on economic and technological relevance of aircraft and enginemodels in the cun'ent aviation demand and supply dynamics:
0 Evaluating the competence and objectivity of the experts employed in the Group’s methodology toassess whether the value of aircraft has declined significantly; and
. Performing sensitivity analyses on aircraftwhich were not identified as having indicators of impairmentbut have a higher risk of impairment due to lower excess when compared to their fair values, higherage of aircraft or the existence of operational circumstances.
Furthermore. we assessed the adequacy ofthe Group’s disclosures regarding the impairment of aircraft. whichare disclosed in Notes 3,1 and 12 to the financial statements.

Auditor‘s Responsi ities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial statements as a whole are freefrom material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor‘s report that includes ouropinion.
