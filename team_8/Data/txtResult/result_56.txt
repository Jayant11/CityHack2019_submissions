Dividends
Following a strategic review of the Group’s financialprospects for the coming financial years and taking intoconsideration the Group’s historical performance and pastdividends paid, we announced the revision of our dividendpolicy for FY2017 to FY2019. The Company will distributeannual dividends, of not less than 40% of its consolidatednet proﬁt, excluding non-recurring, one-off and exceptionalitems as stated in the audited financial statements of theyear.
The increase of the Company’s payout ratio underscoresour commitment to maximise shareholders’ returns whichhas always been our key priority. For FY2017, we arepleased to propose a final one—tier tax-exempt dividendof 2.6 cents per ordinary share. Including an interimone-tier tax-exempt dividend of 1.5 cents per share, totaldividend payout ratio for FY2017 represents 40.5% of theGroup’s net profit. This brings the total dividends paidout for FY2017 to S$22.6 million, a 78.1% increment fromFY2016’s quantum.
Looking beyond Taiwan and other markets, the Group’skey focus on China holds immense long-term potential.China is the world’s second largest Cosmetics and PersonalCare market with revenue amounting to US$363 billionl,of which the “Skincare” market is the largest, contributingUS$130 billion in revenue. This market is expected togrow steadily at a CAGR of 6.8% from 2017 to 2021 and isa sizeable market for the Group as we focus on gaining astronger foothold in the next three to five years.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed,or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returnsthrough its power over the investee.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less anyimpairment losses.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If anyindication exists, or When an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate ofthe asset’s recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposaland its value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂows thatare largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset orcash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to itsrecoverable amount.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used todetermine the asset’s recoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, thecarrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carryingamount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognisedpreviously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial instruments(a) Financial assets
initial recognition and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractualprovisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets atinitial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financialassets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurementThe subsequent measurement of financial assets depends on their classification as follows:
(i) Loans and receivables
Non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an activemarket are classified as loans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivablesare measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and lossesare recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, andthrough the amortisation process.

Financial assets (cont'd)Subsequent measurement (cont'd)
(ii) Financial assets urefuir value through proﬁt or loss including ﬁnancial assets held for trading
Financial assets at fair value through profit of loss include financial assets held for trading. Financialassets are classified as held for trading if they are acquired for the purpose of selling or repurchasingin the near term. This category includes derivatives financial instruments entered into by the Group.
Subsequent to initial recognition, financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured atfair value. Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of the financial assets are recognisedin profit or loss. Net gains or net losses on financial assets at fair value through profit or loss includeexchange differences, interest and dividend income.
(iii) Held-to-maturityinvestments
Non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments and fixed maturity are classified
as held-to—maturity when the Group has the positive intention and ability to hold the investment tomaturity. Subsequent to initial recognition, held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortisedcost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit orloss when the held-to-maturity investments are derecognised or impaired, and through theamortisation process.
De-recognition
A financial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash ﬂows from the asset hasexpired. On de»recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amountand the sum of the consideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised inother comprehensive income is recognised in proﬁt or loss.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractualprovisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities atinitial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fairvalue through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value through profit or loss aresubsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. Gains and losses arerecognised in profit or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through the amortisation process.
De-recognition
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled orexpires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantiallydifferent terms, or the terms of an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or

modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability and the recognition of a new liability,and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.
2.13 Impairment of financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a ﬁnancial asset is impaired.
(21)
(b)
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidence ofimpairment exists individually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively forfinancial assets that are not individually significant. If the Group determines that no objective evidenceof impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whether significant or not, it includes theasset in a group of financial assets With similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assesses them forimpairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, orcontinues to be recognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has beenincurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and
the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interestrate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is the currenteffective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account.The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial assets is reduced directlyor if an amount was charged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowance account arewritten off against the carrying value of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has beenincurred, the Group considers factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financialdifficulties of the debtor and default or significant delay in payments.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be relatedobjectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognisedimpairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset does not exceed its amortisedcost at the reversal date. The amount of reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Financial assets carried at cost
If there is objective evidence (such as signiﬁcant adverse changes in the business environment where theissuer operates, probability of insolvency or signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difficulties of the issuer) that an impairmentloss on financial assets carried at cost had been incurred, the amount of the loss is measured as thedifference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂowsdiscounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. Such impairment losses are notreversed in subsequent periods.

2.14 Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and short-term, highly liquidinvestments that are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk ofchanges in value. These also include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group’s cash management.
2.15 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing the inventories totheir present location and condition are accounted for as follows:
— Raw materials: purchase costs on a weighted average cost basis;— Finished goods and work-in-progress: costs of direct materials and labour and a proportion of
manufacturing overheads based on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a weightedaverage cost basis.
Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying Valueof inventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs ofcompletion and the estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
2.16 Provisions
General
Provisions are recognised When the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a pastevent, it is probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle theobligation and the amount of the obligation can be estimated reliably,
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reﬂect the current best estimate.
If it is no longer probable that an outﬂow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, theprovision is reversed. If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using acurrent pre-tax rate that reﬂects, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used,the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance cost,
Provision for restoration costs
Provision for restoration cost arose from the estimated cost of dismantling, removing and restoring the leaseholdproperties at the end of their lease terms.
The restoration costs which are provided at the present value of estimated costs required to settle the obligationare recognised as part of the cost of that particular asset. The estimated future cost if restoration is reviewedannually and adjusted as appropriate.
2.17 Financialguarantees
104
A financial guarantee contract is a contract that requires the issuer to make specified payments to reimburse theholder for a loss it incurs because a specified debtor fails to make payment when due in accordance with theterms of a debt instrument.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Financial guarantees (cont‘d)
Financial guarantees are recognised initially as a liability at fair value, adjusted for transaction costs that aredirectly attributable to the issuance of the guarantee. Subsequent to initial recognition, financial guarantees arerecognised as income in profit or loss over the period of the guarantee. If it is probable that the liability will
be higher than the amount initially recognised less amortisation, the liability is recorded at the higher amountwith the difference charged to profit or loss.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to theacquisition, construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when theactivities to prepare the asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costsare incurred. Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets are substantially completed for their intended useor sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest andother costs that an entity incurs in connection With the borrowing of funds.
Employee benefits
Deﬁned contribution plans
The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it hasoperations. In particular, the Singapore companies in the Group make contributions to the Central ProvidentFund scheme in Singapore, a defined contribution pension scheme. Contributions to defined contributionpension schemes are recognised as an expense in the period in Which the related service is performed.
2.20 Leases
(a) As lessee
Finance leases Which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownershipof the leased item, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or,
if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to theamount capitalised. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of thelease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Financecharges are charged to profit or loss. Contingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the periods inwhich they are incurred.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and thelease term, if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the leaseterm,
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over thelease term. The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rentalexpense over the lease term on a straight-line basis.
(b) As lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of theasset are classified as operating leases. Initial direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease areadded to the carrying amount of the leased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases asrental income. The accounting policy for rental income is set out in Note 221(0).

Deferred tax (cont'd)Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:
— Where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liabilityin a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neitherthe accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss; and
~ In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries where thetiming of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that thetemporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences, the carry forward of unusedtax credits and unused tax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available againstwhich the deductible temporary differences, and the carry forward of unused tax credits and unused taxlosses can be utilised except:
— Where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initialrecognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the timeof the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit not taxable profit or loss; and
— In respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, deferredtax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differences will
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profit Will be available against which the temporarydifferences can be utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced tothe extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part ofthe deferred tax asset to be utilised‘
Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised t0the extent that it has become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to berecovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year Whenthe asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted 0rsubstantively enacted at the end of each reporting period.
Deferred tax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss.

A contingent liability is:
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by theoccurrence 0r non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of theGroup; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:
(i) It is not probable that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settlethe obligation; or
(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by theoccurrence 0r non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingentliabilities assumed in a business combination that are present obligations and which the fair values can be reliablydetermined.
Significant accounting judgments and estimates
The preparation of the Group’s consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgments,estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and
the disclosure of contingent liabilities at the end of each reporting period. Uncertainty about these assumptionsand estimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset orliability affected in the future periods.
Management is of the opinion that there is no signiﬁcant judgment made in applying accounting policies thathave a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within thenext financial period.
Key sources of estimation uncertaintyThe key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the
reporting period are discussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters availablewhen the ﬁnancial statements were prepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments,

however, may change due to market changes or circumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Suchchanges are reﬂected in the assumptions when they occur.
(a) Estimation afnet realisable valuefor inventoriesA review is made periodically in identifying end-of—life or slow-rnoving inventories and make estimates ofwrite down required. The review requires management to consider the future demand for the products.In any case the realisable value represents the best estimate of the recoverable amount and is basedon the acceptable evidence available at the end of the reporting period and inherently involves estimatesregarding the future expected realisable value. The usual considerations for determining the amount ofallowance or write-down include ageing analysis and subsequent events. In general, such an evaluationprocess requires significant judgement and materially affects the carrying amount of inventories at the endof the reporting period. Possible changes in these estimates could result in revisions to the stated value ofthe inventories. The carrying amount of inventories is disclosed in the Note 19 on inventories.(b) Impairment ofgoodwill and licenses of Best World (China) Pharmaceutical C0., LtdGoodwill allocated to Best World (China) Pharmaceutical C0., Ltd.

Upon full conversion, the Group is expected to record higherrevenue and gross profit as a result of revenue recognition at aprice higher than export price, offset by an increase in operatingexpenses mainly attributable to management and staff costs thatsupport the market in China‘ There will also be a decline in OtherOperating Income due to lower service fees that the Group willbe receiving from its export agent.
The China market is not new to us, We are backed by provenresults, achieved by strategies which have been refined over theyears. While we are heartened with our achievements thus far,we also believe that this is only the beginning of a new growthera, with China set to be our fastest growing market for at
least the next three to five years and we are confident of ourexecution abilities to navigate this market of immense potential.

Imgairment testing of goodwill
The recoverable amount of the BWC CGU has been determined based on value in use calculation using cashﬂow projections from financial budgets approved by management covering a five-year period The pre—taxdiscount rate applied to the cash ﬂow projections and the forecasted growth rates used to extrapolate cash ﬂowprojections beyond the five-year period are as follows:
Discount rate 16.50% 16.40%Terminal growth rate 3% 3%
Key assumptions used in the value-in-use calculationThe calculation ofvalue-in—use for the CGU is most sensitive to the following assumptions:
- Budgeted gross margin — Gross margin is based on average values achieved in the three years preceding thestart of the budget period.
- Budgeted sales growth rate and terminal growth rate 7 The forecasted growth rate is based on industrygrowth forecasts and not exceeding the average long-term growth rate for the relevant markets of the CGUs.
- Pre»tax discount rate — discount rate represents the current market assessment of the risks specific to eachCGU, regarding the time value of money and individual risks of the underlying assets which have notbeen incorporated in the cash ﬂow estimates. The discount rate calculation is based on the specificcircumstances of the Group and its operating segments and derived from its weighted average cost ofcapital (WACC). The WACC takes into account both debt and equity. The cost of equity is derived fromthe expected return on investment by the Group’s investors. The cost of debt is based on the interestbearing borrowings the Group is obliged to service. Segment—specific risk is incorporated by applyingindividual beta factors. The beta factors are evaluated annually based on publicly available market data.
Sensitivity to changes in assumptions
Management believes that any reasonable possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverableamount is based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

(ii) Obligations under finance leases
The fair value is estimated by discounting expected future cash ﬂows at market incremental lendingrate for similar types of lending and leasing arrangements at the balance sheet date.
Fair value of financial instruments whose carrying amounts approximate their fair values
Management has determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and otherreceivables, amounts due from/(to) subsidiaries (current portion), trade and other payables and otherfinancial liabilities, based on their notional amounts, reasonably approximate their fair values becausethese are mostly shon term in nature or are reprieed frequently.
Financial instruments whose fair values cannot be reliably measured
Loans receivables from subsidiaries (Note 17) do not have fixed repayment terms and are repayable onlywhen the cash ﬂows of the borrowers permit. Accordingly, the fair values of these amounts are notdeterminable with reasonable certainty as the timing of the future cash ﬂows arising from the amounts cannot beestimated reliably.

Financial risk management objectives and policies
The Group and the Company are exposed to ﬁnancial risks arising from its operations and the use of financialinstruments. The key financial risks include credit risk, liquidity risk, interest rate risk, foreign currency risk and marketprice risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees policies and procedures for the management of these risks. TheAudit Committee provides independent oversight t0 the effectiveness of the risk management process. It is, and hasbeen, throughout the current and previous financial year, the Group’s policy that no trading in derivatives forspeculative purposes shall be undertaken. Guidelines set up the short and long term objectives and actions to be takenin order to manage the financial risks. Such guidelines include:
Minimise interest rate, currency, credit and market risk for all kinds of transactions;
Maximise the use of “natural hedge”, favouring as much as possible the natural off—setting of sales and costs andpayables and receivables denominated in the same currency and therefore put in place hedging strategies only forthe excess balance. The same strategy is pulsued with regard to interest rate risk;
All financial risk management activities are carried out and monitored by senior management staff;All financial risk management activities are carried out following good market practices;
When appropriate consideration is given to entering into derivatives or any other similar instruments solely forhedging purposes.
The following sections provide details regarding the Group's and Company's exposure to the above-mentioned financialrisks and the objectives, policies and processes for the management of these risks.
(a)
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of loss that may arise on outstanding financial instruments should a counterparty defaulton its obligations.

Capital management
Capital includes debt and equity items.
The Group manages its capital structure and makes adjustments to it, in light of changes in economic conditions.
To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capitalto shareholders or issue new shares. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the financialyear ended 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.
In order to maintain its listing On the Singapore Stock Exchange, the Company has to have share capital with at leasta free ﬂoat of 10% 0f the shares. The Company met the capital requirement on its initial listing and the rules limitingtreasury share purchases mean it will automatically continue to satisfy that requirement, as it did throughout thefinancial year. Management receives a report from the registrars frequently on substantial share interests showing thenon-free ﬂoat and it demonstrated continuing compliance with the 10% limit throughout the financial year.
Management does not set a target level of gearing but uses capital opportunistically to support its business and to addvalue for shareholders. The key discipline adopted is to widen the margin between the return on capital employed andthe cost of that capital.
As at 31 December 2017, as disclosed in Note 24, the Company has bank borrowing of $2,674,000 (2016: $Nil). TheGroup has bank borrowings and finance leases totaling to $7,398,000 as at 31 December 2017 (2016: $7,361,000) andthese are secured by speciﬁc assets. As such, the debt-to adjusted capital ratio may not provide a meaningful indicatorof the risk from borrowings.

BOARD COMPOSITION AND GUIDANCE
Principle 2
There should be a strong and independent element on the Board, Which is able to exercise objectivejudgment oncorporate affairs independently, in particular, from Management and 10% shareholders. No individual or small group ofindividuals should be allowed to dominate the Board’s decision making.
The Board comprises six directors of whom three are independent non-executive directors and three are executivedirectors. The Company maintains a strong and independent element on the Board with the independent directorsconstituting half of the Board. The independent directors have confirmed that they do not have any relationship with theCompany or its related companies or its 10% shareholders or its officers that could interfere, or be reasonably perceivedto interfere, with the exercise of the director’s independent business judgment with a View to the best interests of theCompany, and they are able to exercise objective judgment on corporate affairs independently from the Managementand its 10% shareholders.
As half of the Board is independent, the Board and the NC are satisfied that the Board has substantial independentelements to ensure that objective judgment is exercised on corporate affairs.
The independence of each director is reviewed annually by the NC and its views made to the Board. Particular scrutinywas applied in assessing the continued independence of Mr Lee Sen Choon; having served as a director beyond nineyears from the date of his first appointment, with attention to ensure that his allegiance remains clearly aligned withshareholders’ interest. Mr Lee Sen Choon duly recused himself from the discussion and decision in respect of his ownindependence.
The following were some of the factors considered in reviewing the independence of the director who has served beyondnine years:
(a) whether the director is free from any dealings, relationships or circumstances that could affect or appear to affecthis independent judgement, particularly with regards to whether the director has indicated or demonstratedan alignment or ongoing support for any specific group of stakeholders, instead of representing the interests of allstakeholders;
(b) whether the length of service has had any adverse impact on the director’s objectivity and judgement and whetherduring the tenure there has been any impairment to his ability to discharge his duties and responsibilities in theoverall interest of the Group, taking into consideration the interests of all stakeholders; and
(0) whether the director continues to exhibit a firm commitment to his role and continues to actively contribute withthe knowledge and experience of the Group’s business built up over the years.
After due consideration and with the concurrence of the NC, the Board is of the view that Mr Lee Sen Choon
has demonstrated strong independence of character and judgment over the years in discharging his duties andresponsibilities as independent director and he does not have any existing business and/or professional relationshipwhatsoever with Best World group of companies and its officers who could possibly inﬂuence his objectivity indischarging his duty as an independent director of the Company
Taking into account the above, the Board has determined that Mr Lee Sen Choon continues to be consideredindependent, notwithstanding he has served on the Board for more than nine years from the date of his firstappointment. The independent directors continue to be committed to carry out their roles and responsibilities, ensuringthat the strategies proposed by the Management are constructively challenged, fully discussed and examined, taking intoaccount the long term interests of the Company’s stakeholders. which include shareholders, employees, customers andsuppliers.
46
===================================================
46.hocr: 
The Board also reviewed the performance of each independent director and considers each of these directors bringsinvaluable expertise, experience and knowledge to the Board and they continue to contribute positively to the Boardand Board Committees. Therefore, the Board is satisfied as to the performance and continued independence ofjudgment of each of these directors.
The NC reviews the size of the Board on an annual basis. Based on the latest review, there was general agreementthat the present Board size is appropriate and facilitates effective decision making, taking into account the nature andcurrent scope of the Company’s operations and the requirements of the business.
The Board and NC appreciate the benefits of having a diverse Board. The diversity in our Board’s composition, anappropriate mix of gender, expertise and experience in areas such as accounting and finance, business and managementexperience, industry knowledge, strategic planning experience, customer-based experience and knowledge allows Boardmembers to have broader perspectives, better identify possible risks, raise challenging questions and contribute toproblem-solving, leading to quality decision making in order to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives. Details ofthe Board members’ qualifications and experience are presented in this Annual Report under the section titled “Boardof Directors”.
Whilst all the directors share an equal responsibility for the Company’s operations, the role of the independent non-executive directors is crucial in helping to develop proposals on Company strategies and to ensure that the strategiesproposed by the Management are constructively challenged. The independent non-executive directors are alsoresponsible for reviewing the performance of the Management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitoringthe reporting of performance.
To facilitate a more effective check on Management, the independent directors, led by the lead independent director,meet at least once a year without the presence of Management.
CHAIRMAN AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE OFFICER
Principle 3
There should be a clear division oftesponsibilities between the leadership of the Board and the executives responsiblefor managing the company’s business. No one individual should represent a considerable concentration ofpower.
Where the Chairman and CEO is the same person, the independent directors should make up at least half of theBoard. The Company has complied With the relevant guideline of the Code as half of the Board is made up ofindependent directors.
The Chairman’s duties and responsibilities include:
is leading the Board to effectively cover all aspects of its role;
ii. reviewing the agenda and the board papers prepared for Board meetings to ensure significant items,particularly strategic issues are looked into and sufficient time is allocated for their discussion;
iiii setting an open and honest culture and encouraging debate;iv. ensuring the directors receive board papers that are complete, adequate and timely before the meeting;
V. ensuring the proper conduct of meetings and accurate documentation of the proceedings with the help of thethe corporate secretary;

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
vi. ensuring effective communication with shareholders;
vii. encourage constructive relations within the Board and between the Board and Management and facilitatingeffective contribution from the independent directors.
viii. promoting high standards of corporate governance.
In addition to the above duties, the Chairman will assume other duties and responsibilities as may be required fromtime to time.
T0 efficiently run the Board, the Company has two directors, Dr Doreen Tan Nee Moi and Dr Dora Hoan BengMui designated as Co-Chairman on top of their existing duties as President and Group CEO / Managing Directorrespectively.
As the Company’s operations span across many countries, both Dr Doreen Tan Nee Moi and Dr Dora Hoan Beng Muiare required to travel frequently for business. Hence, it would be desirable to have Co—Chairman so either one couldchair the Board or General Meeting in the absence of the other.
Dr Dora Hoan Beng Mui, the Group CEO / Managing Director of the Company is one of the founders and asubstantial shareholder of the Company. She has been personally involved in the day-to-day operations of the Companysince its incorporation, providing the Group with vision and strong leadership and playing an instrumental role indeveloping the businesses of the Group. Her performance and remuneration are reviewed periodically by the NC andthe RC respectively, which consists mainly of independent directors.
As major decisions in the Group are reviewed by the Board, which has a strong representation of independent non-executive directors, the Board believes that there are adequate safeguards in place against having a concentration ofpower and authority in a single individual.
Shareholders with concerns may contact the Lead Independent Director - Mr Lee Sen Choon directly, when contact
through the normal channels Via the Co-Chairman, the Executive Directors and the Senior Group Financial Controllerhas failed to provide a satisfactory resolution or when such contact is inappropriate.
BOARD MEMBERSHIP
Principle 4There should be a formal and transparent process for the appointment and reappointment ofdirectors to the Board.

The duties of the NC are as follows:
a) To make recommendations to the Board on all board appointments;b) To re-norninate directors with regards to their contribution and performance;C) To determine annually whether a director is independent;

e) To assess the effectiveness of the Board as a whole and decide if each director has been adequately carrying outhis or her duties
The NC reviews annually the independence declarations made by the Company’s independent non-executive directorsbased on the criterion of independence under the guidelines provided in the Code. For the year under review, the NChas ascertained the independence status of the three independent non-executive directors of the Company, namely MrLee Sen Choon, Mr Chan Soo Sen and Mr Adrian Chan Pengee by virtue of the fact that each of them does not haveany existing business and/or professional relationship whatsoever with Best World group of companies and its officerswhich could possibly inﬂuence their objectivity in discharging their duty as an independent director of the Company.
The Board, having considered their character, their in-depth knowledge of the Group’s business operations, past andcontinuous contributions at Board level in terms of impartial and constructive advice, is of the view that there is nomaterial conﬂict between their tenure and their ability to discharge their role as independent non»executive directors.
The NC adopted internal guidelines addressing competing time commitments that are faced when directors serve onmultiple boards. The Board has determined that directors should not concurrently hold more than six listed companyboard representations.
The NC monitors and determines annually whether directors who have multiple board representations and otherprincipal commitments, give sufficient time and attention to the affairs of the Company and adequately carry out his orher duties as a director of the Company. The NC takes into account the results of the assessment of the effectiveness ofthe individual director and his actual conduct on the Board, in making this determination.
The NC was satisfied that in FY2017, directors with other listed company board representations and / or other principalcommitments were able to carry out and had been adequately carrying out, their duties as directors of the Company.
In the selection process for the appointment of new directors, the NC reviews the composition of the Board andidentifies the skill sets which will enhance the Board’s overall effectiveness. Potential candidates are identified fromvarious sources. Thereafter, the NC conducts an initial assessment to review a candidate’s qualifications, attributes andpast experience followed by interviewing short-listed candidates. The proposed candidates' independence, expertise,background and skills sets will be considered before the NC makes its recommendations to the Board.
In line with the Board’s considerations for progressive renewal, we have recently appointed a new independent non-executive director, Mr Adrian Chan Pengee. In addition to being extremely prominent in the legal field, Adrian is
the legal adviser to the Direct Selling Association of Singapore (DSAS) and is very familiar with our industry and itsregulations. He was also appointed as a Code Administrator to DSAS, responsible for interpreting the provisions of the

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
The ERM committee, comprising the Executive Director and Chief Operating Officer — Mr Huang Ban Chin,department heads and chaired by the Lead Independent Director — Mr Lee Sen Choon assists the Board on riskmanagement. The key components of the Company’s risk management framework include:
Risks assessment — Risks that the Company is exposed to are identified, assessed and updated in the risk register.The risks are rated and ranked according to the likelihood and its impact. Top risks are highlighted for extra emphasis.
Risks monitoring — Risks are monitored through internal audits, internal reviews, questionnaires circulated tosubsidiary management and the control self—assessment (“CSA”) programme.
Risks response & risks reporting ~ The ERM committee holds regular meetings to discuss risk issues, new initiativesand reports material findings uncovered from risk monitoring. These meetings are thoroughly minuted and form partof the Board papers presented to the Board. Key risks exposures and statuses are also compiled in a risk reportingsummary and submitted for Board review)
The top 5 risks the company faces are identified below:
1) Disruption in supplyOur head office supplies the regional centers with inventory. A forecast is prepared by the regional center toenable head office to determine how much should be ordered from the supplier. As these forecasts are based onestimates, the regional centers risk facing stock shortage when sales exceed their forecast. On the other hand,
ordering too much results in higher storage costs and stock obsolescence. We regularly review sales forecasts,monitor custom regulations, maintain buffer stocks and work with our suppliers to minimize disruptions.
2) Sudden discontinuation of key product
Although BWI has a wide range of products, a few products within the range form the major part of revenue.For example, Plum Delite and some products in the DR Secret range of skin care products are huge generatorsof revenue. Discontinuation of products can arise because of restrictions of certain product ingredients imposedby the authorities. These changes in regulations are not controllable by BWI and unfavorable changes can occurdespite having met initial requirements‘ The product development team keeps track of regulatory requirementsof the countries that the company operates in and consistently seeks to enlarge the product range to reducereliance on any single product.
3) Advertisements that over promise product efficacy
Distributors sometimes exaggerate the uses of our products, leading to regulatory intervention. Warnings orpenalties might be issued to the company, causing reputation damage or monetary losses, affecting ourprofitability. The company only publishes product attributes that can be supported for each product on ourwebsite. Through trainings and interactions, we also remind our distributors not to over exaggerate about theproduct’s efficacy and keep to the proven functions.
4) Changes in industry licensing requirements
Direct selling activities are usually subject to special licensing requirements in many countries. Any changes inregulations could result in termination or restriction of activities at our lifestyle centres. The impact of suchan event is significant although it is not assessed to be likely. The continued operation of our manufacturingfacility in BWZ is currently dependent on our facility being GMP compliant. Should there be any changes inrequirements to the standards, the company might have to incur additional costs to fulfil the authority’srequirements. We monitor Changes closely to ensure that we remain compliant.

5) Unfavorable foreign exchange movements
As the Group operates internationally, revenue is generated in various currencies. Although subsidiaries arerequired to remit excess cash, the company still has foreign currency exposure should local currency ﬂuctuatesignificantly against the Singapore dollar. BWI monitors monetary policy changes, major currency exposures andattempt to fix rates where feasible to minimize unfavorable exchange rate ﬂuctuations.
The CSA programme established since 2011 provides a framework to obtain feedback on the state of internal controls.The programme requires subsidiaries to review and report annually on the effectiveness of controls and the controlenvironment to HQ and significant findings are reported to the Board. Periodically, internal audit and independentreviews would be conducted to validate the self—assessments.
The Company has in place a whistle—blowing policy to empower employees with avenues to report suspected fraud,corruption, dishonest practices and other acts of misconduct. The Company will follow up on all reports and treatall information received confidentially to protect the identity (if available) and the interest of all whistle—blowers.For incidents of severe nature, the AC will be informed and an independent team reporting directly to the AC willbe established accordingly.

Report on the Audit of the Financial StatementsOpinion
We have audited the financial statements of Best World International Limited (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries(collectively, the “Group”), which comprise the statements of financial position of the Group and the Company as at 31December 2017, the statements of changes in equity of the Group and the Company and the consolidated statement ofprofit or loss, consolidated statement of comprehensive income and consolidated statement of cash ﬂows of the Groupfor the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including a summary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group, the statement of financial positionand the statement of changes in equity of the Company are properly drawn up in accordance with the provisions ofthe Companies Act, Chapter 50 (the Act) and Financial Reporting Standards in Singapore (FRSs) so as to give a trueand fair view of the consolidated financial position of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31December 2017 and 0f the consolidated financial performance, consolidated Changes in equity and consolidated cashﬂows of the Group and changes in equity of the Company for the year ended on that date.
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Singapore Standards on Auditing (SSAS). Our responsibilities under thosestandards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements section ofour report. We are independent of the Group in accordance With the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority(ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code)together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of the financial statements in Singapore, and wehave fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believethat the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of thefinancial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financialstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.For each matter below, our description of how our audit addresses the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the FinancialStatements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included theperformance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of material misstatement 0f the financialstatements. The results of our audit procedures, including the procedures performed to address the matters below,provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
(a) Impairment assessment of goodwill and licenses of Best World (China) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd.
As at 31 December 2017, goodwill allocated to Best World (China) Pharmaceutical Co., Ltd. (“Best World(China)”) was $686,000 and the intangible assets relating to licences of Best World (China) was $3,367,000.The recoverable amount of Best World (China), which is also a cash-generating unit (“CGU”) for thepurpose of impairment testing, has been determined based on value-in-use calculations using the CGU’sexpected future cash ﬂows. The audit procedures over management’s impairment test were significant to ouraudit because the assessment process is complex and are based on assumptions that are affected by expectedfuture market and economic conditions. As such, we determined this to be a key audit matter.
81
===================================================
81.hocr: 

Key Audit Matters (cont'd)
As part of our audit procedures, we obtained an understanding of management’s impairment assessmentprocess. We reviewed the robustness of management’s budgeting process by comparing the actual ﬁnancialresults against previous projections. We assessed the valuation method used by management and evaluatedthe key assumptions used in the impairment analysis, in particular the discount rates, budgeted sales growthrates, budgeted gross margins and terminal values. We involved our internal valuation specialists to assistus in evaluating the reasonableness of discount rates used. We evaluated the reasonableness of budgetedsales growth rates, budgeted gross margins and terminal growth rates by comparing them to historicalresults as well as considering the viability of future plans and industry outlook. We reviewed management’sanalysis of the sensitivity of the value-in-use calculation to changes in the key assumptions. We also assessedthe adequacy of the disclosures related to the goodwill and licenses of the CGU in Note 15A and Note 15Bto the financial statements.
(b) Inventories write-down
The Group’s total inventories net of write-down to net realisable value (“NRV”) amounted to $28,194,000as at 31 December 2017. The determination of inventories write down to NRV requires management toexercise judgement in identifying end-of—life or slow-moving inventories and make estimates of write downrequired. Such estimation is made after taking into consideration factors such as future demands andanticipated selling prices. As such, we determined this to be a key audit matter.
As part of our audit procedures, we evaluated management’s process in identifying and estimating the writedown required for end-of—life or slow-moving inventories. We discussed the basis of the write down Withmanagement and checked to historical sale patterns to assess reasonableness of the percentages used inestimation of write down of inventories. We checked, on a sampling basis, that the Group has made thewrite down of inventories in accordance with the Group’s policy. For inventories with expiry date, we testedthe accuracy of the inventories ageing report. We selected samples of inventories and tested that they werestated at the lower of cost and NRV by verifying to subsequent year-end sales price of the inventories. We alsoassessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to inventories in Note 19 to the financial statements.
Other Matter
The financial statements of Best World International Limited and its subsidiaries for the year ended 31 December 2016were audited by another auditor who expressed an unmodified opinion on those statements on 24 March 2017.
Other Information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in theannual report, but does not include the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form ofassurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doingso, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledgeobtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If, based on the work we have performed, weconclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We havenothing to report in this regard.

Responsi ties of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance withthe provisions of the Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficientto provide a reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; andtransactions are properly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fairfinancial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue asa going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis ofaccounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realisticalternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free frommaterial misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion.Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance WithSSAs will always detect a material misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and areconsidered material if, individually or in the aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of these financial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
0 Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement 0f the ﬁnancial statements, whether due to fraud orerror, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficientand appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resultingfrom fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentionalomissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
0 Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that areappropriate in the Circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of theGroup’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates andrelated disclosures made by management.
' Conclude 0n the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on theaudit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may castsignificant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertaintyexists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statementsor, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our Opinion Our conclusions are based on the audit evidenceobtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group tocease to continue as a going concern.
' Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including the disclosures,and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achievesfair presentation.
0 Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or businessactivities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements. We are responsiblefor the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remain solely responsible for our auditopinion.

Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements (cont‘d)
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit andsignificant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regardingindependence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that may reasonably be thought tobear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most significance inthe audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters. We describethese matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when,in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should not be communicated in our report becausethe adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the public interest benefits of suchcommunication.
Report on Other Legal and Regulatory Requirements
In our opinion, the accounting and other records required by the Act to be kept by the Company and by thosesubsidiary corporations incorporated in Singapore of which we are the auditors have been properly kept in accordancewith the provisions of the Act.

and Business Overview
On the back of an extended periodof growth, with sales growing at60.8% CAGR between FY2009
to FY2016, our Taiwan market,recorded a 28.5% decline in FY2017as compared With FY2016 due tochanges in strategies implementedsince the beginning of FY2017.
Management has adopted thesenew strategies to ensure sustainablegrowth in the longer term. Strategiescurrently put in place includeadopting a dual focus on consumersand distributors to improve sales permember through digitalisation and
10
better customer service, as opposed to just increase new members, furthercultivate existing networks in stronghold areas in Central and SouthernTaiwan and t0 leapfrog into the Northern region. We have also shifted awayfrom regular gift-with-purchase approach to eradicate unhealthy onlinediscounting practices among an isolated few distributors. We believe that thesestrategies will take time to gain acceptance.
Over the last three to four years in Indonesia, we have managed to nurture
a group of new distributors and hence, also built a base of loyal customers.During this time, we made a deliberate strategic shift in focus from our
weight management line to our skincare line, in order to increase revenuecontribution per member, We are still in transition while the current group
of distributors adapt to the change in product mix focus. This resulted in amarginal decline of 1.1% in revenue from Indonesia y-o-y, in IDR terms. Wewill continue to step up our efforts in marketing activities to drive membershipgrowth, education and sales.

Summary of significant accounting policiesBasis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statement of financial position and statement ofchanges in equity of the Company have been prepared in accordance with Singapore Financial ReportingStandards (“FRS”).
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except as disclosed in the accountingpolicies below.
The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars (SGD or $) and all values in the tables are roundedto the nearest thousand ($’000), except when otherwise indicated.
Convergence with International Financial Reporting Standards
For annual financial period beginning on or after 1 January 2018, Singapore-incorporated companies listed onthe Singapore Exchange will apply Singapore Financial Reporting Framework (International), a new financialreporting framework identical to International Financial Reporting Standards. The Group has adopted SFRS(I)on lJanuary 2018.
The Group has performed an assessment of the impact of adopting SFRS(I). On transition to SFRS(I), the Groupexpects to elect the option to deem cumulative translation differences for foreign operations to be zero on 1 J anuary2017, and accordingly, the gain or loss that will be recognised on a subsequent disposal of the foreign operationswill exclude cumulative translation differences that arose before 1 January 2017, The Group expects to reclassifyan amount of $1,563,000 of foreign currency translation reserve to the opening retained earnings as at 1 January2017.
Other than the impact on adoption of the SFRS(I) 9 and SFRS(I) 16, the Group expects that adoption of SFRS(I)will have no material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application. The Group expects theimpact of adopting SFRS(I) 9 Will be similar to the impact on adoption of FRS 109 as disclosed in Note 2.3.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Standards issued but not yet effective (cont'd)This assessment may be subject to changes arising from ongoing analysis until the Group adopts FRS 115 in 2018.
Except for FRS 109 and FRS 116, the directors expect that the adoption of the SFRS(I) equivalent of the abovestandards will have no material impact on the financial statements in the year of initial application. The natureof the impending changes in accounting policy on adoption of FRS 109 and FRS 116 are described below.
FRS 109 Financial Instruments
FRS 109 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment offinancial assets and hedge accounting, and is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018.Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash ﬂow characteristics and the business modelunder which they are held. The impairment requirements in FRS 109 are based on an expected credit 1055 modeland replace the FRS 39 incurred loss model.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date without restating prior period’sinformation and recognises any difference between the previous carrying amount and the carrying amount at thebeginning of the annual reporting period at the date of initial application in the opening retained earnings.
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 109 based on currently availableinformation. This assessment may be subject to changes arising from ongoing analysis.
(3) Classification and measurement
The Group’s debt instruments are expected to give rise to cash ﬂows representing solely payments ofprincipal and interest. The Group intends to hold its currently held-to-maturity instruments to collectcontractual cash ﬂows, and accordingly, measured at amortised cost when it applies FRS 109. For itsheld»for-trading quoted debt securities, the Group will continue to measure the debt instrument at fair valuethrough profit or loss when it applies FRS 109‘ The Group does not expect any significant impact to arisefrom these changes.
In addition, the Company currently has loans to subsidiaries which are non-interest bearing and notexpected to be settled in the foreseeable future and carried them at cost. Under FRS 109, the Companywill be required to measure these receivables at fair value when the Company applies FRS 109. Anydifference between the previous carrying amount under FRS 39 and the fair value would be recognised inthe opening retained earnings when the Company applies FRS 109.
(b) ImpairmentFRS 109 requires the Group and the Company to record expected credit losses on all its debt securities,loans, trade receivables, and financial guarantees, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. The Groupexpects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses on all trade and otherreceivables. Upon application of the expected credit loss model, the Group expects no significant adjustmentto the loss allowance.

FRS 116 Leases
FRS 116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reﬂect the rights to use the leasedassets and the associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense anddepreciation charges The standard includes two recognition exemption for lessees - leases of ‘low value’ assetsand short-term leases. The new standard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019.
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of FRS 116. The Group expectsthe adoption of the new standard will result in increase in total assets and total liabilities, Earnings before Interest,Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and gearing ratio.
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date by applying FRS 116 retrospectivelywith the cumulative effect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as atIJanuary 2019.
The Group is currently in the process of analysing the transitional approaches and practical expedients to beelected on transition to FRS 116 and assessing the possible impact on adoption.
Basis of consolidation and business combinations
(3) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiariesas at the end of the reporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparationof the consolidated financial statements are prepared for the same reporting date as the Company.Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra-grouptransactions and dividends are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtainscontrol, and continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Losses vw'thin a subsidiary are attributed to the non-eontrolling interest even if that results in a deﬁcit balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equitytransaction. If the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it:
— De-recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amountsat the date when control is lost;
— De-reoognises the carrying amount of any non-controlling interest;
— De-recognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;— Recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
— Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
— Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
— Re-classifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive incometo profit or loss or retained earnings, as appropriate.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)
2.4 Basis of consolidation and business combinations (cont'd)
(b) Business combinations and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method. Identifiable assets acquiredand liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisitiondate. Acquisition-related costs are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurredand the services are received.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at theacquisition date. Subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent consideration which is deemed tobe an asset or liability, will be recognised in profit or loss.
The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non-controlling interest in theacquiree (if any), that are present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate shareof net assets in the event of liquidation, is recognised on the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Other components ofnon-controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value, unless another measurementbasis is required by another FRS.
Any excess of the sum of the fair Value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, theamount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), and the fair value of the Group’s previouslyheld equity interest in the acquiree (if any), over the net fair value of the aequiree’s identifiable assets andliabilities is recorded as goodwill. In instances where the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess isrecognised as gain on bargain purchase in profit or loss on the acquisition date.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less anyaccumulated impairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisitiondate, allocated to the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies 0f thecombination, irrespective ofwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
The cash~generating units to which goodwill have been allocated is tested for impairment annually andwhenever there is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determinedfor goodwill by assessing the recoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash-generatingunits) to which the goodwill relates.
2.5 Transactions with non-controlling interests
98
Non-Controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners ofthe Company.
Changes in the Company’s ownership interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accountedfor as equity transactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non-controllinginterests are adjusted to reﬂect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference betweenthe amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid orreceived is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Foreign currency
The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company’s functional currency.Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statements ofeach entity are measured using that functional currency.
(a) Transactions and balancesTransactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Companyand its subsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange ratesapproximating those ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated inforeign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting periodNon-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated usingthe exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value ina foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair Value Was measured.
Exchange differences arising 0n the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at theend of the reporting period are recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Consolidatedfinancial statements
For consolidation purposes, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into SGD at therate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at theweighted average exchange rates for the year. The exchange differences arising on the translation arerecognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of othercomprehensive income relating to that particular foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
Property, plant and equipment
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Subsequent to recognition, property,plant and equipment other than freehold land, are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and anyaccumulated impairment losses.
Freehold land has unlimited useful life and therefore is not depreciated.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line method over their estimated useful lives of these assets as follow:Leasehold building - Over the terms of lease that are from 1.3% to 70.6%Plant and equipment - 8% to 33%
Construction in progress included in property, plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are notyet available for use.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes incircumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year-end, and adjustedprospectively, if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits areexpected from its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on de-reoognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in theyear the asset is derecognised.

Summary of significant accounting policies (cont'd)Investment property
Investment property is a property that is either owned by the Group or leased under a finance lease that is held toearn rentals or for capital appreciation or both, rather than for use in the production or supply of goods orservices, or for administrative purposes, or in the ordinary course of business. Investment property comprisescompleted investment property and property that is being constructed or developed for future use as investmentproperty. Property held under operating lease is classified as investment property when the definition of aninvestment property is met.
Investment property is initially measured at cost, including transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition,investment properties are measured at cost less any accumulated depreciation and accumulated impainnent losses.
Depreciation is computed on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful life of the remaining terms of leasethat is 1.3%.
Investment property is derecognised When either it has been disposed of or when the investment property ispermanently withdrawn from use and no future economic benefit is expected from its disposal. Any gain orloss on the retirement or disposal of an investment property is recognised in profit or loss in the year ofretirement or disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost. Following initial acquisition, intangible assetsare carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses.
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either finite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised over the estimated useful lives and assessed for impairmentwhenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and theamortisation method are reviewed at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or theexpected pattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted for by changingthe amortisation period or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives or not yet available for use are tested for impairment annually,
or more frequently if the events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired eitherindividually or at the cash-generating unit level. Such intangible assets are not amortised. The useful life of anintangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessmentcontinues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indeﬁnite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from de-recognition of an intangible asset are measured as the difference between thenet disposal proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in profit or loss when the asset isderecognised.
Amortisation is computed on the straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the intangible assets asfollows:
Licenses - 10 to 25 yearsTrademarks - 5 to 10 yearsCustomer relationship - 5 years
Other intangible asset 38 years
