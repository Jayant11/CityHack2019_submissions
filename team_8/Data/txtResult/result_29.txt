Singapore Exchange
Dear Shareholders
In FY2017, Singapore Exchange (SGX) focused onbuilding a business that will sustain performanceinto the future, against the backdrop ofmacroeconomic and geopolitical uncertainties,rising competition and increasing disruption inthe business of fundraising.
FY2017‘s net proﬁt fell 3% to $339.7 million, on theback ofa 2% decline in revenue to $800.8 million.Our commitment to cost discipline has enabled us todeliver a ﬂatjaw for FY2017. as operating expensesdeclined 2% to $399.0 million.
We continue to return value to our shareholders inthe form ofdividends. The Board has proposed a ﬁnaldividend of13 cents per share forthe fourth quartersTogether with the interim dividends paid for the ﬁrstthree quarters, the total dividend for FY2017 wouldbe 28 cents per share, which represents an 88%payout ofthe FY2017 net proﬁt.
As detailed in the preceding section of this annualreport, SGX's strategy is built on two main pillars 7Equities and Fixed Income, and Derivatives —
and a smaller but increasingly important pillar.Market Data and Connectivity. Our progresstowards a more balanced multi-asset revenuebase is the result of deliberate steps we havetaken in recent years in executing our growth anddiversiﬁcation strategy.
We ﬁrmly believe that our diversiﬁcation
into multiple asset classes covering differentgeographies has not only enabled us to sustainconsistent ﬁnancial performance through differentmarket environments, but also reinforced ourvitalrole as the most international exchange in Asia
Our strategic direction will see us driving plans todeepen our geographical footprint, particularly
in the US and the UK, broaden the distributionnetwork of our products and services, and grow ourclient base. The investments that we have made areto prepare ourselves for the future, and reﬂect howwe have planned ahead for growth, although someinvestments will require a longer incubation periods
Letter from the Chairman and the CEO

Our Fixed Incomebusiness has turned in a record performance, with819 bond listings raising $384.7 billion. up 135% and124% respectivelyfrom FY2016. Since we launchedour SGX BondPro trading platform in 2016, we haveseen encouraging client adoption and transactionvolumes, supporting our aim to be the leadingprovider of liquidity forAsian ﬁxed income.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the Directors’ Statement (but does notinclude the ﬁnancial statements and our auditor's report thereon), which we obtained prior to the date of this auditor's report,and the other sections of the annual report (“the Other Sections), which are expected to be made available to us after that date.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not and will not express any form ofassurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information identified aboveand, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or ourknowledge obtained in the audit, or otherwise appears to be materially misstated.
If, based on the work we have performed on the other information that we obtained prior to the date of this auditor’s report,we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information, we are required to report that fact. We havenothing to report in this regard.
When we read the Other Sections, if we conclude that there is a material misstatement therein, we are required tocommunicate the matter to those charged with governance and take appropriate actions in accordance with SSAs.
Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with theprovisions of the Act and FRSS, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufficient to providea reasonable assurance that assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition: and transactions areproperly authorised and that they are recorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statementsand to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group's ability to continue as a goingconcern. disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unlessmanagement either intends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.
Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from materialmisstatement. whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assuranceis a high level ofassurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect amaterial misstatement when it exists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individuallyor in the aggregate. they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of thesefinancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance with SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticismthroughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the finantial statements, whether due to fraud or error, designand perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate toprovide a basis for our opinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher thanfor one resulting from error, as fraud may involve collusion, forgery. intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or theoverride of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriatein the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group's internalcontrol.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and relateddisclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the auditevidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubton the Group's ability to continue as a going concern If we contlude that a material uncertainty exists, we are requiredto draw attention in our auditor’s report to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosuresare inadequate. to modify our opinion Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of ourauditor's report However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern.

Signiﬁcant accounting policies (continued)
Employee beneﬁts
Employee benefits are recognised as employeecompensation expense when they are due, unless theycan be capitalised as an asset.
Defined contribution plans
The Group makes legally required contributions tothe Central Provident Fund (“Fund). The Group'sobligation, in regard to the defined contribution plan.is limited to the amount it contributes to the Fund.The Group’s contributions are recognised as employeecompensation expense when they are due.
Employee leave entitlement (k)
Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognisedwhen they accrue to employees. A provision is madefor the estimated liability for annual leave as a resultof services rendered by employees up to the balancesheet date.
Share-based compensation
The fair value of employee services received inexchange for equity-settled share-based remunerationplans granted to employees is recognised as share-based payment to employees in profit or loss with acorresponding increase in the share-based paymentreserve over the vesting period. The amount isdetermined by reference to the fair value of the shareson grant date and the expected number of shares to bevested on vesting date.
At the end of each financial reporting period, theCompany revises its estimates of the expected numberof shares that the participants are expected to receiveAny changes to the expected number of shares to bevested will entail a corresponding adjustment to theshare-based payment to employees and share-basedpayment reserve.
Upon vesting of a sharerbased compensation plan, theportion of share-based payment previously recognisedin the share-based payment reserve is reversed againsttreasury shares. Differences between sharevbasedpayment and cost of treasury shares are taken to theshare capital of the Company.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash on handand deposits with banks which are subject to aninsignificant risk of change in value.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised on thedate they are originated and initially at fair valueand subsequently measured at amortised cost usingthe effective interest method, less an allowance forimpairment. An allowance for impairment of tradeand other receivables is recognised when there is
objective evidence that the Group will not be able tocollect amounts due according to the original terms
of the receivables The amount of the allowance is
the difference between the assets carrying amountand the present value of estimated future cash flows,discounted at the original effective interest rate and isrecognised in profit or loss
The allowance for impairment loss is reduced throughprofit or loss in a subsequent period when the amountof impairment loss decreases and the related decreasecan be objectively measured. The carrying amount ofthe asset previously impaired is increased to the extentthat the new carrying amount does not exceed theamortised cost had no impairment been recognised inprior periods.
Availa ble-for-sale ﬁnancial assets
Availablefor-sale financial assets are initiallyrecognised at fair value plus transaction costs and aresubsequently carried at fair value. Purchase and salesof availableeforrsale financial assets are recognised ontrade date, on which the Group commits to purchaseor sell the asset. Investments are derecognised whenthe rights to receive cash flows from the available-foresale financial assets have expired or all risks andrewards of ownership have been transferred. Changesin fair values of availabIe-for-sale equity securitiesare recognised in the fair value reserve, together withthe related currency translation differences. The fairvalue of available-for-sale financial assets not tradedin an active market are determined by using valuationtechniques such as discounted cash flow analysis.
Dividends on availabIe-for-sale financial assets arerecognised in profit or loss when the right to receivepayment is established.
When availabIe-for-sale financial assets are sold,
the difference between the carrying amount and thesales proceeds is recognised in the proﬁt or loss. Theaccumulated fair value adjustments recognised in thefair value reserve within equity are reclassified to profitor loss.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whetherthere is objective evidence that the availablevforvsalefinancial assets are impaired. A significant or prolongeddecline in the fair value of the availabIe-for-sale financialasset below its cost is considered an indicator that theavailable~for~sale financial asset is impaired. When thereis objective evidence that an available-for-sale financialasset is impaired, the cumulative loss that has beenrecognised directly in the fair value reserve is removedfrom the fair value reserve within equity and recognisedin profit or loss The cumulative loss is measured as thedifference between the acquisition cost and the currentfair value, less any impairment loss on that availabIe-for-sale financial asset previously recognised in profit or lossImpairment losses previously recognised in profit or losson availabie-for-sale equity securities are not reversedthrough profit or loss in subsequent period.

Useful lives
_easeh0|d improvements 1 to 7 years or lease term,whichever is shorter
Building and plant 25 to 50 years
:urniture, fittings and 3 to 10 years (n)office equipment

Cost also includes any fair value gains orlosses on qualifying cash flow hedges of computersoftware that are transferred from the hedging reservesCosts associated with maintaining computer softwareare expensed off when incurred.
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised
on the basis of the cost incurred to acquire and otherdirectly attributable costs of preparing the software forits intended use. Direct expenditures, including employeecosts, which enhance or extend the performance ofcomputer software programmes beyond their originalspecifications, and which can be reliably measured, arerecognised as a capital improvement and added to theoriginal cost of the software,
Computer software costs and acquired computersoftware licences are stated at cost less accumulatedamortisation and accumulated impairment losses.These costs are amortised using the straight-linemethod over their estimated useful lives. a period notexceeding 7 years. Where an indication of impairmentexists, the carrying amount is assessed and writtendown immediately to its recoverable amount.
The period and method of amortisation of the softwareare reviewed at least at each financial year end. Theeffects of any revision of the amortisation period ormethod are included in profit or loss for the period inwhich the changes arises
Intangible assets
Intangible assets arising from business combinations areinitially recognised at cost and are subsequently carriedat cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulatedimpairment losses. These costs are amortised to profitor loss using the straight-line method over the estimateduseful life of 30 years of the underlying asset,
The period and method of amortisation of intangibleassets are reviewed at least at each period end. Theeffects of any revision of the amortisation period ormethod are included in profit or loss for the period inwhich the changes arise.

the carrying amounts of the replaced components
are recognised in profit or loss. All other repair andmaintenance expenses are recognised in profit or losswhen incurred. On disposal of an investment property,the difference between the net disposal proceeds andthe carrying amount is recognised in profit or loss.
Goodwill on acquisitions
Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses, (2)represents the excess of(i) the sum of the considerationtransferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest
in the acquiree and the acquisitionrdate fair value
of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over
(ii) the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired,Goodwill on subsidiaries is recognised separately as
intangible assets and carried at cost less accumulatedimpairment losses,
Goodwill on acquisitions of associated companiesrepresents the excess of the cost of the acquisition overthe Group's share of the fair value of the identifiablenet assets acquired. Goodwill 0n associated companiesis included in the carrying amount of the investments.
Investments in subsidiaries and associated companies
Investments in subsidiaries and associated companiesare stated at cost less accumulated impairment lossesin the statement of financial position of the Company.Where an indication of impairment exists. the carryingamount of the investment is assessed and writtendown to its recoverable amount. Impairment lossesare recognised in the profit or loss in the year in whichit is determined.
On disposal of an investment, the difference betweenthe net proceeds and its carrying amount is recognisedin profit or loss.
Impairment of non-finantial assetsGoodwill
Goodwill recognised separately as an intangible assetis tested for impairment annually and wheneverthere is indication that the goodwill may be impaired.Goodwill included in the carrying amount of aninvestment in associated company orjoint venture
is tested for impairment as part of the investment,rather than separately,
(S)
For the purpose of impairment testing of goodwill,goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's cash-generatingrunits (CGU) expected to benefit fromsynergies arising from the business combination. ACGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets thatgenerate cash inflows that are largely independent ofthe cash inflows from other assets or group of assets
An impairment loss is recognised when the carryingamount ofa CGU, including the goodwill, exceeds therecoverable amount of the CGU. Recoverable amount ofa CGU is the higher of the CGU's fair value less cost tosell and vaiue-in-use.
The total impairment loss of a CGU is allocated first toreduce the carrying amount of goodwill allocated to theCGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rataon the basis 0fthe carrying amount of each asset in
the CGU.
Ari impairment loss on goodwill is recognised as anexpense and is not reversed in a subsequent period.

An impairment loss is recognised for theamount by which the assets carrying amount exceedsits recoverable amount, which is the higher ofan asset'snet selling vaiue and its value in use. The impairmentloss is recognised in profit or loss.
The recoverable amount is determined on an individualasset basis unless the asset does not generate cashflows that are largely independent of those from otherassets If this is the case, the recoverable amount isdetermined for the CGU to which the asset belongs.
An impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill isreversed if, and only if, there has been a change in theestimates used to determine the assets recoverableamount since the last impairment loss was recognised.The carrying amount of this asset is increased to
its revised recoverable amount, provided that thisamount does not exceed the carrying amount thatwould have been determined (net ofany accumulatedamortisation or depreciation) had no impairment lossbeen retognised for the asset in prior years. A reversalof impairment ioss for an asset other than goodwill isrecognised in profit or loss,
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables represent liabilities for goodsand services provided to the Group prior to the end offinancial year which are unpaid. They are classified ascurrent liabilities, if payment is due within one year
or less. Otherwise, they are presented as non-currentliabilities

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a legalor constructive obligation as a result of past events, it isprobable that an outflow of resources will be requiredto settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate of theamount of the obligation can be made, Changes in theestimated amount are recognised in profit or loss whenthe changes arise.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging activities
A derivative ﬁnancial instrument is initially recognised
at its fair value on the date the contract is entered (X)into and is subsequently carried at its fair value.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or lossdepends on whether the derivative is designated as ahedging instrument. and if so. the nature of the item
being hedged.
The Group documents at the inception of the
transaction the relationship between the hedging
instruments and hedged items. as well as its risk
management objective and strategies for undertaking
various hedge transactions. The Group also documents ( )its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an yongoing basis, on whether the derivatives designated
as hedging instruments are highly effective in offsettingchanges in fair value or cash flows of the hedged items,
Derivatives that are designated as hedging instrument
are designated by the Group as cash ﬂow hedge. Fair 3.value changes on derivatives that are not designated or
do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in
profit or loss when the changes arise.

The Group has entered into currency forwards that
qualify as cash flow hedges against highly probableforecastec transactions in foreign currencies The (a)fair value changes on the effective portion of the
currency forwards designated as cash flow hedges arerecognisec in the hedging reserve and transferred to
either the cost of a hedged nonvmonetary asset uponacquisition or profit or loss when the hedged forecasttransactions are recognised.
The fair va ue of currency forward contracts purchasedor sold is based on the quoted bid price or offer pricerespective y at the balance sheet date. The notionalprincipal amounts of the currency forward contractsare recorded as off—balance sheet items.
The fair va ue changes on the ineffective portion of
currency forwards are recognised immediately in
profit or loss When a forecasted transaction is no (b)longer expected to occur, the gains and losses that
were previously recognised in the hedging reserve aretransferrec to profit or loss immediately.

to seek advantages for our businesses. In FY2018,we will complete the upgrade 0fthe SecuritiesPost Trade Systems to support the brokers in
the securities market and enhance the CDP’Son-Iine capabilities, In addition, we are activelyexperimenting with newer technologies , both
in data and distributed ledgers — and will be anactive participant in a MonetaryAuthority ofSingapore (MAS) initiative to explore the use ofthese technologies in the Singapore GovernmentBond Market. We will also continue to invest furtherin developing our capabilities on our bond tradingplatform, SGX BondPro.
Our Derivatives business delivered a resilientperformance in FY2017, and we continued toentrench our leadership as the largest offshoremarket for Asian derivatives across multiple assetclasses, With the launch of our SGX TITAN platform,our derivative members and participants canmanage their positions round the clock.
While derivatives revenue and total volumesdeclined, we have employed our operating andbusiness strategies well to deliver market sharegrowth in almost all our key derivative products.Liquidity improved across our growing portfolio,with average monthend open interest up 13% year»onryear to 4.2 million contracts. Our equity indexfutures continued to provide an avenue for globalinvestors to navigate risk across key Asian markets.Notably, we achieved record volumes in our MSC]Singapore Index (SiMSCI) futures, with open interestreaching a new high in June and volume for the yearup by 38% yearronryear.
Letter from the Chairman and the CEO
Our foreign exchange (FX) portfolio is a solidcontributor to our strategy to grow across assetclasses. We saw standout performance in ourUSD/CNH and INR/USD futures contracts,
which on average traded over US$740 million
and US$800 million a day respectively in June,contributing substantiallyto more than three timesvolume gain for our FX contracts between FY2015and FY2017. Supported by Singapore's position as thethird-Iargest FX market globally, SGX continues tobuild its Asian FX product suite In July this year, welaunched four new SGX Asian FX futures contracts 7IDR/USD, MYR/USD, MYR/SGD and PHP/USD.
With continued price volatility in steel raw materials,SGX maintained its leadership in iron ore derivatives,increasing its share of the offshore market to over90%. We have also seen exciting signs of growth inthe coking coal derivatives market, with our cokingcoal futures daily volumes this year increasingeightrfold since the fourth quarter of 2016 andreaching record levels of open interest. We seegreat opportunity in nurturing participation in ourcoking coal futures. which together with our iron orecontracts, offer participants in the downstream steelindustry the ability to manage upstream volatility
as well as gain margin efﬁciencies from trading the“virtual steel mill.
Over the past two years, we have grown ourfreightderivatives business ﬁve times to become one
of the major clearing houses for forward freightagreements (FFAs) globally. The acquisition of
the Baltic Exchange highlights the value we see
in integrating the risk management of freight andcargo, given that seaborne bulk commodities are

The intangibie assets are the right to operate the Singapore electricity spot market, arising from the acquisition of EMCand BEL’s trade name arising from the acquisition of BEL (Note 21)
No impairment loss has been recognised as there is no objective evidence or indication that the carrying amounts maynot be fully recoverable as at 30 June 2017 (2016: Nil).
Goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill is as follows:

The Group2017 2016s’ooo s’oooBeginning of financial year 9,614 9,614Acquisition of subsidiary (Note 21(C)) 76,224 —Cu rrency translation 2,563 —Balance at end of financial year 88,401 9,614

The goodwill relates to the acquisition of EMC, a subsidiary operating the Singapore eiectricity spot market andacquisition of BEL, a subsidiary providing freight market indices and information, membership serVices and facilities fortrading of derivative shipping contracts.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group's Cash Generating Unit (“CGU”) expectedto benefit from synergies 0f the business combination. Goodwill arising from the acquisition of EMC is allocated to EMCCGU and goodwiil arising from the acquisition of BEL is allocated to Derivatives CGU.
===================================================

The carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to the following CGUs as at 30 June were as follows:

The Group2017 20165’000 s'oooEMC 9,614 9,614Derivatives 78,787 788,401 9,614

The recoverable amount of the goodwill was determined based on valuerineuse caiculation using the discounted cashﬂow model. Key inputs of the computation are as follows:

CGU - EMC Key Inputs BasisFree cash flows Management’s forecasts of earnings and capital Past performance, expectations of electricity demandexpenditure over a teneyear period. growth in Singapore and market developments
Long term growth rate 2% - 3% (2016: 2% » 3%) Long term electricity demand growth and long term
growth rate and inflation of the Singapore economy
Discount rate 9.5% (2016: 915%) Cost of capital to operate the Singapore electricityspot market


CGU - Derivatives Key Inputs BasisFree cash flows Management’s forecasts of earnings and capital Past performance, expectations of growthexpenditure over a ten»year period. in derivatives contract volumes and
market developmentsLong term growth rate 3% Long term growth rate of developed economies
Discount rate 9.5% Cost of capital to operate the Singaporederivatives market

Based on the valuerinruse calculations. there is no impairment on goodwill (FY2016: Nil). While the estimated recoverableamount of the goodwill is sensitive to any change in key inputs to the valuein-use calculations, the change in theestimated recoverable amount from any reasonably possible change on the key input does not materially cause therecoverable amount to be lower than its carrying amount.
Business combinations
On 8 November 2016, SGX acquired 100% of the equity interest in BEL for a consideration of $138,794,000(GBP 77,616,000). Consequently. BEL became a wholly owned subsidiary
The principal activity of BEL is to provide freight market indices and information, membership services and facilities forthe trading of derivatives shipping contracts. This acquisition strengthens our abiiity to further develop forward freightagreement (“FFA”) related products.

Withthe transaction now complete, the stage is set fordeeper collaboration between the two markets.We are conﬁdent in our ability to further drive thegrowth of FFA volumes and tap the opportunity todevelop new freight derivatives centred on activeAsian shipping routes.
Since the close of the acquisition in November2016, the Baltic Exchange has already strengthenedits presence in Asia, gaining 15 new members in

we will develop new freight benchmarks forcomplementary commodities, such as LNG freight,to support Sling, SGX’S LNG spot priting tool,
SGX’s long-term success relies on its ability tomaintain a solid record as a market regulator andoperator. As markets evolve, and investors andcompanies become more sophisticated, we mustinnovate and regulate in a forwardrlookingandpurposeful manner.

As the Group and the Company are not exposed to significant interest rate risks, a sensitivity analysis is not provided.
Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in ﬁnancial loss to theGroup and the Company The major classes of financial assets of the Group and of the Company are trade receivables andcash deposits.
The Group manages its main credit exposures as follows:
(a)
(b)
Cash deposits
Cash balances of the Group and the Company are mainly placed in fixed deposits with financial institutions of highcredit quality. The Board has approved policies that limit the maximum credit exposure to each financial institution.Exposure and compliance with counterparty limits set by the RMC are monitored by the relevant business unitsand reported by the Risk Management unit to the RMC. The Group ptaced 67% (2016: 83%) of its cash and cashequivalents with 4 (2016: 4) banks. The Company placed 96% (2016: 99%) of its cash and cash equivalents with 4(2016: 4) banks.
Clearing and settlement
In the normal course of business as clearing houses, SGXVDC and CDP act as centrat counterparties (“CCP”) for everytransaction received by or matched through the Group's facilities, As CCP, each clearing house substitutes itself as thebuyer to the selling clearing member, and seller to the buying Clearing member, and assumes all rights and obligationsto the counterparty. As a result, each clearing house faces considerable credit risk exposure should any of its clearingmembers be unable to meet its settlement obligations to the clearing house, resulting in a default. The Group has inplace a sound and transparent risk management and regulatory framework governing the operations of securities andderivatives markets. On an on-going basis, the Group mitigates its counterparty risk through active monitoring andmanagement of its exposures to clearing members by having in place a system of ﬁnancial safeguards.
===================================================
154.hocr: 
Singapore Exchange annual report 2017
(C)
Credit risk management practices
The Group mitigates its exposures to risk by admitting clearing members which meet prescribed capital and financialrequirements and have risk management systems to monitor their exposures On an ongoing basis. a clearingmember must continue to comply with the financial requirements, and also set aside capital commensurate with
its risk exposures. In addition, it must ensure that it has the necessary systems and procedures to preserve soundliquidity and financial position at all times.
Both SGX-DC and CDP have well-established risk management systems to monitor and measure the risk exposures ofits members. In addition, SGX-DC and CDP require all cleared positions and contracts to be sufficiently collateralisedat all times to protect SGXaDC and CDP against potential losses. SGXVDC also revalues and settles the daily markrtormarket variations with clearing members to prevent losses from accumulating CDP also requires clearing membersto monitor compliance with risk management measures such as monitoring for large exposures.
Financial safeguards
A clearing fund has been established for each of the securities and derivatives markets to be used in support ofthe clearing houses’ roles as CCP. The Group and the relevant clearing members are required to contribute to therespective clearing funds.
Trude receivables arising from settlement ofsecurities trades
Settlement for all securities transactions of securities clearing members are effected through the Group’s subsidiary.CDP. Such settlements can be effected through designated settlement banks.
The “receivables from clearing members and settlement banks included in trade receivables represent the aggregateof net settlement obligations of each of the clearing members and settlement banks to CDP for the last three tradingdays of the financial year. At 30 June 2017, there were 26 (2016: 25) securities clearing members and 7 (2016: 7)designated settlement banks. The Group may have concentration risk exposure to these securities clearing membersand settlement banks with regards to their net settlement obligations to CDP‘ The settlement exposure of CDP toeach securities clearing member or settlement bank fluctuates daily according to the net trading position (net buy
or net sell) of each securities clearing member and the extent to which these settlement obligations are effectedthrough the settlement banks.
Receivables under NEMS
In relation to NEMS receivables in Note 14, EMC is required to ensure that market participants maintain certain levelsof prudential security in discharging its obligations under the NEMS Market Rules (“Market Rules). EMC is entitled torecover any default receivables from all market participants under the Market Rule and credit risk exposure to NEMSreceivables is minimised.
Under the Market Rules, each market participant has to provide credit support which is not less than 30 times ofindividual estimated average daily exposure, The Market Rules specify the type of credit support to be provided andassigned to EMC. These include bankers' guarantees or irrevocable commercial letter of credit from reputable financialinstitutions. cash deposits and Singapore Government Treasury bills.

The fair vaiues of currency forward contracts have been calcuiated using the rates quoted by the Group's bankers toterminate the contracts at the balance sheet date.
The availabieTor-sale financial asset consist of unlisted equity security which had been disposed during the financialyear(Note10).As the unlisted equity security is not traded in an active market, its fair value is determined by usingdiscounted cash flow model in FY2016.

The unlisted equity security has been classified under Level 3 in the fair value measurement hierarchy as the valuationtechnique includes market premium on the discount rate, which is an unobservable market data. The movement in fair valuearising from reasonably possible changes to the market premium on the discount rate is assessed to be insignificant.
The carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables areassumed to approximate their fair values.

Capital requirement and management
The Group's capital management objectives are to optimise returns to sharehoiders whilst supporting the growthrequirements of the business and fulfilling its obligations to the relevant regulatory authorities and other stakeholders.
Effective 1 July 2008, the Group is required, under the Regulatory Capital Framework (“the Framework) formalised
by the Monetary Authority of Singapore to maintain adequate finantial resources to meet prudential requirements
that commensurate with the operational risk, investment risk and the counterparty default risk arising from its centralcounterparty clearing and settlement activities. With respect to the counterparty default risk, each of the Group’sciearing house subsidiaries is required to contribute capital to maintain a clearing fund that is sufficient to coversimultaneous default of the member that is responsible for largest credit exposure, its affiliates and the two financiallyweakest members under simulated extreme but plausible market conditions, The Group has been in compliance with theFramework since1July 2008,
Given the dynamic nature of the Group's business and the framework, the Group regularly reviews and monitors itscapital position to ensure that the business activities and growth are prudentiy funded. In addition, the Group will seekopportunities to optimise shareholders' returns by creating a more efficient capital structure to reduce the overall cost ofcapital. In line with its dividend policy, SGX maintains a base dividend commitment to its shareholders.

KeyTrends
SGX's continued success in creating sustainable shareholdervalue is largely inﬂuenced
by a number of key trends. Management has reviewed and identiﬁed 4 keytrends,
They encompass the global macroeconomic environment, global regulatory landscape,competition, and technology. Each key trend brings unique risks and opportunities to theorganisation, and is a major consideration in our approach to the formulation of our strategicpriorities. We regularly review these keytrends to assess their impact on our business modeloverthe near, medium and long term future,

A key factor inﬂuencing ourbusiness performance is the levelof market activity.
Our securities and derivatives markets areprimarily inﬂuenced by volatility in the Asianﬁnancial markets. Higher market volatility oftenleads to increased demand for trading andhedging, and may create additional opportunitiesfor arbitrage and speculation. Conversely.sustained periods of low volatility, especially inbearish conditions, may result in lower levels ofmarket activity. In turn, volatility is susceptible tofactors inﬂuencing the global economy,
Demand for capital raising and the growthpotential of our listed companies are key factorsin generating market activity, particularly in oursecurities market, These factors are mainly drivennot only by local economic growth, but also bythe condition of our neighbouring economiessince a large number of our listed companies havebusinesses operating outside Singapore.
This past year, our businesses were signiﬁcantlyinﬂuenced by the manner in which marketparticipants adjusted to expected policy changesin benchmark interest rates, slower growth inthe global economy and volatile commodityprices. Geopolitical events took centre stage asmarkets adjust to Brexit and change in the USadministration. The change in US leadership
and geopolitical changes have led to uncertaintyin the Middle East and tensions in the SouthChina Sea and the Korean Peninsula. Singaporeprovides a neutral marketplace to meet theincreased need for ﬁnancial risk management andhedging in this region.
26
Exchanges and ﬁnancial institutions globally havebeen subjected to increasing levels of regulation sincehe global ﬁnancial crisis of 2008.
Whilst stringent regulations will result in a more robust global ﬁnancialsystem, increased regulatory requirements may lead to higher costs ofausiness and impact the pace of industry development in the near term.Our continued ability to meet the highest global regulatory standards,30th in the immediate future and over the longer term, is a competitiveadvantage that will enable us to achieve our growth objectives.
nternational regulatory bodies have introduced many regulations afterthe 2008 crisis. An important cornerstone is to incentivise trading onexchanges and clearing by central counterparties (CCPs) while imposingwigher capital requirements on nonecentrally cleared contracts. In thenearterm. SGX is well placed to navigate these new regulatory trends.3eing one ofthe ﬁrst exchanges globally to adopt the Principles forIinancial Market Infrastructure introduced by CPSS-IOSCO. We are alsocertiﬁed as a Qualifying Counterparty under the Basel ||| framework.and have attained from the US Commodity Futures Trading Commission(CFTC) the status of a Derivatives Clearing Organization (DCO) and:oreign Board ofTrade (FBOT). We were also recognised by the EuropeanSecurities and Markets Authority (ESMA) as a third-country centralcounterparty. These have enabled SGX to offer clearing services to
US and European customers.

New global regulations affecting SGX will continue to be phased in overthe coming few years. SGX and its participants may be impacted byforeign regulation through extravterritorial application or the inﬂuenceof such rules on domestic laws. The flow of political events, not leastthe withdrawal ofthe UK from the EU. may also shape the applicabilityand scope of certain regulations. It is imperative that SGX keep abreastof these developments and adapt accordingly to enable continuity ofservice to our participants.
In the long run, SGX will have to continuously navigate increasedregulatory complexities and adapt to how members, participants andcompetitors position themselves in the evolving global regulatorylandscape, with its impact on balance sheet management, risk appetitesand business strategies.
===================================================

F'
a
SGX faces competition in both our securitiesand derivatives markets from regional andglobal exchanges.
Increased competition may lead to slower growth, lower volumes
or lower margins, all ofwhich wi|| negatively impact our businessperformance. In the near to medium term, we remain conﬁdent that
we compete favourably against existing and potential competitors, onour strength as a diversiﬁed business, a platform for capital raising, andour unique value proposition as the only exchange offering singleipointaccess into key Asian markets. Our well-capitalised clearinghouses meetthe highest global regulatory standards. which provide a competitiveadvantage against our peers.
A potential competitive threat could be the internationalisation of theonshore Asian emerging markets. This may allow direct participationfrom offshore customers which may compromise our advantage ofbeing the only liquid offshore market forthe SGX FTSE China A50 Indexfutures. Iron Ore futures, and SGX Nifty 50 Index futures, Conversely,this may also lead to greater awareness of these contracts, resulting inincreased participation from international customers to the offshorecontracts traded on SGX and the respective onshore contracts. To furthermitigate the potential effects of competition, SGX is also focusing on itspriority of growing across asset classes and geographies. As part ofourstrategy, we will continue to enhance our platforms to develop customerstickiness We will also launch products that will widen ourAsian productsuite and create synergies across different asset classes.
The landscape for global exchanges is evolving rapidly. In recent years,we have seen exchanges expanding into adjacent businesses like indicesand electronic trading platforms. as well as scaling up through mergersand acquisitions. These two trends will impact our strategic positioningoverthe long term by widening the gap in market share between largeinternational exchanges and national exchanges.
We will continue to explore inorganic opportunities, partnerships andjoint ventures that will offer synergies, especially in product developmentand internationalising our distribution As an example, SGX acquired theBaltic Exchange to help drive the vertical integration ofthe entire steelmanufacturing value chain, from provision of market data to the tradingand clearing of iron ore, coking coal and freight derivative contracts,while taking advantage of Singapore’s location as a maritime hub.
Key Trends
annual report 2017

Technology is both a key enabler as well asa potential source of signiﬁcant disruptionto our business model in the long run.
We rely on technology across all aspects ofbusiness and operations, including our regulatoryand risk management functions. We focus
on enhancing operational resilience, whilesimultaneously seeking to future-proof our coretechnology and infrastructure forthe long termby making appropriate investments. Our approachin continually investing to refresh and upgradetechnology is crucial to our long term success asa systemically important ﬁnancial infrastructureof Singapore.
As a critical infrastructure provider of theSingapore ﬁnancial system, we contribute to
the industry development of security standardsand practices to address global cyber securityrisks. We are also progressively investing in newtechnology capabilities to improve our ability toanticipate, assess and manage these risks as theyevolve overtime.
The long-term trend is for exchanges to becomeintegrated platforms where a broad range ofproducts are easily listed and traded, includingproducts traditionally traded overthe counter.SGX is progressing along this trajectory, supportedby innovations in trading platforms, connectivity,as well as the continued enhancements of featuresand functionalities to cater to the expectations ofindustry participants.
The development of disruptive technologies couldchange the landscape of our industry over time.To remain relevant as a centre for capital raising,risk management and price discovery, we activelymonitor and participate in the development ofsuch technologies.

===================================================
32.hocr: 
Singapore Exchange
Types of risks
1. Credit Risks
Risks arising from potential default of a participant
SGX is a ﬁnancial market infrastructure and its business model isdifferent from that of most ﬁnancial institutions. As an exchange,SGX matches buyers with sellers. As a clearing house, SGX removescounterparty risk by serving as the central counterparty in everytrade - SGX becomes a buyer to every seller and a seller to everybuyer. In so doing, SGX plays the vital role as the risk managementhub, and limits contagion and the transfer of credit risk across theﬁnancial ecosystem.
Investors access SGXthrough our members, who are required tomeet payment obligations in a timely manner, SGX collects marginfrom its members multiple times daily to reduce credit risk.
In this business model. SGX is put at risk only in the rare instancethat a member defaults. Should this happen, our clearing house willneed to manage, transfer and closerut the open positions ofthedefaulted ﬁrm. SGX and other members may need to absorb thelosses from the resulting market risk.
2, Liquidity Risks
Risks arising from potential default of a participant
In the rare event ofa memberdefault, SGX may need liquidity inhonouring payment obligations to other members. This is becauseit will no longer receive payments from the defaulted member.
In addition, in facilitating dayrtorday settlement of paymentsand safekeeping of customer monies, the clearing house usescommercial banks. A counterparty default of such a commercialbank, though highly unlikely. will expose SGX t0 liquidity risks.
Risk Management
annual report 2017
What are we doing about it?

SGX has established layers of defences to safeguard its clearinghouse against members‘ credit risk.
Good quality members are screened at admission. Their creditstanding and internal risk management capability are reviewedregularly as part ofongoing supervision.
Active monitoring of members‘ positions and acute awareness
of market conditions and political events enable preemptivemitigating actions to be taken by SGX. This ensures that risk
does not concentrate on any particular member and remainsmanageable, Margin requirements fortrade exposures are regularlyreviewed for adequacy and margins are collected promptly.
A robust default management protocol is set Up to ensure thatin the rare event ofa member default, trades belonging to thedefaulted member can be managed in an orderlyfashion. Thispreserves market continuity and limits any market risk fallout.Furthermore. to protect investors in a default. customer moniesare segregated and held in trust,
SGX and its members contribute resources to a default fund thatis strong enough to withstand multiple member defaults. Theresources to manage a potential credit event have been stresstested to cover multiple extreme and plausible scenarios.
SGX is committed to the safety of the Singapore marketplace.
and as a result, contributes at least 25% ofthe default fund usingits own capital. one ofthe highest “skin in the game among globalclearing houses.
SGX sets aside resources to cover liquidity risks. To providesufﬁcient headroom, we perform a “liquidity stress test whichsimulates a variety of hypothetical default scenarios under severestress conditions involving members and commercial banks. Thispractice ensures that even under such extreme but plausiblescenarios, SGX will have sufﬁcient cash resources and credit lines.
SGX actively manages counterparty risk exposure to commercialbanks by using only ﬁnancially strong banks and monitoring theircredit quality We set limits to how much we can be exposed toeach bank, while ensuring that we have standby liquidity linesfrom other banks.

SGX is a ﬁnancial infrastructure that is heavily reliant on technology.
We are committed to ensuring that our trading, clearing anddepository systems adhere to high standards of latency. volumecapacity. and sen/ice availability. Any service interruption could leadto reputational risk and potential loss of revenue.
Operational resilience also extends to our human resources.SGX needs to protect its staff from a wide range ofthreats toensure market continuity in the event ofcivil crises such asterrorism or pandemic.
SGX regularly runs enterprise business continuity exercises acrosstechnology, ﬁnancial. physical security and pandemic scenarios toraise risk awareness and vigilance across the organisation.
Increasing threat of cyber-attacks
Singapore's ﬁnancial centre is a target for cyber criminals.
with increasing cyber-attacks experienced by the various ﬁnanclalinstitutions. Similar to other ﬁnancial institutions, SGX hasexperienced a rise in such activities compared to previous years.
32
What are we doing about it?

Our systems are constantly monitored and required to meetspeciﬁc performance criteria such as predictable response timesfor critical business transactions, latency, capacity and expectedcurrent, future and peak load. SGX technology and operationspersonnel work from two locations supported by dual datacentres as a fail-safe design. The backup systems are designed tobe running all the time in active or fault tolerant conditions andhave recovew time objectives (RTO) in line with PFMI standards.
SGX has a thorough process for self»assessment of ourcapabilities, using both past experiences and experiences ofourglobal peers to drive continuous improvements that will providegreater operational resiliency.
For example. we continually assess potential scenarios andthreats that could disrupt the exchange and clearing house, andperform business contingency drills regularlyto ensure that staffrespond effectively and SGX services are recovered quickly tominimise the impact on market users. This year. we held regularexercises with the industryto validate SGX’s crisis responses andlevel of preparedness for business continuity.
SGX monitors the cyber threat environment on an ongoingbasis to ensure that cyber risk is managed. We assess ourcyber security maturity on a yearly basis to continually rectifyIdentiﬁed gaps.

Sustainability remains core to the long,term viability of our organisation. Wehave identiﬁed 4 material factors thatare important to the sustainability ofour organisation. They are EconomicPerformance, Socio-Economic Impacts,Governance, and People. Our businesspractices, developed with these materialfactors as a foundation, will enable
us to deliver long term value to ourstakeholders. At the same time, weremain vigilant in mitigating the risksthat may come with changes in ourexternal environment.

SGX is keen to do our part to minimiseour environmental footprint whilstmanaging our commercial needs.
Since the formalisation oftheEnvironmental Policy1 in FY2016,
which encompasses both our direct andindirect impacts on energy consumptionand other natural resources, SGX
has undertaken further initiatives topromote environmental responsibilityand reduce our environmental footprint,
In FY2017, SGX made available the
use of electronic statements for retailinvestors. All nine retail securitiesbrokers in Singapore and The CentralDepository have progressively providedelectronic statements to customers sincethe fourth quarter of 2016. This move, inline with the drive towards a paper-lessand sustainable workplace, also offerscustomers convenience and secure
and timely delivery oftheir accountstatements, trade contract details andconﬁrmations of securities movements.
SGX also announced the move
towards electronic transmission ofshareholder documents with effectfrom March 2017. This was in responseto positive feedback received from publicconsultation regarding e-communication.
We will give issuers the ﬂexibility
to decide on the most appropriateeicommunication regime to adopt fortheir shareholder base. In support of thisinitiative, SGX is doing away with mailingout CDs for our current annual reportand will write to shareholders to explainthat the same information is availableon ourwebsitev Physical copies of ourannual report will be made availableupon request.
Our primary data centre has beenawarded the Singapore Standard 564($5564) certiﬁcation for Green DataCentre — Energy& EnvironmentalManagement Systems. 88564 wasdeveloped by the IDA in partnershipwith various government agencies toset a Singapore Standard for Green DataCentres. Our new, secondary data centrewas awarded BCA Green Mark Platinumcertiﬁcation for excellence in Energy andEnvironmental Design ofthe Building.
These efforts exemplify SGX’s efforts tomanage energy usage and have resultedin an overall improvement in energyconsumption by 10%.
SGX continues to measure ourprogress against targets, and driveimprovements for environmentally-friendly resource usage.

Board Composition and GuidancePRINCIPLE 2
Board Independence
The SFR 2005 provides that anindependent director is one who isindependent from any managementand business relationship with SGXand independent from any substantialshareholder of 56X 7 out of9 directorsare considered independent.
The Board. taking into account theviews ofthe NGC, the nature and scopeof SGX’S businesses and the number
of Board committees. considers that aboard with a majority of members beingindependent is necessary.
Over the course ofthe year. the NGCassessed the independence of Boardmembers in compliance with therequirements ofthe SFR 2005 andtook into consideration the relevantguidelines ofthe CCG 2012. Withregard to Guideline 2.4 ofthe CCG 2012which requires that the independenceofany director, who has served on
the Board beyond 9 years from thedate of ﬁrst appointment be subject
to particularly rigorous review. theNGC decided that any independentdirector upon completing 9 consecutiveyears of service will thereafter bedeemed a non-independent director,notwithstanding demonstrableindependence of management, orbusiness relationships with SGX or anysubstantial shareholder. The Board is inaccord with the NGC's decision.
Board Composition and Size
Each year, the NGC reviews thecomposition and size ofthe Board andeach Board committee and the skillsand core competencies of its membersto ensure an appropriate balance
and diversity of skills and experience.Core competencies include banking.ﬁnance, accounting, business acumen,
50
management experience, exchangeindustry knowledge, familiarity withregulatory requirements and knowledgeof risk management. The NGC also takesinto account gender diversity in relationto the composition ofthe Board. Out
of 9 directors, 3 are female. The Board,
taking into account the views of the NGC,
considers that its directors possess thenecessan/ competencies and knowledgeto lead and govern SGX effectively,

Board Guidance
An effective and robust Board,
whose members engage in open andconstructive debate and challengemanagement on its assumptions andproposals. is fundamental to goodcorporate governance. A Board shouldalso aid in the development of strategicproposals and oversee effectiveimplementation by management toachieve set objectives.
For this to happen, the Board, inparticular its Non-Executive Directors(NEDs). must be kept well informed ofSGX's businesses and be knowledgeableabout the exchange industnjt To
ensure that NEDs are well supported
by accurate, complete and timely
information, NEDs have unrestrictedaccess to management. NEDs alsoreceive periodic information papers andboard brieﬁngs 0n the latest marketdevelopments and trends, and keybusiness initiatives. Regular informalmeetings are held for management tobrief directors on prospective deals andpotential developments in the earlystages, before formal Board approval issought Board papers are provided todirectors not less than a week in advanceofthe meeting to afford the directorssufﬁcient time to review the boardpapers priorto the meeting. If a directoris unable to attend a Board or Boardcommittee meeting, the director maynevertheless provide his/her commentsto the Chairman or relevant Boardcommittee Chairman separately.

Separation ofthe Role of Chairmanand the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO)The roles of Chairman ofthe Boardand CEO are separate to ensure a
clear division of responsibilities.increased accountability and greatercapacity of the Board for independentdecision»making. The Chairman andthe CEO are not related. The division ofresponsibilities and functions betweenthe two has been demarcated with theconcurrence ofthe Board.
The Chairman manages the business ofthe Board and monitors the translationof the Board’s decisions and directionsinto executive action. He approves theagendas forthe Board meetings andensures sufﬁcient allocation oftime forthorough discussion of each agendaitem. He promotes an open environmentfor debate, and ensures that NEDs areable to speak freely and contributeeffectively. He exercises control over thequality and qua ntity of the informationas well as the timeliness of the ﬂow ofinformation between the Board and
Corporate Governance
management. In addition, he providesclose oversight, guidance, advice andleadership to the CEO and management.
AtAGMs and other shareholders
meetings, the Chairman plays a pivotal rolein fostering constructive dialogue betweenshareholders, the Board and management.
The CEO manages and develops thebusinesses of SGX and implements theBoard's decisions. He chairs the EMCO,which comprises senior managementexecutives. EMCO meets weekly tooversee the management ofthe SGXgroup and implement the Board’sstrategic policies.
Board interaction with, and independentaccess to, senior management isencouraged. EMCO members are invitedto attend all Board meetings andrelevant Board committee meetings.
Given that the roles of the Chairmanand CEO are separate and the Chairmanis independent. no Lead IndependentDirector is required to be appointed.

The Board, in conjunction with the NGC.reviews the composition of the Board andBoard committees annually, taking intoaccount the performa nce and contributionof each individual director.

Based on the NGC's assessment of theindependence ofeach individual directorand his or her relevant expertise, andwith the aim of ensuring compliancewith the requirements of the CCG 2012and SFR 2005, the Board reviews,
and reconstitutes as appropriate. themembership ofthe Board committees.
The Articles provide that at each AGM.one-third ofthe directors, including theCEO who also serves on the Board (or,iftheir number is not a multiple of 3.the number nearest to but not less thanone-third) shall retire from ofﬁce byrotation‘ Effectively. this results in alldirectors having to retire at least once

(b) whether his/herappointmentwill result in noncompliance withany ofthe SFR 2005 compositionrequirements forthe Board and itsBoard committees; and
(c) whether the candidate fulﬁls theﬁt and proper criteria undertheMAS' ﬁt and properguidelineswhich include, honesty, integrity,reputation, competence andcapability, and ﬁnancial soundness.
All directors ofSGX are approved bytheMAS. based on its ﬁt and proper criteria,before they are appointed by the Boardor at the AGM (as the case may be).
Continuous Reviewof Directors' IndependenceThe NGC conducts an annual review
of each director's independence
in accordance with the SFR 2005requirements and takes into considerationthe relevant guidelines in the CCG 2012.SGX has procedures in place to ensurecontinuous monitoring of SGX directorsindependence. The NGC has ascertainedthat save for Mr Loh Boon Chye and
Ms Lim Sok Hui, all directors areconsidered independent according tothese criteria. Ifat any time MAS is notsatisﬁed that a director is independent.notwithstanding any determination bythe NGC, MAS may direct SGX to rectifythe composition ofthe Board or Boardcommittees (as the case may be).
SGX has in place a policy whereby directorsmust consult both the Chairman of theBoard and the NGC Chairman priortoaccepting new director appointments.Directors must also immediately report anychanges in their external appointments,including any corporate developmentsrelating to their external appointments,which may affect their independence.This ensures directors continuallymeetthe stringent requirements ofindependence under the SFR 2005.
Directors’ Time Commitments
The NGC assesses the effectiveness ofthe Board as a whole and takes intoaccount each director's contributionand devotion 0ftime and attention toSGX. The NGC also assesses nomineesidentiﬁed for recommendation to theBoard, on their individual credentials andtheir ability to devote appropriate timeand attention to SGX.
The NGC is of the view that theeffectiveness of each of the directorsis best assessed by a qualitativeassessment of the director'scontributions as well as by taking intoaccount each director's listed companyboard directorships, and any otherrelevant time commitments. Whilehaving a numerical limit on the numberof directorships may be considered by

the adequacy of mitigation plans.Compliance focuses on compliance
risks and works with Enterprise RiskManagement and the operating units
to mitigate these risks. Internal Audit,
as the third line of defence, providesobjective assurance to the AC. Together,these 3 lines of defence assure that thereare adequate internal controls relating toprocesses, risk and control governance.
SGX has implemented an enterprise-wide risk management framework tofacilitate the management of risks acrossthe organisation.
SGX recognises the importance ofbalancing risks and rewards to achievethe optimal level of risk that SGX cantolerate in its pursuit of its strategicpriorities and business opportunities, Inthis regard, the Board has established aRiskAppetite Statement to identifythereturn objectives that are imperative tothe organisation and the correspondingrisk boundaries that are acceptable
to support the achievement 0ftheseobjectives. This stated understandingbetween the Board and Managementaligns SGX's risk proﬁle with its businessobjectives and helps bring discipline
as Management drives strategy withinthe established risk boundaries. It alsoreinforces SGX’s risk culture through theestablishment of a “tone from the topregarding the nature and extent of risksthat SGX is willing to accept.
There are 3 programs in place for theorganisation to identify, assess andmanage risks faced by SGX. The ﬁrstprogram adopts a topadown approach,where key risks including strategic,
58
ﬁnancial, operational, compliance andregulatory risks, are identiﬁed by seniormanagement. Mitigating actions are
put in place to manage these risks, andkey risk indicators (KRI) are establishedto monitorthe risks. These KRIs areapproved bythe RMC and the Board.The second program, the unit»|eve| “RiskSelfAssessments, adopts a bottomaupapproach and allows individual units tocontinuously identify risks faced by theirunits. Similar to the top-down exercise,mitigating actions are formulated tomanage the risks. The third program is
a “Control Self-Assessment programwhich provides objective assurance tothe CEO and his management team thatkey controls are operating effectively.The units are required to performselfatesting to verify that key controlsoperated effectively th roughout theyear, Together, all these tools andexercises provide greater assurancethat the SGX group’s risks identiﬁed areadequately managed, Where deﬁcienciesin controls are identiﬁed, the operatingunits are able to address and rectify suchdeﬁciencies in a timely manner‘
The Board has received assurance fromthe CEO and CFO on the SGX group'sﬁnancial records and the effectivenessof SGX’s risk management and internalcontrols. The Board also receives aseparate quarterly representation onSGX's ﬁnancial information and controls,including that the ﬁnancial records
have been properly maintained and theﬁnancial statements give a true and fairview ofthe SGX group's operations andﬁnances, from the CEO and CFO.
SGX engages in Business ContinuityManagement (BCM) to minimise
the impact ofa disruption 0n SGX'soperations. As a majorﬁnancial industryinfrastructure provider, SGX has anobligation to ensure the continuity of itsbusiness as any operational disruptionmay cause adverse impact on theﬁnancial industry. SGX's BCM Policy and
Guidelines ensure business continuityplanning and staffreadiness by way ofregular rehea rsals, exercising and testing.
SGX's system of internal controls andrisk management provides reasonableassurance against foreseeable eventsthat may adversely affect SGX's businessobjectives. The Board notes that nosystem ofinternal controls and riskmanagement can provide absoluteassurance in this regard, or against theoccurrence of material errors, poorjudgement in decisionrmaking, humanerror, losses, fraud or other irregularities.
Based on the internal controlsestablished and maintained by SGX,work performed by the internal
and external auditors, and reviewsperformed by management and variousBoard Committees, the Board, with therecommendation ofthe AC. is of theopinion that SGX's internal controls andrisk management systems, addressingﬁnancial, operational. compliance
and information technology risks,
are adequate and effective as of
30 June 2017.
On 14 July 2016, SGX’s securities marketexperienced a market disruption whenthe exchange ceased trading at 11.38amand remained closed for the rest oftheday. The disruption was caused by adisk failure and an application that didnot detect the problem The disruptionwas prolonged due to challenges in theorders and trade reconciliation process.In addition to SGX‘s own immediatemeasures to address the incident. SGXconvened a Securities Industry WorkingGroup (IWG) with representatives fromSGX and industry stakeholders.

Short-term incentives take the formofan annual variable bonus for allemployees excluding those participatingin the sales incentive plan, who willreceive sales incentive payment basedon the achievement of sales targets.Each year, the RSDC reviews andapproves the variable bonus pool
for distribution. The Managementreviews and allocates variable bonusbased on the individual performanceof employees and their contributionstowards SGX’s performance The
sales incentive pool is determined bythe achievement of sales targets anddistributed to employees based on theachievement of team and individualsales targets and corporate objectives.
Long-term incentives (LTls) create valuefor the company by aligning employees’longeterm incentives to the achievementof SGX’s Iong-term results. Furthermore,due to its time-based vestingcharacteristic. it carries a retentionelement that strengthens SGX's ability toreward and retain key employees.
In alignment with current regulatorystandards. LTIs may be clawed back inthe event of exceptional circumstancesof misstatement ofﬁnancial results or ofmisconduct resulting in ﬁnancial or otherlosses to the company.
There are two types of LTls — the
SGX Performance Share Plan and theSGX Deferred Long-Term IncentivesScheme and the grants ofwhich aremade at the discretion ofthe RSDC.Forthe senior management, half oftheir deferred variable compensation isgranted in performance shares underthe SGX Performance Share Plan and
68
the remaining half in deferred sharesunderthe Deferred Long-Term IncentivesScheme. The number ofshares awardedis determined using the valuation oftheshares based on one-month volume-weighted average prices ofSGX Sharesbefore the approval ofawards.
The total incentives pool funds theannual variable bonus for all employees(excluding those in control functions
and on the sales incentive plan) and theIong-term incentive plans, It is computedusing the following formula:
Total Incentives (TI) Pool = A percentageof [Proﬁt before Variable Bonus lessCorporate Tax less Cost of Equity]

Front-line Regulatory activities
SGX conducts rigorous realtime surveillance of trading activities to promote orderly trading anddetect any undesirable market conduct. Where there is any indication ofanomalous trading,we will issue a public query to the listed company to see if it has unannounced materialinformation that could explain the trading activity. We issued 173 public queries this year,
For potential breaches of the law, SGX works with the releva ntagencies and authoritiesto take appropriate action. This helps inpreserving the integrity ofour market We referred 34 cases tothe authorities during the year.
in FY2017, S TRs were charged before the SGX-ST DisciplinaryCommittee for market misconduct. Two of the TRs wereinvolved in pre-arranging cross trades of signiﬁcant volumeamongst their clients, which created a false or misleadingappearance ofactive trading in several counters. The two TRswere ﬁned between S$60,000 and S$70,000, and suspendedfor two to three months respectively. The remaining three TRs,who worked as a team. collectively created a false market in aparticular counter by executing extensive cross trades amongsttheir clients to artiﬁcially maintain the share price. The threeTRs were ﬁned an aggregate of S$250.000 and suspended forbetween 3 and 6 months each.
An Individual Trading Member (TMI) was also charged beforethe SGX-DT Disciplinary Committee for engaging in spooﬁngactivity in several futures contracts, He was ﬁned S$200.000and expelled as a TMI 0f SGXVDT. This was the ﬁrst disciplinaryproceeding on market misconduct since trading in thederivatives market became fully automated in 2006.

the LAC as SGX was ofthe view thatthe various fund-raising transactions, inparticular, the share swap, was novel.
The second referral case reviewed
by the LAC in August and September2016 involved a business trust listingapplicant with overseas portfolio assetsin an industry which was subject toforeign ownership restrictions. Thebusiness trust, being a foreigner in thisoverseasjurisdiction, was not permittedto have its shareholdings in the entitiesholding the assets exceed the maximumprescribed limit allowed for foreigners.The business trust held the assetsthrough a highly complex ownershipstructure whereby the business trust'seconomic interest in the assets wouldfar exceed its shareholding interests:such stark disparity between economicand shareholding interests had not beenobserved in other SGX»|isted businesstrusts. The listing application wasreferred to the LAC as SGX was of theview that a referral was appropriate,
In both referral cases, the LAC wasconcerned about retail investors havingdifﬁculty in understanding the complexnature and terms ofthe transactionsor ownership structures. The LACSrecommendations included requiringthe listing applicants to incorporate
the relevant health warnings and cleardisclosures in the prospectuses.

the LAC. We had, where appropriate,recommended prospectus disclosure oncertain issues
During the ﬁnancial year ending
30 June 2016, the LAC had advised
on SGX's proposed listing frameworkfor dualeclass share structures. The LAChad recommended that dual-class sharestructures be permitted to list on SGXsubject to appropriate safeguards setout in the LACS ﬁrst annual report.
The LAC‘s advice was reported by bothlocal and foreign media. It attractedlively debate from both supporters and
detractors of dualrclass share structures.
During my engagement with the localmedia in September 2016 in connectionwith the LAC's ﬁrst anniversary, [tookthe opportunity to reiterate that asSGX has no natural hinterland providinga pipeline of listings. permitting listingofdual-class share structures is that“something extra which SGX canofferto compete internationally.
The LAC is heartened to note that theCommittee on the Future Economy.having recognised that dualrclassshare structures are increasingly beingconsidered by companies in industriessuch as information technology

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR'S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF SINGAPORE EXCHANGE LIMITED
As part of designing our audit, we determined materiality and assessed the risks of material misstatement in the accompanyingfinancial statements. In particular, we considered where management made subjectivejudgements; for example, in respect ofsignificant accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain.As in aii of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls. including among other mattersconsideration of whether there was evidence of bias that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud.
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. An audit is designed to obtain reasonable assurancewhether the financial statements of the Group are free from material misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud orerror. They are considered material if individually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economicdecisions of users taken on the basis of the financial statements of the Group.
Based on our professional judgement, we determined certain quantitative thresholds for materiality, These, together withqualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our auditprocedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and in aggregate, on the ﬁnancial statements as
a whoie. We determined overall materiality for the financial statements 0fthe Group as a whole to be $20 million (roundeddown to the nearest million), being 5% of profit before tax. We chose profit before tax as the benchmark because, in our view,it reflects the underlying performance of the Group and it is one of the benchmarks that is commonly used by the users offinancial statements in evaluating the performance of the Groups In performing our audit. we allocated materiality levels, whichare less than the overall group materiality, to the significant components.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above $1 millionas well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view. warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Audit Scope
We tailored the scope of our audit in order to perform sufficient work to enable us to provide an opinion on the financialstatements of the Group as a whole. taking into account the structure ofthe Group. the accounting processes and controls andthe industry in which the Group operates. The Group’s financial reporting process is dependent on its IT systems. Our auditscope included testing the operating effectiveness of the controls over the integrity of key financial data processed through theIT systems that are relevant to financial reporting.
We audited the complete financial information of the Company and each of the significant components This, together with theaudit procedures performed at the Group level over group consolidation, goodwiii, intangible asset, taxation and disclosures inthe financial statements, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professionaljudgement, were of most significance in our audit of the financialstatements for the financial year ended 30 June 2017. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financialstatements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
