FAIR VALUE OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTSFinancial instruments whose carrying amount approximates fair value
Management has determined that the carrying amounts of cash and cash equivalents, current trade and other receivables,loan receivable, amounts due from subsidiaries, loan to subsidiaries and associate, current trade and other payables, amounts dueto subsidiary, and current loans and borrowings reasonably approximate their fair values because these are mostly short-term innature or are repriced frequentlyto market interest rates.
The estimated fairvalues of the Group’s loans and borrowings approximate their carrying amounts based on borrowing rates whichwould be availableto the Company at the end of each reporting period
Non-financial asset and liability whose carrying amounts approximate fair values
Management has determined that the carrying amount of the assets and liabilities of disposal group heldeforesale reasonablyapproximate its fair value because theyare mostly short-term in nature or are repriced frequently to market interest rates.
FAIR VALUE OF ASSETS AND LIABILITIES(a) Fair value hierarchy
The Group categories fairvalue measurements using a fairvalue hierarchythat is dependent on the valuation inputs used asfollows:
- Level 1 ~ Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at themeasurement date;
- LevelZ - Inputs other that quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,either directly or indirectly; and
- Leve|3 - Unobservableinputsfortheassetorliability.
Fairvalue measurements that use inputs of different hierarchy levels are categorised in its entirety in the 83 me level of the fairvalue hierarchy as the lowest level input that is significant to the entire measurement.

Dear Fellow Shareholders.
The Year2017 in Summary
The year 2017 proved to be a challenging year for manybusinesses operating within the personal computer (PC) andhard disk drive (HDD) industries, as worldwide demand for newpersonal computers and data storage devices remained stagnant,and global product shipment numbers continued to be weekthroughout the year. We also saw industry consolidation andcapacity rationalization taking place throughout the supply chains
Ongoing market weakness and underutilized capacity among thecomponent suppliers also resulted in intensified price pressure,in addition to periodic cost discounts being called for by the endcustomers.
Perhaps the only silver lining in the HDD industry remains in the formof “Enterprise storage, with the increasing popularity of on the go“cloud” storage solution demanded by users of mobile phones andpersonal digital devices, who are looking for higher definition andquality in theirvideo recordings and photo resolutions. This segmentof the data storage industry, while currently accounting for perhapsless than 15% of total market, is seeing rising potential with everincreasing speed and dropping cost of internet access, This methodof data storage, which uses enterprise grade storage servers,with very large storage capacity, and high speed, utilizing multipleunits of enterprise grade hard disk drives within each server, maycontinue to see growing demands
With the shifting industry trends and changing end user demands,businesses operating within HDD industry will need to adapt tochanges in customer requirements, in order to remain relevant andensure business survival‘ Amid facing a competitive landscape ofever intensifying price pressure from not just peers, but also fromalternative storage medium like flash memory, suppliers need tocontinue to upgrade product quality and capabilities to remaincompetitive and relevant.
Thechanging supply chain landscapealso seesdrive manufacturersand component manufacturers increasingly relocating theirproduction facilities from China, which is facing fast risingcosts, to South East Asian countries like Thailand and Malaysia.

INDEPENDENTAUDITOR'S REPORT
FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2017
Key audit matters (cont'd)Valuation of buildings and improvements
We refer to Note 2.7 (Significant accounting policies), Note 3.20 (Signiﬁcant accounting judgments and estimates) and Note 12(Property, plant and equipment)
At 31 December 2017, buildings and improvements stated at fairvaluation amou nted to $80 million, Management engaged an independentprofessional valuer (“External Appraiser) during the year to determine the fair value of the buildings and improvements. The ExternalAppraiser determined the fairvalues based on the direct comparison approach, using sales and listing of similar properties in the vicinity asguides to value after relevant adjustments were made for differences in characteristics of the buildings and improvements such as location,land area, conditions of the buildings and improvements,
Thevaluation 0f the buildings and improvements wassignificanttotheaudit dueto its magnitude, and it involved significant level ofjudgmentand estimates made by the management and the External Appraiser. Hence, we consider this to be a key audit matter.
As part of our audit procedures, we evaluated the objectivity, independence and expertise of the External Appraisers. From the externalvaluation report obtained, we discussed with the external appraisers and further assessed the appropriateness of the basis and approachadopted for the valuation and the key assumptions, such as size adjustment factor and replacement cost rate, used by the external appraiserin determining its valuation forthe buildings and improvements. We involved our internal valuation specialist to assist us in the evaluation ofthe appropriateness of the valuation model and certain key assumptions and estimates used. Furthermore, we assessed the appropriatenessof the disclosures in Note 34 to the financial statements relating to the sensitivity of the key assumptions.
Other information
Management is responsible for other information. The other information comprises the information included in the annual report, but doesnot include the financial statements and our auditor’s report thereon‘
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express any form of assurance conclusionthereont
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, consider whetherthe other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears tobe materially misstated If, based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this other information,we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.

Going Forward
Industry analysts remained subdued in their forecasts for PCand HDD industries for the upcoming financial year The Groupcontinues to make active efforts to increase market share in thisimportant customer segment, and to take part in qualifying for newcustomer programs. At the same time, we continue to upgradeproduct quality and capability so that we may strengthen ourleadership position and keep pace with the latest technologicaldevelopment and product trends, The Group also underta kes furthersteps in cost monitoring, against a backdrop of rising raw materialand energy prices, and works on greater operational efficiency andproductivity, These efforts have been instrumental in helping theGroup remaining a major player in this market
Producing extrusions for the HDD industry has been the corebusiness for the Group Over the years, the Group has facedweaker customer orders and intensifying competition, whichresulted in escalating price pressures and lower profitability.In view of the challenging demands by customers of the Group'score business, the Group believes that it is important to reviewother business opportunities and strategies to generate additionalrevenue streams, reduce reliance on existing business and toenhance shareholders‘ value. On 8 August 201 7, we announced asubscription agreement We believe, if the proposed subscriptionis passed at the EGM, the new Shareholder, New Impetus StrategyFund (NISF) will bring AEI Corp into another dimension by investingin infrastructure businesses (more information can be found inthe circular to shareholders) and hopefully become a bigger,diversified and profitable company.

As part of an audit in accordance with SSAS, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughout theaudit We also:
' Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement ofthe financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and performaudit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for ouropinion.The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higherthan for one resulting from error, as fraud mayinvolve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
‘ Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in thecircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness ofthe Group's internal controlt
‘ Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosuresmade by management.
- Conclude 0n the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidenceobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group's abilityto continue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor'sreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements or. if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinionOur conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor's report. However. future events or conditionsmay cause the Group to cease to continue as a going concern

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Standards issued but not yet effective (cont’d)FRS 1 09 Financial Instruments
FRS 109 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of ﬁnancial assets, impairment of financial assets andhedge accounting Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the business modelunder which they are held. The impairment requirements in FRS 109 are based on an expected credit loss model and replace theFRS 39 incurred loss model
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 109 based on currently available information.This assessment may be subject to changes arising from ongoing analysis, until the Group adopts FRS 109 in 201 St
Impairment
FR8109 requiresthe Group to record expected credit losses on all of its loans and trade receivables, eitheron a 12-month or lifetimebasis. The Group expects to apply the simpliﬁed approach and record lifetime expected losses on all loans and trade receivables.Based on the Group’s preliminary impact assessment of adopting FRS 109, it is expected that the application of expected credit lossmodel would not have a significant impact to the Group's financials. The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the requiredeffective date without restating prior period's information,
FRS 116 Leases
FRS116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reflect the rig hts to use the leased assets and the associatedobligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciation Charges. The standard includes tworecognition exemptions for lessees - leases of ‘Iow value' assets and short—term leases. The new standard is effective for annualperiods beginning on or after1 January 2019.
The Group has performed a preliminary impact assessment of the adoption of FRS 1 1Band expectsthattheadoption ofFRS 116 mayresult in increase in total assets and total liabilities, EBITDA and gearing ratio,
The Group plans to adopt the new standard on the required effective date by applying FRS 116 retrospectively with the cumulativeeffect of initial application as an adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as at 1 January 2019.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the end of thereporting period. The financial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements areprepared for the same reporting date as the Company. Consistent accounting policies are applied to like transactions and events insimilar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expensesand unrealised gainsand losses resultingfrom intra-grouptransactionsand dividendsare eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue to beconsolidated until the datethat such control ceases.
Losses within a subsidiaryare attributed to the nonicontrolling interest even if that results in a deficit balance
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction If the Grouploses control over a subsidiaw, it:
- de—recognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date whencontrol is lost;
- de-recognises the Gaming amount of any non-controlling interest;
- de-recognises the cumulative tra nslation differences recorded in equity;
- recognises the fair value of the consideration received;
- recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
» recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
» reclassifies the Group's share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss orretained earnings, as appropriate.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Transactions with nan-contmlling interestsNonicontrolling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company.
Changes in the Company's ownership interest in a subsidiaw that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equitytransactions. In such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and nonicontrolling interests are adjusted to reflect thechanges in their relative interests in the subsidiary Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest isadjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of theCompany
Fareign currency
The financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars, which is also the Company's functional currency. Each entity in theGroup determines its own fu notional currency and items included in the fine ncial statements of each entity are measured using thatfunctional currency,
(8) Transactions and balancesTransactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiariesand are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at thetransaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchangeruling at the end of the reporting period Non—monetary itemsthat are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currencyare translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair valuein a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising 0n the settlement of monetary items or on tra nslating monetary items at the end of the reportingperiod are recognised in profit or loss‘
(b) Consolidated financial statements
For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into SGD at the rate of exchangeruling at the end of the reporting period and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange rates prevailing at the date ofthe transactions The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income.On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating to that particularforeign operationis recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Property, plan! and equipmentAll items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost Subsequent to recognition, plant and equipment and furniture
and fixtures other than buildings and improvements are measured at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulatedimpairment losses.
Buildings and improvements are measured at fair value less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses recognised afterthedate ofthe revaluation. Valuations are performed with sufficient regularityto ensure that the carrying amount does not differ materiallyfrom the fairvalue of the buildings and improvements at the end of the reporting period
Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity under the asset revaluation reserve,except to the extent that it reverses a revaluation decrease of the sa me asset previously recognised in profit or loss. in which case theincrease is recognised in profit or loss. A revaluation deﬁcit is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it offsets an existingsurplus on the same asset carried in the asset revaluation reserve,
Any accumulated depreciation as at the revaluation date is eliminated against the gross carrying amount of the asset and the netamount is restated t0 the revalued amount ofthe assets The revaluation surplus included in the asset revaluation reserve in respectof an asset is transferred directly to retained earnings on retirement or disposal of the asset.
Depreciation is computed on a straight—Iine basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets as follows:
- Buildings and improvements the remaining lease periods of 18 to 255 years
- Plantand machinery - 10to 20 years~ Renovation » 4 to 5 years
- Motor vehicles - 5 to 10 years~ Furniture andfittings » 3t010years- Office equipment - 3 to 10 years- Dies and moulds - 6.7 years
Assets under construction included in plant and equipment are not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.
The carrying values of property, plantand equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicatethat the carrying value may not be recoverable.
The residual value, useful life and depreciation method are reviewed at each financial year—end, and adjusted prospectively,if appropriate.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal orwhen no future economic benefits are expected from itsuse or disposals Any gain or loss on deirecognition of the asset is included in profit or loss in the year the asset is derecognised.

Leasehold land is initially measured at cost Following initial recognition, leasehold land is measured at cost less accumulatedamortisation The leasehold land is amortised on a straight—Iine basis over the lease term of21.4 years
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired If any indication exists,or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.
An asset's recoverable amount is the higher of an asset's or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal and its value inuse and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂowsthat are largely independent of thosefrom other assets or groups of assets, Where the carrying amount of an asset or cashsgenerating unit exceeds its recoverableamount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount.
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss, except forassets that are previously revalued wheretherevaluation was taken to other comprehensive income, In this case, the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensiveincome up to the amount of any previous revaluation.
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the asset'srecoverable amount since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount ofthe asset is increasedto its recoverable amount, That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation,had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss unless the asset is measured atrevalued amount, in which case the reversal istreated as a revaluation increase.
Subsidiaries
A subsidiaiy is an investee that is controlled bythe Grou p. The Group controlsan investee when it is exposed, or has rights, to varia blereturns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
In the Company's separate fi na ncial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accou nted for at cost less impairment losses.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions of theinvestee but does not have control orjoint control of those policies.
The Group account for its investments in associates using the equity method from the date on which it becomes an associate.
On acquisition of the investment, any excess of the cost of the investment overthe Grou p‘s share of the net fair value of the investee'sidentifiable assets and lie bilities is accounted as goodwill and is included in the canying amount of the investment Any excess 0ftheGroup's share of the net fair value of the investee's identifiable assets and liabilities over the cost of the investment is included asincome in the determination of the entity’s share of the associate‘s profit or loss in the period in which the investment is acquired
Under the equity method, the investment in associates are carried in the balance sheet at cost plus postacquisition changes in theGroup’s share of net assets of the associates. The profit or loss reflects the share of results of the operations of the associates.Distributions received from associates reduce the carrying amount of the investment. Where there has been a change recognised inother comprehensive income by the associates, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensive incomeUnrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and associate are eliminated to the extent of the interestin the associates,
When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognisefurther losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate.
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessaryto recognise an additional impairment loss onthe Group's investment in associate The Group determines at the end of each reporting period whether there is any objectiveevidence that the investment in the associate is impaired. If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as thedifference between the recoverable amount 0fthe associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in proﬁt or loss.
The financial statements of the associates are prepared as the same reporting date as the Com pa ny. Where necessa ry, adjustmentsare made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group

Financial assetsInitial recogn/t/on and measurement
Financial assets are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of thefinancial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of financial assets not at fairvalue through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurementLoans and receive bles
Non»derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified asloans and receivables. Subsequent to initial recognition, loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using theeffective interest method, less impairment Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the loans and receivablesare derecognised or impaired, and through the amortisation process.
De-recognit/on
A ﬁnancial asset is derecognised where the contractual right to receive cash flows from the asset has expired.On de—recognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of theconsideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive income isrecognised in profit or loss.
Financ ial Iia bilitiesInitial recognit/on and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of theﬁnancial instrument. The Group determines the classification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profitor loss, directly attributable transaction costs.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)
Financial instruments (can f’d)
(b) Financial liabilities (con t’d)DearecognitionA financial liability is dearecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When anexisting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of anexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a dearecognition of the original
liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in profit orloss.
Impairment of financial assetsThe Group assesses at each end of the reporting period whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired.
Financial assets carried at amortised cost
For financial assets carried at amortised cost. the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment existsindividually for financial assets that are individually significant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individually significant.It the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financial asset, whethersignificant or not, it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics and collectively assessesthem for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairment loss is, or continues to berecognised are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amount ofthe loss is measured as the difference between the asset's carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flowsdiscounted at the ﬁnancial asset’s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuringany impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowa nceaccount. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss,
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the carrying amount of impaired financial asset is reduced directly or if an amount wascharged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowance account are written off against the carrying value of thefinancial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on fine ncial assets has been incurred, the Group considersfactors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significant delay inpayments
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related objectively to an eventoccurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that the carryingamount of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The amount of reversal is recognised in profit or loss.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand and ﬁxed deposits in banks which are subject to an insignificant riskof changes in value.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realise ble value Costs incurred in bringing the inventories to their present locationand condition are accounted for as follows:
— Raw materials: purchase costs on a weighted average cost basis;
, Finished goods and workainaprogress: costs of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheadsbased on normal operating capacity. These costs are assigned on a weighted average cost basis.
Where necessary, allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow moving items to adjust the carrying value of inventories tothe lower of cost and net realisable value.
Net realisablevalue isthe estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and estimatedcosts necessary to ma ke the sale.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probablethat an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amount of the obligationcan be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is no longer probablethat an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed, If the effect of the time valueof money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre-tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risks specific to theliability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage oftime is recognised as a finance cost.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cost of a qualifying asset if they are directly attribute ble to the acquisition, constructionor production of that asset. Ca pitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the asset for its intended useor sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred Borrowing costs are capitalised until the assets aresubstantially completed for their intended use or sale. All other borrowing costs are expensed in the period they occur.Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowing of funds.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)Employee beneﬁtsDeﬁned contribution plan
The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the laws of the countries in which it has operations.In particular, the Singapore companies in the Group make contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore, a
defined contribution pension scheme. Contributionsto defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in theperiod in which the related service is performed.
Employee leave entitlement
Employee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a lie bility when they accrue to employees The estimated liability for leaveis recognised for services rendered by employees up to the end of the reporting period
Leas as
Finance leases which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leased item,are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fairvalue of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum leasepayments Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised. Lease payments are apportioned between the financecharges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.Finance charges are charged to profit or loss, Contingent rents, if any, are charged as expenses in the periods in which they areincurred.
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term, if there is noreasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the lease term. The aggregatebenefit of incentives provided bythe lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense overthe lease term on a straight-line basis.
Assets held for sale and discontinued opera tions
Assets and disposal groups classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs tosell. Assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amounts will be recovered principally through a saletransaction rather than through continuing use. A component of the Group is classified as a ‘discontinued operation' when thecriteria to be classified as held for sale have been met or it has been disposed of and such a component represents a separate majorline of business or geographical area of operations or is part of a single coordinated plan to dispose of a separate major line ofbusiness or geographical area of operations.
Property, plant and equipment and intangible assets once classified as held for sale are not depreciated oramortised.

that is not a business combination and, atthetime of the transaction, affects neitherthe accounting profit nor taxableprofit or loss; and
In respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests injoint ventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable thatthe temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it isno longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at the end of each reporting period and are recognised to the extent that ithas become probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the year when the asset isrealised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the endof each reporting period.

SUMMARY OF SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES (CONT’D)contingenciesA contingent liability is:
(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence ornonioccurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:(i) It is not probable that an outflow of resources em bodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufficient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arisesfrom past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by the occurrence ornon-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group,
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilities assumed in abusiness combination that are present obligations and which the fairvalues can be reliably determined.
SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES
The preparation of the Group's consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates andassumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and lie bilities, and the disclosure of contingent Iia bilitiesat the end of each reporting period, Uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that require amaterial adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in the future periods,
Judgments made in applying accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group's accounting policies, management has made the following judgements which have the mostsignificant effect on the amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements:
Taxes
Signiﬁcant judgment is involved in determining the group—wide provision for income taxes. There are certain transactions andcomputations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary course of business‘ The Group recognisesliabilities for expected tax issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due, Where the final tax outcome of thesematters is different from the amounts that were initially recognised, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred taxprovisions in the period in which such determination is made. The carrying amounts of the Group’s tax payables was $78,000(2016: $98000), while the deferred tax assets and liabilities at 31 December 2017 were $223,000 (2016: $Nil) and $195,000(2016: $1,244,000) respectively, The carrying amounts of the Company's tax payables and deferred tax liabilities at 31 December2017 were $78,000 (2016: $98,000) and $195,000 (2016: $772,000) respectively.

SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND ESTIMATES (CONT’D)Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of reporting period arediscussed below The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the financial statements wereprepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes orcircumstances arising beyond the control of the Group‘ Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
(a)
Impairment of non-financial assets
An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset or cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount, which isthe higher of its fairvalue less costs of disposal and its value in use. The fairvalue less costs of disposal calculation is basedon fair valuation of the assets less incremental costs for disposing the asset. The value in use calculation is based on adiscounted cash flow modeL The cash flows are derived from the budget for the next three years and do not includerestructuring activities that the Group is not yet committed to or significant future investments that will enhance the assetsperformance of the cash generating unit being tested‘ The recoverable amount is most sensitive tothe discount rate used forthe discounted cash flow model as well as the expected future cash inflows and the growth rate used for extrapolationpurposes,
Valuation of raw materials
The valuation ofthe Group's raw materials is assessed based on the best available facts and circumstances at the end of eachreporting period, including but not limited to, the inventories‘ own physical conditions, their expected market selling prices,external market data and estimated costs to be incurred for their sales. The value is re-evaluated and an impairment mig ht berecorded, if additional information received affects the amount initially assessed. The carrying amount of the raw materials asat 31 December 2017 iS $3,298,000 (2016: $3,388,000).
Valuation of buildings and improvements
The Group carries its buildings and improvements at fairvalue, with Changes in fair values being recognised in profit or loss,except to the extent that it offsets an existing surplus on the same asset carried in the asset revaluation reserve. The Groupengaged an independent professional valuer (“External Appraiser) to assess fair value as at 31 December 2017. The fairvalues of buildings and improvements are determined by an independent professional valuer using recognised valuationtechniques. These techniques comprise the direct comparison approach. The key assumptions used to determine the fairvalue of the buildings and improvements and sensitivity analysis are provided in Note 34‘
The carrying amount of the buildings and improvements carried at fair value as at 31 December 2017 is $8,000,000(2016: $14,221,000)
