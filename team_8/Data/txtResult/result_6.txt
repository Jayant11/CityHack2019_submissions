m fork back to f rm: helping customers meet consumer trends
Across the world, certain consumer trends in food are increasingly impacting our
customers' businesses.
We can classify these trends into 4 main categories, namely, quality, responsible sourcing, reliability and innovation.Food safety is non—negotiable and sustainability is becoming a pre—requisite as many customers have to meet theirown 2020 sustainability commitments‘ While there are still challenges over the cost of sustainable production, there isa strong opportunity to secure larger volume contracts. All these present new opportunities for Olam to differentiate
and lead.

Supply side trends, fragile ecosystems, naturaland social capital impacts
Natural Capital impacts
On the supply side however, constraints on the availabilityof both arable land and water is likely to creategrowing imbalances between supply and demand foragricultural crops Fragile ecological systems willexacerbate these supply side constraints. Agriculture,Forestry, and Other Land Use accounts for nearly 25%0f the world’s Greenhouse Gas (GHG) emissions‘.
Agriculture also accounts for 71% of all fresh waterwithdrawals? Nearly 1 million square miles of tropicalforest land could potentially be lost due to conversionof forests to food and feed production. Increasingdemand for deforestation-free products from keystakeholders is growing. We have significantlyexceeded the planetary boundary on biosphereintegrity or biodiversity by losing more than 1,000species for every million species yeartoday,compared to the boundary condition of not losing morethan 10 species for every million species years. As aresult, wild animal populations have roughly halvedSince 1970 and fragile ecosystems worldwide havebeen impacted by human activities. Clearly,businesses cannot function if ecosystems aredegraded or out of balance, as they provide manyinvisible but essential services, including regulation
of the climate and water cycle, air quality and floodprotection. Demand for additional water for irrigationis estimated to increase by nearly 28% by 2015, whileagriculture is estimated to contribute to more than 30%of all fresh water pollution“. Part of this pollution iscontributed by nitrogen and phosphate loading as webecome more input intensive in ourfarming activitiesto boost productivity. China today uses neaity 2.5 timesmore fertiliser per hectare as compared to Germany?The consequence is that 80% of all Chinese surfacewater (rivers and lakes) and underground aquifers arepolluted, in terms of their biological oxygen demandlevels (according to WHO).
In addition, nearly US$1 trillion of economic losses aresustained, as more than one third of all food producedin the world that is intended for human consumption islost or wasted at the point of production in developingcountries and at the point of consumption in thedeveloped regionss.
Social Capital impacts
The significant impacts of agriculture on social capital,including health and safety of workers given the use ofchemicals, machinery and the working environment,forced labour including child labour issues (given that60% of child labour worldwide is in the agriculturalsector), forced resettlement of communities including1. IPCC
2. Wortd Development Indicators3. Stockholm Resilience Centre4. UN Water
indigenous people and the impact on thesecommunities and their traditional livelihoods, are allkey social risks associated with modern agriculture.
In addition, rising production cost, workforce shortage.and ageing farmers pose significant additional risk inthe agrlcultural value chain.
Nutritional Challenges, with over 815 million people stillgoing to bed hungw every day (undernutrition), overnutrition issues With increasingly more people obesethan underweight, coupled with nearly 2 billion peoplesufferlng from various forms of malnutrition arising frommicronutnent and vitamin deficiencies, the highprevalence of stunting and wasting amongst youngchildren 1n developing countries, have all combined toincrease the incidence of chronic diseases and theattendant pressures on global health systems to treatthese adverse health impacts arising from a brokenglobal food system.
Dlam’s response
At a societal level, in addition to now supporting363,000 smallholder farmers under the
Olam Livelihood Charter, our teams continue to playtheir part in trying to prevent disease in communitiesaround our operations. Over 20,000 people in Africabenefitted from HlV/AIDS sensitisation, awarenessand testing as part of these efforts. The scale of ill
hea th in some communities such as those around
our orestry concessions in Republic of Congo meana far greater response is required than any onecompany can manage alone. Multi-stakeholderpartnerships as described under Goal 17 of the UNSus ainable Development Goals must take evengreater precedence. In this regard, we stepped upour collaboration initiatives in 2017 and forged
rela ionships, partnerships and alliances with NGOsand civil society, development agencies, multi-lateralsand customers including: Asian Development Bank(ADB), Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, BusinessSus ainabie Development Commission, Climate SmartAgriculture (CSA), Consultative Group for InternationalAgricultural Research (CGIAR), Costco, Food &Agriculture Organisation (FAO), Food Reform for
Sus ainability and Health (FReSH), GlobalAgribusiness Alliance (GAA), Global Coffee Platform,International Finance Corporation (IFC), HighConservation Value Resource Network (HCV), Mars,Mastercard Foundation, Nestle, Sustainable RicePlatform (SRP), The Nature Conservancy, The ForestsDialogue, The Deutsche Gesellschaft fUr InternationaleZusammenarbeit (GIZ), University of California (UCDavis), Wildlife Conservation Society (WCS), WorldBusiness Council for Sustainable Development(WBCSD), World Cocoa Foundation (WCF) and WorldResources Institute (WRI), amongst others.

Group CEO review continued
We have zero tolerance for lack of adherence to anyhuman rights violations and insist that the dignity of othersis respected in our operations both across our direct andindirect supply chains. We are committed to and workhard to ensure that the 10 principles of the UN GlobalCompact are upheld. A new cross commodity FairEmployment Policy will be issued later this year toreinforce our efforts in this regard. We have more work todo to ensure greater levels of diversity amongst our
employees, in particular increasing and better balancingthe number of women in senior management positionsin the company. While we can point to historical legacyreasons for up-oountry positions in tough emerging/frontier markets mostly being held by men, we know
we can and must do better to tap valuable skills bysupporting and encouraging women to consider
a broader range of roles within Olam and fulfil
their potential.
We must produce more food using fewer resources
In the past our agricultural systems have coped
With population surges and shifting dietaiy habits.However, given climate change impacts‘ waterconstraints and other Planetary Boundaries, thisbecomes a far more difficult challenge going forward.
The Planetary Boundaries framework as developedby the Stockholm Resilience Centre and a group ofearth system and enVironmentai seientists, sets outprecautionary boundaries for 9 critical processes ofhuman driven environmental change. Together‘ thePlanetaiy Boundaries quantify a safe operating spacewithin which we can live well, thus preyiding US adashboard for global sustainability. Beyond theseboundaries, we could potentially face the pOSSibilityof disruptive, catastrophic or Iai’gevscaie changes inEarth system functioning, leading to Significant risks tosOCieties and economies woridWide.
Of these 9 Planetary Boundaries 4 boundaries(including climate change, loss of biodiversity,overload in the nitrogen and phosphorus biogeocheinicaicycles and land use change) have already beentransgressed. We are seeing the impact of this oncrop production, water availability etc. The FAOexplains: “Until about 2030, global warming isexpected to lead to both gains and losses in theproductivity of crops, livestock, fisheries and forestiy,depending on places and conditions. Beyond 2030,the negative impacts of Climate change on agriculturalyields will become increasingly severe in all regions,FAO cites a report by Rosenzweig et al 2013 whichstates: “The impact on yields by the year 2100 underhigh emission climate scenarios Will range between-20 and -45 percent for maize, between -5 and —50percent for wheat, between -20 and -30 percent forrice, and between 730 and 760 percent for soybean.ResolVihg this would be a critical determinant toachieving the level of crop production required tofeed the world in the future.
Understanding and addressing the other planetaiyboundaries is equally critical. For example. the threatto biodiversity. the loss of which “reduces every formof ecological reSiIience.” Currently we lose over 1,000SpeCleS per million peryear and yet the boundary isjust 10 species per year Some of these species thatcould go extinct may include pollinators which are aVital resource for crossepoliinating ﬂowering plantswith a global aggregate production value in excessof US$300 billion. Olam is already spending over
$8 million a year to ensure that we can secure enoughbees t0 poliinate our almond orchards (read more onpage 35). Species decline is not only a threat to thebiodiverSity of our planet, it is a veh/ real tihanCial i‘lSK.
More and more countries have already implementedan Emissions Trading Scheme (ETS) and/or imposeda Carbon Tax. World Bank's report on ”State andTrends of Carbon PriCihg 2016' indicates that already40 countries at the national level and an additional
24 regions at the subenational level have adopted ETSor Carbon Taxes. While today, mother nature‘s backoffice is not set up to issue us the invoices for
the Sel‘ViCeS that we derive from nature to produce thegoods that we deliver to our customers, it is only to beexpected that governments will increasingly assesswhether natural resources are being used efficientlyand economically, and what price companies arepaying to society for the use of natural capital andeco—system sewices that benefit all of us.

Principle 2: Board composition and guidance
To align With the extensive geographical spread anddepth of the business, the existing Board comprisesDirectors with diverse skills and expertise in finance andaccounting, banking, investment, strategic planning.retail, infrastructure, legal and environment andsustainabiiity issues, The size, composition and blend ofexperience of the Board allows discussions on mattersof policy, strategy and performance to be informed,critical and constructive. The profile and key informationof each Director is provided in the Board of Directorssection of the 2017 Annual Report.
Board size
Our Board currently consists of 11 members, 7 of whomare Independent Non-Executive Directors, 2 of whom
are Non—Independent Non-Executive Directors and theremaining 2 being Executive Directors. More than 50% ofthe Board is comprised of Independent Non-ExecutiveDirectors. The 2 Non-Independent Non—ExecutiveDirectors are appointed by Mitsubishi Corporation. TheGNC examines the size of the Board to ensure that it isappropriate for effective decision-making. The reviewtakes into consideration the variety, magnitude, natureand depth of the Group’s business and operations. Basedon the factors considered and the composition of theexisting Board who collectively possess sufficient depthand breadth to discharge duties and responsibilitieseffectively as weli as to make objective decisions, thecurrent Board size of 11 members is appropriate.
Board diversity
The composition of the Board today is a testimony towhat it believes is important: diversity for an optimal mixof expertise and experience. The importance of diversitystretches across skiils, industry experience, geographicexposure, training and gender. The Board today has 2women Directors with the nationalities 0f the Directorsspanning 4 countries. The Board is weII-appointed forthe foreseeabie future,
Independence

Corporate governance report continued
has no familial or commercial relationship with theGroup or its officers and substantial shareholders ofthe Company that could interfere, or be reasonablyperceived to interfere, with the exercise of his or herindependent business judgement in the best interestsof the Company, is considered to be independent.
The Code further requires the independence of anyDirector who has served on the Board beyond 9 yearsto be rigorously reviewed. The basis of determination bythe GNC takes into account the annual confirmation ofindependence (the ‘Confirmation') completed by eachIndependent Director. He orshe is required to criticallyassess their independence by examining the existenceof any relationships or dealings that may compromisetheir independence.
Having carried out its review for the year under reviewand taking into account the views of the GNC, theBoard has determined that, with the exception of the 2Non—Executive Directors and 2 Executive Directors, theremaining 7 Directors are to be considered as independent.
In its review, the GNC has considered the independenceof Mrs Jean-Paul Pinard who has served on the Board formore than 9 years. Mr. Pinard was appointed to theBoard since 2008 and has since chaired the CRSC.Through his chairmanship and guidance, the Company‘sCR&S function as well as the MATS function continues tomature in strength and expertise, with several key CR&Spolicies and related policies developed and implementedand key stakeholders’ relationships built to further theCompany‘s CR&S commitment and endeavours. His vastexperience with the International Finance Corporationremained relevant forthe nature of the Company‘sbusiness in particularthe area of corporate responsibilityand sustainability. The GNC furtherconsidered Mr.Pinard's independence of mind and opined that he hasconsistently exercised independentjudgement andevidently expressed his views objectively and is able toexercise strong independent business judgement with
a view to acting in the best interests of our Company,thereby demonstrating an independence of mind.Notwithstanding Mr. Pinard having served on the Boardbeyond 9 years, the Board concurred with therecommendation of the GNC that Mr, Pinard is to beconsidered as independent.
Ongoing renewal of the Board
The ongoing renewal of the Board is in line with theBoard‘s policy on tenure ofdirectorships. Since 2013,long-serving independent directors were retiredgradually at each AGM with new independent directorswho possess the required skills and capabilitiesappointed to fill these vacancies. All newly appointedindependent directors will be subject to a term of officecomprising two terms of 3 years each, with an additionalterm of 3 years at the sole discretion of the Board. Alldirectors whether Executive, Non-Executive orIndependent remain subject to an annual evaluation
notwithstanding the term of office. Independent Directorsmay be retired prior to completion of the term of office itso determined by the Board, taking into considerationthe recommendation of the GNC.
Non»Executive Independent Directors
The Non—Executive Independent Directors fulfil a pivotalrole in corporate accountability. Their role is particularlyimportant as they provide unbiased and independentviews. advice and judgement to protect the interestsnot only of the Company but also of shareholders,employees, customers, suppliers and the manycommunities in which the Company conducts business.The Board has since 2013 maintained the number ofExecutive Directors at 2 to have a greater proportion

Remuneration policy fur Executive Directors andother key executives
Executive Directors are not entitled to either base fees orfees for membership on Board Committees. Remunerationfor Executive Directors currently comprises a base salary,a performance bonus tied to the Compaan and the individualsperformance, and participation in the Olam Share Grant Plan.
The Company advocates a performance—basedremuneration system that is flexible and responsive to themarket. The total remuneration comprises 3 components:an annual fixed cash component, an annual performanceincentive and a long-term incentive. The annual fixedcomponent consists of the annual basic salary and otherfixed allowances. The annual performance incentive is tiedto the Company’s and individual executive’s performance,while the long-term incentive is granted based on theindividual’s performance and contribution made.
To remain competitive. it would be our aim to benchmarkour executives’ compensation with that of similarperforming companies and remain in the top 25 percentile.The compensation structure has been designed so that. asone moves up the corporate ladder, the percentage of totalremuneration at risk increases. The Company currently has10 top key executives who are not also Directors.
Information on the compensation paid to Directors andkey executives is summarily provided in the notes to theFinancial Statements of the Financial Report.
In considering the disclosure of remuneration of theExecutive Directors and top 10 key executives, theHRCC considered the industry conditions in which theGroup operates, as well as the confidential nature of theExecutive Directors’ and key executives’ remuneration.
In view of the highly competitive industry conditions theGroup operates within, and as many of our competitorsdo not publish details of the specific remuneration of keyexecutives, the Board is of the view that detailed publicationof the remuneration of the Group’s key executives shouldnot be made. Given the general sensitivity andconfidentiality of remuneration matters, it would bedisadvantageous to the interests of the Group to divulgeremuneration of Executive Directors, the CEO and keyexecutives in such detail as recommended by the Code.

Group CEO review continued
Clear and Differentiated Strategy
In 2017 we completed the second year of our 2016-2018Strategic Plan We have now entered the last year of thisplan (2018). There was no change to our strategy in 2017.Our strategy is centred around a strong core, namelysupply chain management of agricultural raw materialsand food ingredients (origination, logistics, trading andrisk management) and then selectively integrating acrossthe value chain, including upstream (plantations andfarming), midstream (manufacturing and processing)
and downstream (packaged foods distribution). In linewith our strategic plan in 2017, we continued to pursuegrowth in our prioritised platforms, worked to turnaroundunderperforming businesses, and nurtured our gestatingassets to start contributing. As described in the overviewsection of this review and in the following Group COOReview (see pages 37 to 66) these initiatives have yieldedstrong results
In the second half of 2018, we will embark on our next
2 - 3 year strategic plan exercise for the two 3—yearperiods 2019-2021 & 2022-2024‘ This new strategic planwill be communicated in early 2019 once it is approvedby our Board
Our clear and differentiated strategy in terms of wherewe participate and how we win in our industry, hashelped us achieve more consistent, sustainable andprofitable growth over the current plan period. We arefocused on the agri-complex but broadly diversified withinit. We have built market leading positions in our prioritisedplatforms (Edible Nuts, Cocoa, Grains, Coffee and AnimalFeed, Spices and Vegetable Ingredients and Cotton) andstrategic niche positions in a number of other adjacentproducts, markets and value Chain segments (Palm,Rubber, Wood Products, Packaged Foods Business andAg Logistics in Africa, Rice in Asia and Africa, SugarMilling and Refining in Asia, Dairy farming in Russia andUruguay etc.)

OurStrategy: Focused, differentiatedand defensible
. Focused on niche commodities and nichebusinesses with global leadership positions(etgt Edible Nuts. Cocoa, Coffee, Spices &Vegetable Ingredients, Cotton, Rice, PackagedFoods & Rubber)
. Adopt defensible niche strategies inmainstream commodity categories(e‘g. Grains: Africa Milling and asset lightdestination trading; Animal Feeds; Keyemerging markets in Africa and Asia: Sugar:Indonesia Refining, lhdia Milling; Palm:leadership in West Africa)
. Unique African footprint and operatingcapabilities: Direct presence in 25 countriesin Africa
. Out—origin our competition: Buying directlyfrom growers and village level agentsat the tarmgate or the lowest level ofaggregation possible
. Provide value-added solutions and servicesto customers: Traceability guarantees,sustainable and certified raw materials, vendormanaged inventory solutions, risk managementsolutions and proprietan/ market intelligence

Group CEO review continued
Evolution of 0lam's Business Model: 0lam 2.0
In my CEO Review for 2015, I had described in detailOlam‘s business model which we call ‘The Olam Way‘.'The Olam Way‘ forms the basis for the way we lead,organise, compete, grow and succeed in the marketplaceWe compete on the basis of this business model and
like other winning business models, we expect ours toachieve the unexpected, by helping us realise our Visionof ‘beeoming the most differentiated and valuable globalagribusiness by 2040’.
'The Olam Way‘ has 12 elements that together deliver4objectives for us: i) Setting the direction for the company;il) Defining where to play and how to win; iii) Knowingwho we are; and iv) Aligning the organisation to deliverourstrategy.
The current ‘Olam Way’ version Olam 10 has served uswell for the last 28 years. The many changes and actionsinitiated over the course of the last 2 years is likely toresult in Olam becoming by the end of 2018, a verydifferent company from the Olam 0f 3 years ago We nowhave an extensive upstream farming and plantationfootprint; our midstream manufacturing footprint hasgrown 10-fold during this period, we are recognised asbeing leaders in sustainability, and ourfarmer/supplierand customer networks/engagement have given us aglobal edge in many of our products. All these initiativesand changes combined together has resulted in Olam 1.0evolvmg into Olam 2.0. This is an evolutionary rather thana revolutionary change.
We have a broad consensus within the company fortheneed and importance of keeping ‘The Olam Way'dynamic and treating it as an active and living documentto be continually refined and strengthened so that it isalways fit for purpose. As our business changes, ‘TheOlam Way’ will continue to evolve with it. Olam 2.0 is thisfirst major evolution of ‘The Olam Way'.
We have identified 6 key priorities in Olam 2.0 that willhelp us stay ahead and make Olam future ready: i) Focuson drivers of long-term value; ii) Put sustainability at theheart of our business; iii) Build operational excellence asa core competency; iv) Lead industry's digital disruptionand transformation; v) Enhance our culture, values andspirit; and vi) Realign and renew our organisation toexecute our strategy.
0 Focus on drivers of long-term value
Research by Ocean Tomo LLC (one of the world’sleading Intellectual Capital Valuation, Management andAdvisory Services firm) done on the S&P 500 companiesfor the last 45 year period shows that the market value ofthese companies over time is explained less by the valueof their tangible assets and is increasingly determinedmore by the value of their intangible assets. The study
shows that in 1975, 83% of the S&P 500 companiesmarket value was explained by their tangible assets andonly 17% by their intangible assets, whereas in 2015 only16% 0f the S&P 500 market value was determined by itstangible assets and 84% was explained by theirintangible assets,
To create value over the iong-term, it has becomeincreasingly clear that organisations need to activelymanage a broader set ofdrivers beyond Financial andEconomic Capital (equity, debt, tangible assets) thatincludes Manufactured Capital (the stock of thecompany’s factories, farms, equipment, etc.), IntellectualCapital (R&D, patents, copyrights, knowhow,organisational systems and processes, etc.), IntangibleCapital (brand, reputation, know-how etc), HumanCapital (motivation and engagement of its employees,attrition rates, capability development, culture, spirit,capacity to innovate, etc), Social Capital (relationshipoetween the company and all its stakeholders includingcommunities, government relations, customers and othersupply chain partners) and Natural Capital (including thecompany’s carbon, water, waste footprint and the cost ofhese externalities), However, these broader set ofong-term drivers and different forms of Capital that driveong-term value are not universally assessed in currentreporting frameworks, even though they drive a significantaortion of today’s market value.
There is a significant and increasing disconnect betweenoday‘s reporting formats and the drivers of long-termvalue for a few specific reasons: i) accounting profit andshareholder returns are disconnected becauseaccounting profit is quick to recognise the short—termchanges in revenues and costs, but does not accountforhe value likely to be derived from investments made forhe long term. For example, at Olam (as described in theearlier sections of this review) we have investedsigniﬁcantly in sustainability, digitalisation and capabilityauilding initiatives, all of which will decrease ouraccounting profits, however it does not reflect thepotential value that will be created from theseinvestments; ii) we often measure and report what is easyratherthan what is right, for example, inadequatereporting on intangibles; iii) the failure of companies toaddress idiosyncratic Environmental, Social andGovernance (ESG) tail risks, which if materialised,diminishes future cash flows and increases the cost ofcapital; and iv) the timelines mismatch by co-minglingoperating cost with different forms of Iong-term, gestatingcapital investments, which confuses the understanding ofhow well an organisation is investing to maintain orenhance its Iong-term competitive advantage.

This is why we at Olam have now begun to value thesebroad set of drivers and measure the various forms ofcapital that drive long—term value for the company.

of the Group in accordance with the Accounting and Corporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethicsfor Public Accountants and Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to our audit of thefinancial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with these requirements and theACRA Code We believe that the audit evidence we have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion
Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance in our audit of the ﬁnancial statementsof the cunent period. These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial statements as a whole, and in forming ouropinion thereon, and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our auditaddressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditofs responsibilities for the audit of the financial statements section of ourreport, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our audit included the performance of procedures designed to respond toour assessment of the risks of material misstatement 0f the ﬁnancial statements. The results of our audit procedures, including theprocedures performed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanying financial statements.
1 Fairvalue ofretained interest in investment injointly-contrulled entityDuring the current financial year, the Group divested 50% of an existing subsidiary as described in Note 13. As a result of thedivestment, the retained interest of the investment at the Group is required to be remeasured and recorded at its fair value, whichbecomes the cost on initial recognition of the investment in a jointly—controlled entity, The fairvalue of the retained interest wasdetermined using a value—in—use model by discounting the underlying cash flow forecasts. Due to the measurement of fair valuebeing inherentlyjudgemental, we have considered this to be a key audit mattert
Our procedures in relation to assessing the fair value measurement included:- Understanding how the management determines the fairvalue measurement of the retained interest
- Evaluating the reasonableness of management’s conclusions on key assumptions including forecast cash flows focusing onrevenues and earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation (‘EBITDA’), assessing the appropriateness of discountrates with the assistance of our valuation specialist, and growth rates to historical trends and external market data to assess thereliability of management’s forecast
- Testing the mathematical accuracy of the model

Impairment assessment of goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets and fixed assets
The Group makes and has signiﬁcant investments in ﬁxed assets. goodwill and intangible assets as disclosed in Notes 10 and 11respectively that are associated with its operations and business units around the world, Management performs periodic reviews ofgoodwill, intangible assets with indefinite life and ﬁxed assets for indication of impairment. Impairment assessments are performedwhenever there are indicators of impairment based on the periodic reviews, or as part of an annual impairment assessment exerciseas required Realisable values of the ﬁxed assets, goodwill and indeﬁnite life intangible assets are determined based on thebusiness units’ cash ﬂow forecasts and are performed by management with the help of independent professional valuers whereapplicable. Due to the element of judgement exercised in forecasting and discounting future cash flows, we have considered this tobe a key audit mattert
Our procedures included:
- Evaluating the reasonableness of management's conclusions on key assumptions including forecast cash flows focusing onrevenues and earnings before interest, tax depreciation and amortisation ('EBITDA’), assessing the appropriateness of discountrates with the assistance of our valuation specialist where required and growth rates to historical trends to assess the reliability ofmanagement’s forecast and, in addition to comparing forecast assumptions to external market analysis, whilst considering the riskof management bias.
- Where independent professional valuers are involved, assessing the competence, capabilities and objectivity and evaluating theappropriateness of the impairment model prepared by independent professional valuers
- Testing the mathematical accuracy of the models
- Reviewing the Group’s disclosures of the application of judgement in estimating cash—generating units cash flows and thesensitivity of the results of these estimates adequately reflect the risks assomated with goodwill, indefinite life intangible assets andfixed assets impairment
Valuation of biological assets
The Group operates various farms and plantations for which the livestock, agricultural produce (fruits on trees’) and annual cropsare subject to valuation. These significant biological assets across the Edible Nuts, Spices and Vegetable Ingredients and FoodStaples and Packaged Foods segments, are fair valued by management and/or independent professional valuers engaged bythe Group using industry/ market accepted valuation methodology and approaches Due to the measurement of fair value beinginherently judgemental, we have considered this to be a key audit matter.
Our procedures in relation to assessing the fairvalue measurement included:
- Understanding how the management determines the fairvalue measurement of the biological assets, including the involvement ofthe independent professional valuers
- Evaluating the appropriateness of the valuation model prepared by management and/or independent professional valuers indetermining the fairvalue which include forecast cash flows, discount rates and yield rates for the plantations and market pricesof the fruits or nuts/crop and livestock
- Reviewing the sufficiency and appropriateness of the Group’s disclosures 0n the application ofjudgement in estimating cash—generating units cash flows and the sensitivity of the results of those estimates adequately reflect the risks associated withbiological assets valuation
Valuation of Financial instruments
As disclosed in Notes 34 and 35 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group enters into various ﬁnancial instruments whichare required to be carried at fair value. Estimation uncertainty is high for those ﬁnancial instruments where signiﬁcant valuation inputsare unobservable (Le. Level 3 instruments) as it involves exercise of judgement and use of assumptions and estimates. Due to therelated judgement in estimation, this is considered a key audit mattert
Our procedures in relation to assessing the fairvalue measurement included:
- Assessing controls over identiﬁcation, measurement and management of valuation risk, and evaluating the methodologies, inputsand assumptions used. The review also included comparisons of observable inputs against independent sources and externallyavailable market data
- Evaluating the assumptions and models used or re-performing independent valuation assessment to assess the reasonablenessof the computed fair value, with the help of our own valuation specialist where required
- Reviewing the appropriateness and adequacy of disclosures of fair value risks and sensitivities to reﬂect the Group’s exposure tovaluation risk

IndependentAuditnr's ReportcontinuedFor the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2017T0 the Members OFUIam International Limited
Information other than the Financial Statements and Auditor's Report Thereon
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information in the Annual Report 2017 comprises the information includedin (i) Strategy Report, (ii) Governance Report and (iii) Director‘ Statement (within the Financial Report) sections, but does not include thefinancial statements and our auditor’s report thereon Our opinion on the ﬁnancial statements does not cover the other information and wedo not express any form of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the ﬁnancial statements, our responsibility is to read the other information and, in doing so, considerwhether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financial statements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwiseappears to be materially misstated We have nothing to report in this regard
Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the financial statements
Management is responsible for the preparation of ﬁnancial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the provisions ofthe Act and FRSs, and for devising and maintaining a system of internal accounting controls sufﬁcient to provide a reasonable assurancethat assets are safeguarded against loss from unauthorised use or disposition; and transactions are properly authorised and that they arerecorded as necessary to permit the preparation of true and fair financial statements and to maintain accountability of assets.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern,disclosing. as applicable, matters related to going concern and using the going concern basis of accounting unless management eitherintends to liquidate the Group or to cease operations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group's ﬁnancial reporting process,
Auditor's responsibilities for the Audit ofthe Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a whole are free from materialmisstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditofs report that includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is
a high level of assurance, but is not a guarantee that an audit conducted in accordance with SSAs will always detect a materialmisstatement when it exists Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in the aggregate,they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on the basis of these ﬁnancial statements.
As part of an audit in accordance wih SSAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professional scepticism throughoutthe audit We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of ma erial misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error, design and performaudit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtain audit evidence that is sufﬁcient and appropriate to provide a basis for ouropinion. The risk of not detecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error, as fraudmay involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the override of internal control.
- Obtain an understanding of interna control relevant to he audit in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in thecircumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group‘s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates and related disclosuresmade by management.
' Conclude on the appropriateness of management's use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidenceobtained, whether a material uncerainty exists related 0 events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability tocontinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exisB, we are required to draw attention in our auditor‘s reportto the related disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusionsare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the da 6 of our auditor‘s report. However, future events or conditions may cause theGroup to cease to continue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, 3 ructure and conten of the ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the ﬁnancialstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities or business activities within the Groupto express an opinion on the conso idated ﬁnancial sta ements. We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performanceof the group audit, We remain solely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among 0t er matters, the planned scope and timing of the audit and significant auditfindings, including any significant deﬁciencies in internal control that we identify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a s atement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirements regarding independence, andto communicate with them all relationships and other maters that may reasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and whereapplicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of most signiﬁcance in the audit of the ﬁnancialstatements of the current period and are therefore the key audit matters We describe these matters in our auditor‘s report unless law orregulation precludes public disclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter should notbe communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably be expected to outweigh the publicinterest benefits of such communication.

Group CEO review continued
Put sustainability at the heart ofourbusiness
At Olam, we have now firmly put sustainability at the heartof our business with 5 specific objectives in mind: i) it isthe ‘right‘ thing to do; ii) help increase agriculturalproduction within the Planetary Boundaries, iii) to createdifferentiation and build competitive advantage; iv) todrive long-term value creation by reducing the risk tofuture cash flows because of an idiosyncratic ESG tail riskand by reducing the cost of capital because of a higherESG orientation; and v) to inspire our employees byproviding them meaning to their work.
Ensuring Olam grows responsibly has been a core tenetof how we have done business at Olam for several yearsand indeed ‘Growing Responsibly’ has been our CorePurpose since 2012. In 2017, we decided to refresh ourCore Purpose. A good Purpose must answer 2 questions:1) What are we on ﬁre about? Why do we come to workevery day? What is our Cause? What is the big problemthat we are trying to solve?; and 2) How do we conductour business? In order to answer the first set of questionsabove, we need to understand the problem that we are alltrying to solve for in our industry.
As described underthe Social Capital and NaturalCapital impacts sections, on pages 72 to 82, agriculturefaces the immense challenge of producing enough foodand fibre for 9.5 billion people by 2050, while alleviatingpoverty, providing employment and decent livelihoodopportunities in rural areas, while at the same timeconserving natural habitats and biodiversity.Unsustainable conversion or over exploitation of forestsand other natural habitats for food, feed, ﬁbre and fuel,and other related purposes, threaten our natural lifesupport systems including, soil, air, water, all living thingsand the global climate with serious implication for futuregenerations. A response based mainly on doing lessharm orfocusing efforts to eliminate unacceptablepractices such as deforestation at the scale of individualfarms, or on incremental improvements by companiesrepresenting a small fraction of the supply chain, will notbe enough to meet these challenges. instead, we need to‘Re-imagine Global Agriculture’, shifting away fromdestructive resource extraction and towards achievinga net positive impact at scale based on the creationand restoration of natural and social capital withinliving landscapes. That is why we have embraced‘Re-imagining Global Agriculture: Growing Responsibly’as our new purpose in 2017.
Re-imagining global agriculture : Growing Responsibly
How do we conductour business?
Re-imagining Global Agriculture Growing Responsibly
What are we on ﬁre about?
What do we want to achieve?
Prosperous farms Thrivingand farming systems communities
Re—generationof the living world
Our refreshed Corporate Responsibility ?\Sustainability[CRaS] Framework
To this end, we refreshed our global CR&S framework in2017 to integrate our new purpose with our 10 newMaterial Areas, and the UN SDGs that these key materialareas will impact. We have also now mapped and alignedour Material Areas (our focus areas) to the 9 PlanetaryBoundaries. In this exercise we added certain MaterialAreas that were missing from the Planetary Boundariesframework and removed certain other overlapping areas.Most importantly, we have now fully aligned our Purpose,the Material Areas, Planetary Boundaries and the UNSDGs in a coherent manner in our new CR&S Frameworkdescribed on page 15.
Achieving our new purpose is important for ourshareholders. customers, farmers, Board, managementand our 72,000 employees across the world.
“We g0 beyond cans/dering E85factors... We actively seek Out0pp0rtun/t/es that pro videsustainab/e sa/ut/Ons f0r agrowing global populat/‘On. ”
li‘ll‘élfii‘KHitltl itls[Him sStiatatit, Partner 31f. hgn'slwehhltle’‘33 8% stake m Ulilll‘]
In this context, we ramped up external stakeholderengagement in 2017, notably related to our palm andrubber operations, on definitions of deforestation andhow the ‘trade off’ between alleviating abject poverty inagriculturally deficient areas while protecting vital naturalcapital can be managed.
As a key part of our outreach, the Gabon team welcomedmore than 50 NGOs and governmental, finance andmulti-Iateral agency stakeholders to our operations aspart of The Forests Dialogue to discuss the challengesfacing this highly forested nation. In parallel, we areworking extensively to halt smallholder encroachmentinto forests. We have created large set asides (around50% 0f the total concession area) of High ConservationValue areas in our palm and rubber plantations, and areprotecting these areas at our cost and responsibility.Olam Cocoa was also a founding member of the Cocoa &Forests Initiative launched by The Prince of Wales’International Sustainability Unit, working in partnershipwith the World Cocoa Foundation and IDH theSustainable Trade Initiative.

statements in the period of initial application: The nature of the impending changes in accounting policy on adoption ofFRS 115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers, Amendments to FRS 115 and FRS 116 Leases is described below.
FRS115 Revenue from Contracts with Customers and Amendments to FRS115
In accordance with FRS 115, which is effective from 1 January 2018 onwards. excluding interest and dividend income and othersuch income from financial instruments recognised in accordance with FRS 109. revenues are recognised upon transfer ofpromised goods or services to customers in amounts that reﬂect the consideration to which Group expect to be entitled inexchange for those goods or services based on the five step approach as prescribed in the standard.
The Group has performed an impact assessment and does not expect a change in revenue recognition for sales of goods orservices upon adoption 0n 1 January 2018.
FRS11B Leases
FRS 116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on balance sheets to reflect the rights to use (‘ROU’) the leased assets andthe associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciation charges. Thestandard includes two recognition exemptions for lessees — leases of ‘Iow value’ assets and short—term leases. The new leasesstandard is effective for annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2019:
The Group has performed a preliminary high-level impact assessment of the adoption of FRS 116 on its existing operating leasearrangements as lessee. Based on its preliminary assessment, the Group expects these operating leases to be recognised asROU assets and corresponding lease liabilities which will result in increase in total assets and 10ml liabilities, EBITDA andgearing ratio. The Group plans to adopt the standard when it becomes effective in 2019,

24 Functional and Foreign currencyThe Group’s consolidated financial statements are presented in Singapore Dollars‘ Each entity in the Group determines its ownfunctional currency and items included in the financial statements of each entity are measured using that functional currency
The Company’s functional currency is the United States Dollar (‘USD’), which reflects the economic substance of the underlyingevents and circumstances of the Company. Although the Company is domiciled in Singapore, most of the Company’stransactions are denominated in USD and the selling prices for the Company's products are sensitive to movements in theforeign exchange rate with the USD.
[a]
[b]
[c]
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and its subsidiariesand are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximating those ruling at thetransaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchangeruling at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency aretranslated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. Non-monetary items measured at fair value ina foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the date when the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising 0n the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the balance sheetdate are recognised in proﬁt or loss except for exchange differences arismg on monetary items that form part of the Group’snet investment in foreign operations, which are recognised initially in other comprehensive income and accumulated underforeign currency translation reserve in equity. The foreign currency translation reserve is reclassiﬁed from equity to profit orloss of the Group on disposal of the foreign operation
Consolidated financial statements
For consolidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into USD at the rate of exchangeruling at the balance sheet date and their proﬁt or loss are translated at the weighted average exchange rates for the year.The exchange differences arising 0n the translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. On disposal of aforeign operation, the component of other comprehensive income reiating to that particular foreign operation is recognisedin profit or loss,
In the case of a partial disposal without loss of control of a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionateshare of the cumulative amount of the exchange differences are re—attributed to non-controlling interest and are notrecognised in profit or loss. For partial disposals of associates or jointly controlled entities that are foreign operations,the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassiﬁed to profit or loss.
Translation to the presentation currency
The ﬁnancial statements are presented in Singapore Dollar (‘SGD‘) as the Company‘s principal place of business isin Singapore.
The ﬁnancial statements are translated from USD to SGD as follows:-
- Assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are translated at the closing rate ruling at that balance sheet date;- Income and expenses for each proﬁt and loss account are translated at average exchange rates for the year,which approximates the exchange rates at the dates of the transactions; and
All exchange differences arising on the translation are included in the foreign currency translation reserves.

2.5 Subsidiary companies, basis of consolidation and business combinations
24
[a]
[b]
[C]
Subsidiary companies
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlled by the Group. The Group controls an investee when it is exposed, or has rights,to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power overthe investee.
In the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost lesslmpairment losses.
A list of the Group’s signiﬁcant subsidiary companies is shown in Note 13‘
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the ﬁnancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries as at the endof the reporting period. The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiaries used in the preparation of the consolidated financialstatements are prepared forthe same reporting date as the Company Consistent accounting policies are applied to liketransactions and events in similar circumstances.
All intra-group balances, income and expenses and unrealised gains and losses resulting from intra—group transactionsand dividends are eliminated in full.
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of acquisition. being the date on which the Group obtains control. and continueto be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Losses within a subsidiary are attributed to the non-controlling interest even if that results in a deﬁcit balance.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, is accounted for as an equity transaction. If theGroup loses control over a subsidiary, it:
' Derecognises the assets (including goodwill) and liabilities of the subsidiary at their carrying amounts at the date whencontrol is lost;
- Dereoognises the carrying amount of any noncontrolling interest;
- Derecognises the cumulative translation differences recorded in equity;
' Recognises the fair value of the consideration received:
- Recognises the fair value of any investment retained;
- Recognises any surplus or deficit in profit or loss;
' Reclassifies the Group’s share of components previously recognised in other comprehensive income to profit or loss orretained earnings, as appropriate.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition method, Identifiable assets acquired and liabilitiesassumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. Acquisition—relatedcosts are recognised as expenses in the periods in which the costs are incurred and the services are received.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised at fair value at the acquisition date.Subsequent changes to the fairvalue of the contingent consideration which is deemed to be an asset or liability, will berecognised in profit or loss.
In business combinations achieved in stages, previously held equity interests in the acquiree are remeasured t0 fairvalueat the acquisition date and any corresponding gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss
The Group elects for each individual business combination, whether non—controlling interest in the acquiree (if any), thatare present ownership interests and entitle their holders to a proportionate share of net assets in the event of liquidation,ls recognised 0n the acquisition date at fair value, or at the non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’sidentiﬁable net assets. Other components of non—controlling interests are measured at their acquisition date fair value,unless another measurement basis is required by another FRS‘
Any excess of the sum of the fair value of the consideration transferred in the business combination, the amount of non-controlling interest in the acquiree (if any) and the fair value of the Group’s prevlously held equity interest in the acquiree(if any) over the net fair value of the acquiree's identiﬁable assets and liabilities is recorded as goodwill. In instanceswhere the latter amount exceeds the former, the excess is recognised as gain on bargain purchase in proﬁt or loss onthe acquisition date. The accounting policy for goodwill is set out in Note 2.10(a).

'ransactions with non—controlling interests
Non—controlling interest represents the equity in subsidiaries not attributable, directly or indirectly, to owners of the Company,and are presented separately in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income and within equity in the consolidatedbaiance sheet, separately from equity attributable to owners of the Company.
Changes in the Company’s interest in a subsidiary that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions.n such circumstances, the carrying amounts of the controlling and non—Controliing interests are adjusted to reﬂect the changesin their relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjustedand the fair value of the consideration paid or received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to owners of the Company
ointly controlled entities
‘ he Group has interests in joint ventures that are jointly controlled entities A Joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby0 or more parties undertake an economic activity that is subject to joint control, and a jointly controlled entity is a joint venturehat involves the establishment of a separate entity in which each venturer has an interest
' he consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the totai recognised gains and losses of its jointly controlledentities on an equity accounted basis from the date thatjoint control commences until the date that joint control ceases. Whenhe Group‘s share of losses exceeds the carrying amount of the investment, the investment is reported as nil and recognition ofosses is discontinued except to the extent of the Group’s commitment.
n the Company’s separate financial statements, investments in jointly controiled entities are stated at cost less impairment loss.' he carrying amounts of the jointly controlled entities are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is anyndication of impairment. If such indication exists, the recoverable amount is estimated and any impairment loss is recognisedwhenever the carrying amount exceeds the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is charged to profit or loss.
Jpon loss of joint control, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fair value. Any difference betweenhe carrying amount of the formerjoint venture entity upon loss of joint venture control and the aggregate of the fair value of theretained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

AssociatesAn associate is an entity over which the Group has the power to participate in the ﬁnancial and operating policy decisions ofhe investee but does not have control or joint control of those policies.
' he Group's investments in associates are accounted for using the equity methodi Under the equity method, the investment inwe associate is measured in the balance sheet at cost plus post-acquisition Changes in the Group‘s share of net assets of theassociate. Goodwill relating to an associate is included in the carrying amount of the investment and is neither amortised norested individually for impairment. Any excess of the Group’s share of the net fair value of the associates identifiable assets,iabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of the investment is included as income in the determination of the Group'sshare of results of the associate in the period in which the investment is acquired
' he proﬁt or loss reflects the share of the results of operations of the associates. Where there has been a change recognisedn other comprehensive income by the associates, the Group recognises its share of such changes in other comprehensiveincomes Unrealised gains and losses resulting from transactions between the Group and the associate are eliminated to theextent of the interest in the associates.



' he Group’s share of the profit or loss of its associates is shown on the face of proﬁt or loss after tax and non—controllinginterests in the subsidiaries of associates.
When the Group's share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognisefurther losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf of the associates
After application of the equity method, the Group determines whether it is necessary to recognise an additional impairment losson the Group’s investment in its associates. The Group determines at each balance sheet date whetherthere is any objectiveevidence that the investment in the associate is impaired If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment asthe difference between the recoverable amount of the associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount in the profitor loss.
The financial statements of the associates are prepared as of the same reporting date as the Company. Where necessary,adjustments are made to bring the accounting policies in line with those of the Group
Upon loss of signiﬁcant influence over the associate, the Group measures and recognises any retained investment at its fairvalue. Any difference between the carrying amount of the associate upon loss of significant influence and the fair value of theaggregate of the retained investment and proceeds from disposal is recognised in profit or loss.

2.9 Property,plantand equipment
All items of property, plant and equipment are initially recorded at cost. Such cost includes the cost of replacing part of theproperty, plant and equipment and borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or productionof a qualifying property, plant and equipment The accounting policy for bonowing costs is set out in Note 217. The cost ofan item of property, plant and equipment is recognised as an asset if, and only if, it is probable that future economic beneﬁtsassociated with the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be measured reliably.
Subsequent to recognition, all items of property. plant and equipment (except for freehold land) are stated at cost lessaccumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Freehold land has an unlimited useful life and therefore isnot depreciated. Leasehold land and buildings are depreciable over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset orthe lease period,
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for use and is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated usefullife except for ginning assets of Queensland Cotton Holdings, which are depreciated using the units of use method. Theestimated useful life of the assets is as follows:-
Bearer plants - 15 to 30 years
Leasehold land and buildings - 5 to 50 years
Plant and machinery - 3 to 25 years; 30 years for ginning assetsMotor vehicles - 3 t0 5 years
Furniture and ﬁttings - 5 years
Office equipment - 5 years
Computers - Syears
Other assets in Note 10 comprise motor vehicles, furniture and fittings, office equipment and computers.
Bearer plants - Immature plantations are stated at acquisition cost which includes costs incurred for field preparation, planting,farming inputs and maintenance, capitalisation of borrowing costs incurred on loans used to finance the development ofimmature plantations and an allocation of other indirect costs based on planted hectarage.
Capital work-in-progress is not depreciated as these assets are not yet available for use.
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstancesindicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
An item of property, plant and equipment is derecognised upon disposal or when no future economic benefits are expectedfrom its use or disposal. Any gain or loss on derecognition of the asset is included in the proﬁt and loss account in the year theasset is derecognised.
2.10 intangible assets
[a] GoodwillGoodwill is initially measured at cost. Following initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulatedimpairment losses.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a business combination is, from the acquisition date, allocatedto each of the Group's cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination,irrespective of whether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
The cash-generating unit to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually and whenever there
is an indication that the cash-generating unit may be impaired. Impairment is determined for goodwill by assessing therecoverable amount of each cash-generating unit (or group of cash—generating units) to which the goodwill relates. Wherethe recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount, an impairment loss is recognised inthe profit and loss account. Impairment losses recognised for goodwill are not reversed in subsequent periods.
Where goodwill forms part of a cashgenerating unit and part of the operation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwillassociated with the operation disposed of is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining the gain orloss of disposal of the operation. Goodwill disposed of in this circumstance is measured based on the relative fairvalues ofthe operations disposed of and the portion of the cash-generating unit retained.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign operations on or after 1 January 2005 are treatedas assets and liabilities of the foreign operations and are recorded in the functional currency of the foreign operations andtranslated in accordance with the accounting policy set out in Note 24‘

210 Intangible assets continued
[b] UtherintangibleassetsIntangible assets acquired separately are measured initially at cost The cost of intangib e assets acquired in a businesscombination is their fair value as at the date of acquisition Following initial acquisition, in angible assets are measured atcost less any accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses
The useful lives of intangible assets are assessed as either ﬁnite or indefinite.
Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortised on a straight-line basis overthe es imated useful lives and assessedfor impairment whenever there is an indication that the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period and theamortisation method are reviewed at least at each ﬁnancial year-end. Changes in the expected useful life or the expectedpattern of consumption of future economic benefits embodied in the asset is accounted or by changing the amortisationperiod or method, as appropriate, and are treated as changes in accounting estimates ' he amortisation expense onintangible assets with ﬁnite lives is recognised in the proﬁt or loss in the expense category consistent with the function
of the intangible asset.
Intangible assets with indeﬁnite useful lives or that are not yet available for use are not su aject to amortisation and they aretested for impairment annually or more frequently if the events and circumstances indica e that the carrying value may beimpaired either individually or at the cash-generating unit levelt Such intangible assets are not amortisedt The useful lifeof an intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually to determine whether the useful life assessmentcontinues to be supportable. If not, the change in useful life from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.
Gains or losses arising from derecognition of an intangible asset are measured as the di erence between the net disposalproceeds and the carrying amount of the asset and are recognised in the profit or loss when the asset is derecognised.

2.11 Biological assets
[a] Agricultural produce [‘Fruits on trees'] and annual cropsThe agricultural produce (‘fruits on trees') are valued in accordance with FRS 41 Agriculture. The fair value amount is anaggregate of the fair valuation of the current financial year and the reversal of the prior year’s fair valuation. The fair valuationtakes into account current selling prices and related costs. The calculated value is then discounted by a suitable factor totake into account the agricultural risk until maturity.
The annual crops have been valued using adjusted cost, which is the estimate of the yield and cost of the crop at harvestdiscounted for the remaining time to harvest, which approximate fairvalue.
[b] LivestockLivestock are stated at fair value less estimated point—ofsale costs, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in theprofit or loss. Point-of-sale costs include all costs that would be necessary to sell the assets, The fairvalue of livestock isdetermined based on valuations by an independent professional valuer using the market prices of livestock of similar age,breed and generic merit.
2.12 Impairment of non-financial assetsThe Group performs periodic reviews of non—ﬁnancial assets for indication of impairment. Impairment assessment are donewheneverthere are indicators of impairment, or as part of an annual impairment assessment exercise as required. The Groupmakes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount with the help of independent professional valuers where applicable.
An asset‘s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset‘s or cash-generating unit's fair value less costs of disposal and itsvalue in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inﬂows that are largelyindependent of those from other assets or group of assets Where the carrying amount of an asset or cashgenerating unitexceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverable amount. In assessingvalue in use, the estimated future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset are discounted to their present valueusing a pre—tax discount rate that reﬂects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁc to theasset. In determining fairvalue less costs of disposal, recent market transactions are taken into account, if available. If no suchtransactions can be identiﬁed, an appropriate valuation model is used. Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds itsrecoverable amount, the asset is written down to its recoverable amounts
Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in profit or loss in those expense categories consistent with thefunction of the impaired asset, except for assets that have been previously revalued and where the revaluation was taken toother comprehensive income. In this case the impairment is also recognised in other comprehensive income up to the amountof any previous revaluation.

2.12 Impairment of non—Financial assets continuedFor assets excluding goodwill, an assessment is made at each reporting date as to whether there is any indication thatpreviously recognised impairment losses may no longer exist or may have decreased If such indication exists, the Groupestimates the assets or cashgenerating unit’s recoverable amount. A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed onlyif there has been a change in the estimates used to determine the assets recoverable amount since the last impairment losswas recognised If that is the case, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to its recoverable amount. That increasedamount cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation, had no impairment lossbeen recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in the profit or loss unless the asset is measured at revalued amount,in which case the reversal is treated as a revaluation increase.
2.13 Financial instruments
[at] Financial assets
Initial recognition and measurementFinancial assets are recognised when, and only when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of theinstruments The Group determines the classification of its ﬁnancial assets at initial recognition.
When financial assets are recognised initially, they are measured at fair value, plus, in the case of ﬁnancial assets notat fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs,
Subsequent measurement
Deht llTSEl’tlmEl'ltS
Subsequent measurement of debt instruments depends on the Group’s business model for managing the asset andthe contractual cash ﬂow characteristics of the asset. The three measurement categories for classiﬁcation of debtinstruments are:-
[i] Amortised costFinancial assets that are held for the collection of contractual cash flows where those cash ﬂows represent solelypayments of principal and interest are measured at amortised cost. Financial assets are measured at amortisedcost using the effective interest method, less impairment. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss whenthe assets are derecognised or impaired, and through amortisation process
[in] Fairvaltiethrough othercumprehenswcincome[‘F\/UCl‘]Financial assets that are held for collection of contractual of cash ﬂows and for selling the ﬁnancial assets, wherethe assets’ cash flows represent solely payments of principal and interest, are measured at FVOCI. Financial assetsmeasured at WOCI are subsequently measured at fair value. Any gains or losses from changes in fair value of theﬁnancial assets are recognised in other comprehensive income, except for impairment losses, foreign exchange gainsand losses and interest calculated using the effective interest method are recognised in profit or loss. The cumulativegain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income is reclassiﬁed from equity to proﬁt or loss as areclassification adjustment when the financial asset is de~recognised
[iii] Fairvaluethmtigh ptoﬂtorlossAssets that do not meet the criteria for amortised cost or FVOCI are measured at fair value through profit or loss.A gain or loss on a debt instruments that is subsequently measured at fair value through proﬁt or loss and is not partof a hedging relationship is recognised in profit or loss statement in the period in which it arises. Interest income fromthese ﬁnancial assets is included in the finance income
Equity Instruments
The Group subsequently measures all equity instruments at fair value. On initial recognition of an equity instruments thatis not held for trading, the Group may irrevocably elect to present subsequent changes in fair value in 001. Dividendsfrom such investments are to be recognised in profit or loss when the Group’s right to receive payments is established.
Changes in fair value of financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss.Changes in fair value of financial assets at FVOCI are recognised in OCIt
Denvatives
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a den‘vative contract is entered into and are subsequentlyremeasured to theirfair value at the end of each reporting period. Changes in fairvalue of derivatives are recognised inprofit or loss,

Impairment
The Group assesses on a forward looking basis the expected credit losses (‘ECL’) associated with its debt instrumentassets carried at amortised cost and FVOCI. For trade receivables only, the Group measures the loss allowance at anamount equal to the lifetime expected credit losses.
Derecngnition
A ﬁnancial asset is derecognised when the contractual right to receive cash ﬂows from the asset has expired.
On derecognition of a financial asset in its entirety, the difference between the carrying amount and the sum of theconsideration received and any cumulative gain or loss that had been recognised in other comprehensive incomeis recognised in profit or loss.
Financial liabilities
Initial recognition and measurementFinancial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of thefinancial instrument The Group determines the classification of its ﬁnancial liabilities at initial recognition
All ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus, in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value throughprofit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interestmethod‘ Gains and losses are recognised in proﬁt or loss when the liabilities are derecognised, and through theamortisation process.
Derecognition
A ﬁnancial liability is derecognised when the obligation under the liability is discharged or cancelled or expires. When anexisting financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of anexisting liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modiﬁcation is treated as a derecognition of the originalliability and the recognition of a new liability and the difference in the respective carrying amounts are recognised in profitor loss.
Uffsetting of financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are offset and the net amount is presented in the balance sheets, when and onlywhen, there is a currently enforceable legal right to set off the recognised amounts and there is an intention to settle on anet basis, or to realise the assets and settle the liabilities simultaneously.
2.14 Cash and cash equivalentsCash and cash equivalents comprise cash and bank balances and short—term ﬁxed bank deposits that are subject to aninsigniﬁcant risk of changes in value. These also include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group’scash management.
Cash and cash equivalents carried in the balance sheets are classified and accounted as measured at amortised cost underFRS 109‘ The accounting policy for this category of financial assets is stated in Note 213.

2.18 Provisions
2.15 Impairment offinancial assets
Trade receivablesThe Group measures the loss allowance for its trade receivables at an amount equal to lifetime expected credit losses, whichare the present value of the cash shortfalls over the expected life of the financial assets.
Other financial assets
Accordingly, other ﬁnancial assets are classified as measured at amortised cost less expected impairment losses. The Group'sotherﬁnancial assets have contractual cash ﬂows that are solely principal, and interest and the business model's objective is tohold these assets to collect contractual cash ﬂows. Impairment allowances for otherfinancial assets are determined based onthe 12-month expected credit loss model.
2.16 inventories
Inventories principally comprise commodities held for trading and inventories that form part of the Group‘s expected purchase,sale or usage requirements.
Inventories for commodity trading businesses are measured at fair value less costs to sell, with changes in fair value less coststo sell recognised in the profit or loss in the period of the change.
Inventories that form part of the Group’s expectec purchase, sale or usage requirements are stated at the lower of cost andnet realisable value and are valued on a first—in—tirst—out basis or weighted average cost method, depending on the underlyingbusiness activity. Net realisable value represents he estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less anticipatedcost of disposal and after making allowance for damages and slow-moving items,
For fruits on trees that are harvested, are stated a fair value less estimated pointof-sale costs at the time of harvest (the ‘initialcost‘). Thereafter these inventories are carried at he lower of initial cost and net realisable value.
Where necessary. allowance is provided for damaged, obsolete and slow—rnoving items to adjust the carrying value ofinventories to the lower of cost and net realisable value.
Borrowing costs are capitalised as part of the cos of a qualifying asset if they are directly attributable to the acquisition,construction or production of that asset. Capitalisation of borrowing costs commences when the activities to prepare the
asset for its intended use or sale are in progress and the expenditures and borrowing costs are incurred. Borrowing costs arecapitalised until the assets are substantially comp eted for their intended use or sale, All other borrowing costs are expensed inthe period they occur. Borrowing costs consist of interest and other costs that an entity incurs in connection with the borrowingof funds.

Provisions are recognised when the Group has a aresent obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it isprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amountof the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted to reflect the current best estimates. If it is no longer probablethat an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. If the effect of the timevalue of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre—tax rate that reflects, where appropriate, the risksspecific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as afinance cost.

The Group participates in the national pension schemes as defined by the iaws of countries in which it has operations. Inparticular, the Singapore companies in the Group make contributions to the Central Provident Fund scheme in Singapore,3 deﬁned contribution pension scheme. Contributions to deﬁned contribution pension schemes are recognised as anexpense in the period in which the related service is performed
Employee leave entitlementEmployee entitlements to annual leave are recognised as a liability when they accrue to employees. A provision is madefor the estimated liability for leave as a result of services rendered by employees up to the balance sheet date.
Employee share options scheme/share grant planEmployees (including senior executives) of the Group receive remuneration in the form of share—based payment forservices rendered (‘equity-settled transactions').
The cost of these equity-settled sharebased payment transactions with employees is measured with reference to the fairvalue at the date on which the share subscriptions/options are granted which takes into account market conditions andnon-vesting conditions
This cost is recognised in the proﬁt or loss. with a corresponding increase in the share—based compensation reserve,overthe vesting period. The cumulative expense recognised at each reporting date until the vesting date reflects theextent to which the vesting period has expired and the Group’s best estimate of the number of options that will ultimatelyvest. The charge or credit to the profit or loss for a period represents the movement in cumulative expense recognised asat the beginning and end of that period and is recognised in employee benefits expense.
No expense is recognised for options that do not ultimately vest, except for options where vesting is conditional upon amarket condition or non-vesting condition, which are treated as vested irrespective of whether or not the market conditionor non-vesting condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance and/or service conditions are satisfied. In the casewhere the option does not vest as the result of a failure to meet a non-vesting condition that is within the control of the Groupor the employee, it is accounted for as a cancellation. In such case, the amount of the compensation cost that otherwisewould be recognised over the remainder of the vesting period is recognised immediately in profit or loss upon cancellation.
In situations where equity instruments are issued and some or all of the goods or services received by the entity asconsideration cannot be speciﬁcally identiﬁed, the unidentified goods or services received (or to be received) aremeasured as the difference between the fair value of the sharebased payment and the fair value of any identifiablegoods or services received at the grant date. This is then capitalised or expensed as appropriate.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modiﬁed.In addition, an expense is recognised for a modiﬁcation, which increases the total fair value of the share-based paymentarrangement, or is otherwise beneﬁcial to the employee as measured at the date of modiﬁcation.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it has vested on the date of cancellation, and any expensenot yet recognised forthe award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted forthe cancelledaward, and designated as a replacement award on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treatedas if they were a modification of the original award, as described in the previous paragraph.

2.20 Leases
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains a lease is based on the substance of the arrangement at theinception date: whether fulfilment of the arrangement is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets or the arrangementconveys a right to use the asset, even if that right is not explicitly speciﬁed in an arrangement
[3] Operating leaseOperating lease payments are recognised as an expense in profit or loss on a straight—Iine basis over the lease term.
The aggregate benefit of incentives provided by the lessor is recognised as a reduction of rental expense over the leaseterm on a straight—line basis.
[b] Finance leaseFinance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and rewards incidental to ownership of the leaseditem, are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value ofthe minimum lease payments. Any initial direct costs are also added to the amount capitalised. Lease payments areapportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve a constant rate of intereston the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged to profit or loss
Capitalised leased assets are depreciated over the shorter 0f the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.if there is no reasonable certainty that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term.
2.21 Revenue recognition
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the economic benefits will ﬂow to the Group and the revenue
can be reliably measured, regardless of when the payment is made Revenue is measured at the fair value of considerationreceived or receivable, excluding discounts, rebates and sales taxes or duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangementsto determine if it is acting as principal or agent. The Group has concluded that it is acting as a principal in all of its revenuearrangements. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before revenue is recognised:
[a] Sale of goodsRevenue from the sale of goods is recognised upon passage of title to the customer, which generally coincides with theirdelivery and acceptance. Revenue is not recognised to the extent where there are significant uncertainties regardingrecovery of the consideration due, associated costs or the possible return of goods,
[b] Sale of servicesRevenue from services rendered is recognised upon services performed
[0] interest incomeInterest income is recognised using the effective interest method.
2.22 Government grants, export incentives and subsidies
Government grants, export incentives and subsidies are recognised at their fairvalues when there is reasonable assurancethat the grant will be received and all conditions attached will be complied with, When the grant relates to an expense item,
it is recognised in the proﬁt or loss over the period necessary to match it on a systematic basis to the costs that it is intendedto compensate. When the grant relates to an asset, the fair value is recognised as deferred capital grant on the balance sheetand is amortised t0 the proﬁt or loss over the expected useful life of the relevant asset by equal annual instalments.
2.23 Taxes
[8] Current income taxCurrent income tax assets and liabilities for the current and prior periods are measured at the amount expected to berecovered from or paid to the taxation authorities. The tax rates and tax laws used to compute the amount are those thatare enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period, in the countries where the Group operates andgenerates taxable income.
Current income taxes are recognised in proﬁt or loss except to the extent that the tax relates to items recognised outsideprofit or loss, either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. Management periodically evaluates positions takenin the tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishesprovisions where appropriate.

223 Taxes continued[b] Deferred tax
[c]
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method on temporary differences at the balance sheet date between the taxbases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts for financial reporting purposes.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all temporary differences, except:
- where the deferred tax liability arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction thatis not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither the accounting profit nortaxable proﬁtor loss; and
- in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests in jointventures, where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that thetemporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised for all deductible temporary differences. carryforward of unused tax credits and unusedtax losses, to the extent that it is probable that taxable profit will be available against which the deductible temporarydifferences, and the carryforward of unused tax credits and unused tax losses can be utilised except:
- where the deferred tax asset relating to the deductible temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of an assetor liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects neither theaccounting profit nor taxable proﬁt or loss; and
- in respect of deductible temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and interests injoint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that the temporary differenceswill reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profitwill be available against which the temporary differences canbe utilised.
The carrying amount of deferred tax asset is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is
no longer probable that sufficient taxable proﬁt will be available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised.Unrecognised deferred tax assets are reassessed at each balance sheet date and are recognised to the extent that it hassecome probable that future taxable profit will allow the deferred tax asset to be utilised.
Deferred ax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the year when the asset isrealised or the liability is settled, based on tax rates and tax laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at theaalance sheet date.
Deferred ax relating to items recognised outside profit or loss is recognised outside profit or loss. Deferred tax itemsare recognised in correlation to the underlying transaction either in other comprehensive income or directly in equity anddeferred tax arising from a business combination is adjusted against goodwill on acquisition.
Deferred ax assets and deferred tax liabilities are offset if a legally enforceable right exists to set off current income taxassets against current income tax liabilities and the deferred taxes relate to the same taxable entity and the sameaxation authority.
Tax beneits acquired as part of a business combination, but not satisfying the criteria for separate recognition at that date,would be recognised subsequently if new information about facts and circumstances changed. The adjustment would bereated ei her as a reduction to goodwill (as long as it does not exceed goodwill) if incurred during the measurement periodor in profi or loss.
Sales taxRevenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of sales tax except:
- where he sales mix incurred on a purchase of assets or services is not recoverable from the taxation authority, inwhich case the sales tax is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of the assets or as part of the expense itemas app icable; and
- where receivables and payables are stated with the amount of sales tax included.


The net amount of sales tax recoverable from or payable to the taxation authority is included as part of receivables orpayables in the balance sheet.

2.24 Segment reportingFor management purposes, the Group is organised into operating segments based on their products and services, which areindependently managed by the respective segment managers responsible for the performance of the respective segmentsunder their charge.
The segment managers report directly to the management of the Company which regularly reviews the segment results inorder to allocate resources to the segments and to assess the segment performance Additional disclosures on each of thesesegments are shown in Note 38, including the factors used to identify the reportable segments and the measurement basis ofsegment information.
2.25 Share capital and share issue expensesProceeds from issuance of ordinary shares net of directly attributable expenses are recognised as share capital in equity.
2.26 Treasury sharesThe Group‘s own equity instruments, which are reacquired (treasury shares) are recognised at cost (including directlyattributable expenses) and deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss on the purchase, sale, issueor cancellation of the Group’s own equity instruments. Any difference between the carrying amount of treasury shares and theconsideration received, if reissued, is recognised directly in equity. Voting rights related to treasury shares are nullified for theGroup and no dividends are allocated to them respectively.
2.27 Perpetual capital securitiesThe perpetual capital securities do not have a maturity date and the Company is able to elect to defer making a distributionsubject to the term and conditions of the securities issue. The Company is considered to have no contractual obligation to makeprincipal repayments or distributions in respect of its perpetual capital securities issue. Accordingly, the perpetual capitalsecurities do not meet the deﬁnition for classification as financial liability and are presented within equity. Distributions aretreated as dividends which will be directly debited from equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of theperpetual capital securities are deducted against the proceeds from the issue.
2.28 ContingenciesA contingent liability is:-(a) a possible obligation that arises from past events and whose existence will be conﬁrmed only by the occurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group; or
(b) a present obligation that arises from past events but is not recognised because:(i) It is not probable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation; or(ii) The amount of the obligation cannot be measured with sufﬁcient reliability.
A contingent asset is a possible asset that arises from past events and whose existence will be confirmed only by theoccurrence or non-occurrence of one or more uncertain future events not wholly within the control of the Group.
Contingent liabilities and assets are not recognised on the balance sheet of the Group, except for contingent liabilitiesassumed in a business combination that are present obligations and for which the fair values can be reliably determined.
2.29 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activitiesDerivative ﬁnancial instruments include fon/vard currency contracts, commodity futures, options, over—the—counter (‘OTC')structured products, commodity physical fonNards, foreign currency swap and interest rate swap contracts. These are usedto manage the Group‘s exposure to risks associated with foreign currency, commodity price and interest rate fluctuations.Certain derivatives are also used for trading purposes. Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fairvalue on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivativefinancial instrumenm are carried as assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.
The fair value of forward currency contracts and interest rate derivatives are calculated by reference to current forwardexchange rates and interest rates respectively for contracts with similar maturity proﬁles. The fair values of commodity futures,options, OTC structured products and physical fon/vards are determined by reference to available market information andmarket valuation methodology. Where the quoted market prices are not available, fair values are based on management’sbest estimates, which are arrived at by reference to market prices.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies continued2.29 Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued
Hedge accountingThe Group applies hedge accounting for certain hedging relationships which qualify for hedge accounting.
For the purpose of hedge accounting. hedges are classiﬁed as:-
' fairvalue hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability or anunrecognised firm commitment; or- cash ﬂow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated
with a recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction or the foreign currency risk in an unrecognisedﬁrm commitment.
[a] Fair value hedges
Zair value hedge accounting is applied to hedge the Group’s exposure to changes in the fairvalue portion of such an assetor liability or an identiﬁed portion of such an asset or liability that is attributable to a particular risk — commodity price risk thatcould affect the profit and loss account. For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item (inventories) isadjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being hedged, the derivative (hedging instrument) is remeasured at
air value, gains and losses from both are taken to the profit and loss account
When inventories are designated as a hedged item, the subsequent cumulative change in the fair value of these inventoriesattributable to the hedged commodity price risk is recognised as part of inventories with a corresponding gain or loss in
he proﬁt and loss account. The hedging instrument is recorded at fair value as an asset or liability and the changes in theair value of the hedging instrument are also recognised in the proﬁt and loss account
'he application of hedge accounting is discontinued in cases where the Group revokes the hedging relationship. Effectiverom FRS 109, hedging relationships may not be voluntarily revoked unless there is a change in risk management objective.Accordingly, in cases where a hedging relationship ceases to meet the hedge effectiveness requirement relating to thewedge ratio but the risk management objective remains unchanged, the Group adjusts the hedging ratio to reestablish
he effectiveness of the hedging relationship. Furthermore, the Group discontinues the application of hedge accounting incases where there is a change in the risk management objective for the hedging relationship. The fairvalue adjustment
0 the carrying amount of the hedged item arising from the hedged risk is expensed to proﬁt and loss account from thedate on which the Company discontinues hedge accounting.
[b] Cash flow hedges
=or each cash flow hedge relationship, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument isrecognised directly in other comprehensive income. Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred0 proﬁt or loss when the hedged transaction affects profit or loss. The ineffective part of any gain or loss is recognisedimmediately in the profit and loss account at the time hedge effectiveness is tested‘
When a cash ﬂow hedge is discontinued, any cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensiveincome will remain in the cash ﬂow hedge reserve until the future cash flows occur‘ If the hedged future cash ﬂows noonger expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss is immediately reclassified to profit and loss account.
2.30 Convertible bonds
When convertible bonds are issued, the towl proceeds net of transaction costs are allocated to the debt component, thefair value of derivative ﬁnancial instruments component and the equity component, which are separately presented on thebalance sheet.
The debt component is recognised initially at its fair value, determined using a market interest rate for equivalent non-convertiblebonds. It is subsequently carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method until the debt is extinguished onconversion or redemption of the bonds.
The derivative ﬁnancial instruments component is determined by the fair value of the embedded derivatives on the date ofissue. The fair value is reassessed at every balance sheet date and the difference is recognised in the profit and loss account.
The balance after reducing the debt component and the fair value of the embedded derivatives component from the netproceeds is presented as capital reserve under equity The carrying amount of the equity component is not adjusted insubsequent periods. When the conversion option is exercised, the carrying amount of the equity component will be transferredto the share capital account. When the conversion option lapses, its carrying amount will be transferred to retained earnings.

(vii) A person identiﬁed in (a) (i) has signiﬁcant influence over the entity or is a member of the key management personnelof the entity (or of a parent of the entity).
Significant accounting judgements and estimates
The preparation of the Group‘s financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptionsthat affect the reported amounts of revenues, expenses, assets and liabilities, and the disclosure of contingent liabilities at thereporting date. However, uncertainty about these assumptions and estimates could result in outcomes that could require amaterial adjustment to the carrying amount of the asset or liability affected in future periods.
Key sources ofestimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimating uncertainty as at the balance sheet date, that havea signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year, arediscussed below. The Group based its assumptions and estimates on parameters available when the ﬁnancial statements wereprepared. Existing circumstances and assumptions about future developments, however, may change due to market changes orcircumstances arising beyond the control of the Group. Such changes are reflected in the assumptions when they occur.
[a] Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lifeManagement performs periodic reviews of goodwill, intangible assets with indefinite life for indication of impairment. The Groupestimates the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill and intangible asset with indefinite useful life isallocated‘ Estimating the value in use requires the Group, with the help of independent professional valuers where applicable,to make an estimate of the expected future cash ﬂows from the cash-generating units and also to choose a suitable discountrate in orderto calculate the present value of those cash ﬂows.
The impairment tests are sensitive to growth rates and discount rates. Changes in these assumptions may result in changes inrecoverable values. The carrying amount of the Group's goodwill and indefinite life intangible assets at the balance sheet date isdisclosed in Note 11 to the financial statements.

[d]
An impairment exists when the carrying value of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, which is the higher of its fairvalueless costs to sell and its value in use The fair value less costs to sell calculation is based on available data from binding salestransactions in an arm's length transaction of similar assets or observable market prices less incremental costs for disposing theasset. The value in use calculation is based on a discounted cash flow model and requires the Group, with the help ofindependent professional valuers where applicable. to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash—generating units and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash ﬂows. The
carrying amount of the Group’s property, plant and equipment at the balance sheet date is disclosed in Note 10 to the financialstatements,
Biological assets
The fair value of biological assets (other than annual crops and livestock) is estimated using the discounted cash ﬂow model,which requires the Group to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the biological assets and also to choose asuitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows, which is referenced to professional valuationsor fair valued by independent professional valuers where signiﬁcant The valuation of these biological assets is particularlysensitive to discount rates and they are disclosed in Note 12.
Fair value of Financial instruments
Where the fair values of ﬁnancial instruments recorded on the balance sheet cannot be derived from active markets, they aredetermined using valuation techniques including the discounted cash flow modelt The inputs to these models are derived fromobservable market data where possible, but where this is not feasible, a degree ofjudgement is required in establishing fairvalues, The judgements include considerations of model inputs regarding forward prices, credit risk, volatility and counterpartyrisk that are not supported by observable market data Changes in assumptions about these factors could affect the reportedfair value of ﬁnancial instruments. The valuation of financial instruments is described in more detail in Note 35.

Fruits on trees and annual crops
During the financial year, the Group harvested approximately 43,429 metric tonnes (31 December 2016: 44,071 metric tonnes)of almonds, which had a fair value less estimated point»of—sale costs of approximately $262,904,000 (31 December 2016:$463,805,000). The fair value of almonds was determined with reference to the market prices at the date of harvest.
Annual crops consist of various commodities such as cotton, onions, tomatoes and other vegetables, rice and grains. For cotton,onions, tomatoes and other vegetables, the Group provides seeds to farmers to sow and grow while for rice and grains, the Groupmanages its own farms. For annual crops where seeds are provided, the farmers take all the harvest risks and bear all the farmingcosts, However, the Group has the ﬁrst ﬁght to buy the produce from these farmers, when these annual crops are harvested.
At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the Group’s total planted area of annual crops is approximately 99,310 (31 December 2016:111,712) hectares, excluding for those commodities where farms are not managed by the Group.
Fairvalue determinationThe fair value of fruits on trees is estimated with reference to an independent professional valuation using the present value ofexpected net cash flows from the biological assets.
The following table shows the key inputs used:-
Key Inputs Inler—relationsmp between key inputs and fairvaiue measurement

Discount rates of 14.6% (31 December 2016: 15.0%) per annum The estimated fair value increases as the estimated discountrate per annum decreases, and vice versa.
Market prices approximating $9,993 (31 December 2016: $9,500) The estimated fair value increases as the respective inputsper metric tonne increase, and vice versa.
The annual crops have been valued using adjusted cost, based on the estimate of the yield and cost of the crop at harvestdiscounted for the remaining time to harvest, which approximates fairvalue.
Livestock
Livestock relates mainly to dairy cattle in Uruguay and Russia, At the end of the ﬁnancial year, the Group held 42,297 (31 December2016: 32,290) cows, which are able to produce milk (mature assets) and 38,321 (31 December 2016: 39,579) heifers and calves,being raised to produce milk in the future (immature assets). The cows produced 245 million litres (31 December 2016: 166 millionlitres) of milk with a fair value less estimated point—of—sale costs of $146,978,000 (31 December 2016: $94,051,000) during thefinancial year.
Fairvalue determinationThe fair value of livestock is determined based on valuations by an independent professional valuer using market prices rangingfrom $69 to $5,132 (31 December 2016: $69 to $3,796) of livestock of similar age, breed and generic merit.
Financial risk management strategies related to agricultural activities
The Group is exposed to ﬁnancial risk in respect of agricultural activity, The agricultural activity of the Group consists of themanagement of biological assets to produce marketable output. The primary ﬁnancial risk associated with this activity occursdue to the length of time between expending cash on the purchase or planting and maintenance of biological assets and onharvesting and ultimately receiving cash from the sale of the marketable output, The Group plans for cash ﬂow requirements forsuch activities and manages its debt and equity portfolio actively.

As outlined in my CEO Review for 2016, we embarked onthe digital transformation of our business in 2016 and
developed and tested a number of solutions for differentparts of our business across 3 buckets in 2017: i) OlamDirect; ii) Olam Inside; and iii) Olam Forward. Ourgoal isto digitise our highest value supply chains end-tO—end,both to drive cost efficiencies and capture additionalvalue across the supply chain.
In 2017, we rolled out 10 digital initiatives including OlamDirect. Customer Service Portal, a Small and MediumBusiness e-Commerce Portal, Drone Image Analytics,Walk the Field mobile app, Digital Warehouse, Transactand Trace, Digital Procurement. Paperless Trade, ElectricMotors Condition Monitoring, and Dryer Optimisation.
We have seen promising results in many ofthese pilotsthat we rolled out in 2017 as shown below:

In addition, we are also pursuing the creation of anindustry leading platform or marketplace that helpsconnect millions of farmers directly with Olam with fairand transparent price discovery while at the same timesource their farm inputs and secure microfinance,insurance, etc. from different vendors and serviceproviders. We are envisaging this to comprise a simpleand usable mobile app for farmers to sell their produceon this platform, and for all of the other service providersto participate in this marketplace.
o Enhance our Culture, Values and Spirit
Over the years, our 6 values and the everyday behavioursthat institutionalise these values in the company havehelped us build a distinctive culture, shaping how wework and setting the standards for what it means to bepart of Claims We have always competed on the basis ofthe organisational advantage that this unique culture hasprovided us. We are currently in the process of reviewingour existing values to see how they should be refreshedto remain relevant in Claim 20 and our evolving priorities

ey questions that we are asking in an extensive bottomup survey relate to which parts of our current cultureshould be preserved and which should we drop.
To reinforce our culture, we have updated our HR vision0 “Building a high-performing and inspired workforce.

[a] Employee share option scheme
The Olam Employee Share Option Scheme (the ‘ESOS’) was approved by shareholders at an Extraordinary General Meetingheld on 4 January 2005. The ESOS rules were amended on 29 October 2008 at the Extraordinary General Meeting of theCompany. Under the amended rules, the directors (including Non-Executive Directors and Independent Directors) andemployees of the Group are eligible to participate in the E808 and all subsequent options issued to the Group‘s employees andExecuttve Directors shall have a life 0f 10 years, instead of 5 years. For Options granted to the Company’s Non-ExecutiveDirectors and Independent Directors, the Option Period shall be no longer than 5 years,
The shares issued upon the options being exercised carry full dividend and voting rights.Controlling Shareholders and associates of Controlling Shareholders are not eligible to participate in the E808.All these options have a contractual life of 10 years with no cash settlement alternatives.
The fair value of share options as at the date of grant, is estimated by the Company using the Black Scholes Model, taking intoaccount the terms and conditions upon which the options are granted. The expected life of the option is based on theassumption that the options would be exercised within six months of the vesting date. The expected volatility reﬂects theassumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may not necessarily be the actual outcome.
Pursuant to the voluntary conditional cash offer by Breedens International Pte Ltd approval was sought and granted on 8 April2014 such that all outstanding options which have not been exercised at the expiry of the accelerated exercise period shall notautomatically lapse and become null and void but will expire in accordance with their original terms.
The ESOS has expired on 3 January 2015. The terms of the E808 continue to apply to outstanding options granted under
the E808. The ESOS rules amended on 29 October 2008 may be read in the Appendix 1 0f the Company’s circular dated13 October 2008.

34. Financial risk management policies and objectives
70
The Group and the Company are exposed to ﬁnancial risks from its operations and the use of financial instruments. The board ofdirectors and board risk committee reviews and agrees on policies and procedures for the management of these risks, which areexecuted by the Chief Financial Officer and Head of Risk. The Audit Committee provides independent oversight to the effectivenessof the risk management process.
The Group’s principal ﬁnancial instruments, other than derivative financial instruments and investment in security, comprise bankloans, medium-term notes, term loans from banks, bonds, cash and bank balances, fixed deposits and bank overdraﬂs. The mainpurpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to ﬁnance the Group’s operations. The Group has various other ﬁnancial assets andliabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from its operations,
The Group also enters into derivative transactions, including interest rate swaps. commodity options. swaps and futures contractsand foreign currency forward contracts. The purpose is to manage the commodity price risk, foreign currency risk and interest raterisk arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of ﬁnancing.
There has been no change to the Group’s exposure to these financial risks or the manner in which it manages and measuresthe risks.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are commodity price risk, credit risk, foreign currency risk, liquidityrisk and interest rate risk. The Board of Directors reviews and agrees on the policies for managing each of these risks and they aresummarised below:-
[a] Commodity price riskCommodities traded by the Group are subject to fluctuations due to a number of factors that result in price risk. The Grouppurchases and sells various derivative products, primarily exchange traded futures and options with the purpose of managingmarket exposure to adverse price movements in these commodities. The Group has established policies and exposure limitsthat restrict the amount of unhedged fixed price physical positions in each commodity.
The Group also enters into commodity derivatives for trading purposes. The Group‘s trading market risk appetite is determinedby the Board of Directors, with detailed exposure limits recommended by the Executive Risk Committee and approved by theBoard Risk Committee.
At balance sheet date, if the commodities price index moved by 1.0% with all other variables held constant, the Group‘s proﬁtnet of tax would have changed by $30,287,000 (31 December 2016: $22,991,000) arising as a result of fair value on Group'scommodity futures, options contracts, physical sales and purchases commitments as well as the inventory held at balancesheet date,

[h] Credit riskCredit risk is limited to the risk arising from the inability of a customer to make payment when due. It is the Group’s policy toprovide credit terms only to creditworthy customers These debts are continually monitored and therefore, the Group does notexpect to incur material credit losses.
For computation of impairment losses on financial assets, the Group uses a provision matrix as presented below:-
Balance Sheet Expected credit loss

Trade receivables (Note 17)Loans to jointIy-controlled entities and associates (Note 14)Other current assets — Sundry receivables. export incentives and subsidies A percentage of the financial asset calculated
receivable, deposits, staff advances, insurance receivables, amount due by taking the default sovereign risk rating of thefrom jointIy—controlled entity, associates and a shareholder related company counterparties based on external benchmarks(Note 21)
Amount due from subsidiary companies (Note 16)

The carrying amounts of trade receivables. other non-current and curTent assets, margin accounts with brokers, cash andshort—term deposits payments, including derivatives with positive fair value represent the Group’s maximum exposure tocredit risk. No other ﬁnancial assets carry a signiﬁcant exposure to credit risk. Deposits and cash balances are placed withreputable bankst

[0] Foreign currency risk
The Group trades its products globally and, as a result, is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates. Theprimary purpose of the Group’s foreign currency hedging activities is to protect against the volatility associated with foreigncurrency purchases and sales of raw materials and other assets and liabilities created in the normal course of business TheGroup primarily utilises foreign currency forward exchange contracts to hedge ﬁrm commitments The Group does not useforeign currency forward exchange contracts for trading purposes.
The Group has transactional currency exposures arising from sales or purchases that are denominated in a currency otherthan the respective functional currencies of Group entities. The foreign currencies in which these transactions are denominatedare mainly United States Dollar (USD), Great Britain Pounds (GBP), Euro (EUR), Australian Dollar(AUD) and Singapore
Dollar (SGD).
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity of the Group's proﬁt net of tax and equity to a reasonably possible change inthe USD, GBP, EUR, AUD and SGD exchange rates. with all other variables held constant

(d) Liquidity riskLiquidity risk is the risk that the Group or the Company will encounter difficulty in meeting financial obligations associated with itsfinancial liabilities or due to shortage of funds.
To ensure continuity of funding, the Group primarily uses short—term bank facilities that are transaction-Iinkecl and self—quuidatingin nature, The Group also has a multicurrency medium-term notes programme, as well as term loans from banks, to fund itsongoing working capital requirement and growth needs.

[e] interest rate riskThe Company’s and the Group's exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relate primarily to its ﬂoating rate loansand borrowings. Interest rate risk is managed on an ongoing basis such as hedging the risk through interest rate derivativeswith the primary objective of limiting the extent to which net interest exposure could be affected by adverse movements ininterest rates. The details of the interest rates relating to the interest-earning ﬁnancial assets and interest-bearing ﬁnancialliabilities are disclosed in various notes to the financial statements.
At the balance sheet date, if interest rates had moved by 25 basis points with all othervariables held constant, the Group‘sprofit net of tax would have changed inversely by $27,607,000 (31 December 2016: $25,393,000).

Fairvalue hedge
The Group is exposed to price risk on the purchase side due to increase in commodity prices, on the sales sides and inventoryheld to decrease in commodity prices. Therefore, the Group applies fair value hedge accounting to hedge its commodity pricesembedded in its inventories, sales and purchase contracts and uses commodity derivatives to manage its exposure. The Groupdetermines its hedge effectiveness based on the volume of both hedged item and hedging instruments.
For all the commodity derivatives used for hedging purposes, the forecasted transactions are expected to occur within 3 to
24 months. The commodity derivatives held for hedging are used to hedge the commodity price risk related to inventories, salesand purchases contracts. The accumulated amount of fair value hedge adjustments included in the carrying amount of theinventories for the current ﬁnancial year amounts to $178,271,000 (31 December 2016: $276,553,000).
Cash flow hedge
For all the foreign exchange and commodity derivatives used for hedging purposes, the forecasted transactions are expectedto occur within 24 months (31 December 2016: 24 months). For all cases where the Group applies hedge accounting, the fairvalue of the derivative recorded in the tairvalue adjustment reserves will be recycled through the proﬁt and loss account uponoccurrence of the forecasted transactions and this amounts to $68,037,000 for the current financial year. The net hedging lossrecognised in the ‘Other Comprehensive Income' in relation to such transactions amounts to $11,619,000 in the currentfinancial year.
Cash ﬂow hedges of expected transactions that were assessed to be highly effective have resulted in a net fair value gain of$146,841,000 for both the Group and Company for the financial year ended 31 December 2017 (31 December2016: gain of$22,544,000) There was no hedge ineffectiveness recorded in Profit and Loss during the current financial year.
35.Fair values of assets and liabilities
[a] Fairvalue hierarchyThe Group classifies fair value measurements using a fair value hierarchy that is dependent on the valuation inputs usedas follows:
- Level 1 — Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active market for identical assets or liabilities that the Group can access at themeasurement date,
- Level 2 — Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly orindirectly, and- Level 3 — Unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.

Determination of fair valueLong-term investment relates to one investment in the current financial year, of which is based on quoted closing prices at thebalance sheet date
Foreign exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are valued using a valuation technique with market observable inputs.The most frequently applied valuation techniques include forward pricing and swap models, using present value calculations.The models incorporate van'ous inputs including the credit quality of counterparties, foreign exchange spot and forward rates,interest rate curves and forward rate curvest
Commodity contracts, inventories and power purchase agreement are valued based on the following:-
- Level 1 7 Based on quoted closing prices at the balance sheet date;
- Level 2 — Valued using valuation techniques with market observable inputs. The models incorporate various inputsincluding the broker quotes for similar transactions, credit quality of counter—parties, foreign exchange spot and forwardrates, interest rate curves and forward rate curves of the underlying commodities; and
- Level 3 — Valued using inputs that are not based on observable inputs such as historical transacted pn'ces and estimates.
Certain commodity contracts which were valued based on Level 3 in the previous financial year, are valued based on Level 2 inthe current ﬁnancial year as there were available broker quotes unlike in the previous ﬁnancial yeart
The fairvalue of biological assets (fruits on trees, annual crops and livestock) has been determined through various methodsand assumptions. Please refer to Note 12 for more details.

In order to determine the effect of the above reasonably possible alternative assumptions, the Group adjusted the following
key unobservable inputs used in the tairvalue measurement:
- For certain commodity contracts and inventories, the Group adjusted the market prices of the valuation model by 1%.- For Iong-term investment (unquoted), the Group adjusted the assumptions to the model inputs of the valuation model
by 0.5%.
- For biological assets, the Group adjusted the estimated discount rate applied to discounted cash flow model by 0.5%.

(i)
(ii)
Cash and short—term deposits, trade receivables. other current assets, margin accounts with brokers, amounts due fromsubsidiary companies, trade payables and accruals, other current liabilities and bank overdrafts.
The fair values of these financial instruments approximate their carrying amounts at the balance sheet date because of theirshort—term maturity.
Bank loans, term loans from banks and obligations from finance leases
The carrying amount of the bank loans, term loans from banks and obligations from finance leases are an approximation offair values as they are subjected to frequent repricing (ﬂoating rates) and/ or because of their short—term maturity.
[e] Fairvalue offinancial instruments by classes that are not carried at fairvalue and whose carrying amounts are notreasonable approximation of fairvalue
(i)
(ii)
Loans to subsidiary companies, loans to jointly controlled entities and loans to associates
Loans to subsidiary companies, loans to jointly controlled entities and loans to associates have no ﬁxed terms of repaymentand are repayable only when the cash flow of the entities permits. Accordingly, the fair value of these amounts is notdeterminable as the timing of the future cash flow arising from these balances cannot be estimated reliably.
Other non-current assets — investment in dairy co—operative
The Group’s investment in a dairy co—operative has been carried at cost because fairvalue cannot be measured reliably asthe dairy co—operative is not listed and does not have any comparable industry peerthat is listed. in addition, the variabilityin the range of reasonable fair value estimates derived from valuation techniques is signiﬁcant. The Group does not intendto dispose of this investment in the foreseeable future.

36.Capital management
80
The Group manages the capital structure by a balanced mix of debt and equity. Necessary adjustments are made in the capitalstructure considering the factors vis—a—vis the changes in the general economic conditions, available options of financing and theimpact of the same on the liquidity position. Higher leverage is used for funding more liquid working capital needs and conservativeleverage is used for Iong—term capital investments. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during thefinancial years ended 31 December 2016 and 31 December2017.
The Group calculates the level of debt capital required to finance the working capital requirements using traditional and modiﬁedfinancial metrics including leverage/gearing ratio and asset turnover ratio.
As at baiance sheet date, leverage ratios are as follows:-


Group31 December 31 December2017 2016Gross debt to equity:- Before fair value adjustment reserve 1.76 times 2.36 timesNet debt to equity:- Before fair value adjustment reserve 1.46 times 1.99 times
The Group assesses the level of debt capital used to finance capital investment in respect of the projected risk and returns of theseinvestments using a number of traditional and modiﬁed investment and analytical models including discounted cash ﬂows. It alsoassesses the use of debt capital to fund such investments relative to the impact on the Group’s overall debt capital position andcapital structure
in order to manage its capital structure, the Group may issue debt of either a ﬁxed or ﬂoating nature, arrange credit facilities, issuemedium—term notes, issue new shares or convertible bonds and adjust dividend payments

38.3egmental information
82
The Group’s businesses are organised and managed as ﬁve broad segments grouped in relation to different types and nature ofproducts tradedt The Group’s supply chain activities of sourcing, processing and merchandising span across a broad range ofagricultural products
The segmentation of products has been done in the following manner:-
- Edibte Nuts, Spices and Vegetable Ingredients 7 Edible Nuts (cashew, peanuts, almonds, hazelnuts, pistachios, walnuts,sesame and beans including pulses, lentils and peas), spices and vegetable tngredients (including pepper, onion, garlic,capsicums and tomato)
- Confectionery and Beverage Ingredients 7 cocoa and coffee.
- Industrial Raw Materials, Ag Logistics and Infrastructure 7 cotton, wood products, rubber, fertiliser and Gabon Special EconomicZone (GSEZ including ports and infrastructure).
- Food Staples and Packaged Foods — n‘ce, sugar and sweeteners, grains and animal feed, edible oils, dairy and packaged foods.
. Commodity Financial Services — risk management solutions, market—making, volatitity and asset management, and trade andstructured ﬁnance.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a
reasonable basis, Unallocated items mainly comprise corporate cash, fixed deposits, other receivables and corporate liabilities
such as taxation and borrowings Assets which are unallocated are common and shared by segments and thus it is not practical to
allocate them,
Management monitors the operating results of its business units separately for the purpose of making decisions about resource
allocation and performance assessment. The measure used by management to evatuate segment performance is different from
the operating profit or loss in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. as explained in the table in Note 38(a).
Group ﬁnancing (including finance cost), which is managed on group basis, and income tax which is evaluated on group basis
are not allocated to operating segments.
The turnover by geographical segments is based on the location of customers regardtess of where the goods are produced.
The assets and capital expenditure are attributed to the location of those assets.

Kurniadi, is a 38-year old farmer:
“ In early 2000, Ibegan to cultivate cocoa on my form. However, during the past fewyears I realised thatmy cocoa farm was not productive because of pests and disease.
“ While thinking about changing from cocoa to another crop, Iheard from a friend who said there is acompany that wanted to buy cocoa beans directly from farmers. And if the news was true indeed thatfarmers can get a betterpriee, then this sounded too good to be true
” Iattended one of the socialisation events. 0Iam Indonesia was announcing direct purchasing from thefarmers under a programme called 0Iam Direct. From the saeialisatioh I started to learn about cocoabean quality. The 0Iam Direct programme not only enables the purchase of beans manually but alsothrough an onlihe bean-seI/Ing android application. 000/! Unfortunately, [still had my old phone, but asIhad registered with the 0Iam Direct programme, Igot information about the cocoa bean price everyday by SMS,
” I was very satisﬁed with the price Igot for my beans in the ﬁrst transaction. Recently] purchased anew phone, and I was embarrassed because I could not operate a smartphone. However, after trainingfrom the 0Iam Direct field staff, I conducted my first successful online transaction.
“ With 0Iam Direct, I am excited to take more care of my cocoa trees, and / will think a thousand timesbefore I decide to shift to a different crop. “

Our Purpose in action: Prosperous farmers and farming systems
INNOVATING SUPPLYCHAINS TO BENEFITFARMERS AND OLAM
One of the many challenges for crops like coffee and cocoa is the sheernumber ofsmall-scale farmers living in very remote regions with
limited infrastructure.
Collecting directly from each farmer, and proper handlingof the crop, are labour and time intensive. This is whyintermediaries have established themselves, buying fromfarmers in a certain area and then selling to the nextintermediary so the crop gradually moves from farm toport. Reducing the number of transactions can providebetter value to the farmer, as well as increasing theefficiency of the supply chain. It also means that Olam ispaying a higher price‘
Designed by the Digital Olam team, Olam Direct is anindustry~|eading tech platform that will help connectmillions of farmers directly with Olam to ensure a fair andtransparent sourcing process and improve traceabilitytThe app was launched to 00003 farmers in August inWiyono village, Lampung Province, Indonesia, where theylearned how to check the cocoa price online, indicateintent and transact with Olam. Tips on Good Agricultural
Practices are also issued. Farmers can now make moreinformed decisions for the harvesting and sale of theircocoa, thereby improving their livelihoods. A field forceand toll-free helpline help farmers feel at easedownloading and transacting on the app‘
Olam is also building partnerships with telecom serviceproviders to improve digital penetration in upcountry areasand with banks to open accounts for the farmers, bringingfinancial inclusion, as well as reducing the cost and risksfor high-volume transactions. Furthermore, the appimmediately connects the Olam Cocoa logistics teamswho can co-ordinate collection and warehousing moreefficiently. We now intend to take our innovations andapply them to other farmers both in Indonesia andelsewhere; continuing to increase the value of farming,improving livelihoods and further re-imagination of thesupply chain,

HELPING COMMUNITIESTHRIVE BY REVIVINGCOTTON GROWING IN
cﬁTE D'IVOIRE
Ulam subsidiary SECO1 acquired its first ginnery in 2008, when the countrywas recovering from civil war lasting from 2002 to 2007. Before the unrest,Cﬁte d'Ivoire was among West Africa's main cotton producers but during thecrisis production slumped dramatically.
Against this backdrop, SECO’s ginning model and supportof partners Compaci and GIZ, gatvanised cotton farmersand addressed agricultural, finanCial and social issues torevive cotton production, secure smallholders’ livelihoods,and increase food security.
From first engaging 3,000 farmers in 2008, SECO is todayworking with 16,600 farmers to plant 64,500 ha of cotton.Yields have increased from 625kg to over 1,000kg/ha.
As a result, SECO has commissioned a new gin in Ferke.Socially, the programme has improved literacy andnumeracy, provided dedicated training for women,supporting them to achieve financiai access and improve
awareness of food crop production and nutrition. Anotherprogramme focuses on business skills, especially foryoung people. By taking a Iong-term approach thataddresses commercial, social and environmental
needs, SECO has helped impoverished communities
to re-imagine an agricultural future for themselves.
Learnings contributed to the Olam Livelihood Charter,and, in January 2017, SECO was featured in a film fromthe Business Sustainable Development Commissionand Economist Films. Previously it had featured in abook by Conor Woodman2 as a positive exampte ofinclusive business.

CREATING HEDGEROWSFOR BEES IN CALIFORNIA
Olam is the second largest grower of almonds globally and the onlysupplier with orchards in both hemispheres [Australia and California],meaning we can provide a year-round fresh supply to customers.
In California, the team works with various experts, in areasspanning water management, soil health and biodiversity.Bees are critical, and in January they are transported toCalifornia to pollinate the almond orchards of more than6,800 farmers.
In 2017, we required around 680 million bees for ourextensive orchards, costing US$15 million, so it’s importantthat we provide the best incentive for the bees to stay,rather than fly elsewhere! It’s also important that they
are productive, which means they need to be healthy.
In 2014, with General Mills and Xerces Society forInvertebrate Conservation, the almonds team createdalmost 10 kilometres of flowering hedgerows so that beesand other pollinators can get the varied diet they need,as well as attracting bees naturally,
In an interview in 2017, Jessa Kay Cruz, senior pollinatorconservation specialist for the Xeroes Society said of theOlam orchard: ”This farm really serves as a great modelfor what can be done. Olam has been able to adopt all ofthese great practices that really improve the biodiversity ofthe farm and make it better for pollinators.
Larry Hanson, Olam Director of Agricultural Research &Development, has also been working with Project Apis mwhich provides mustard seed mixes for ﬂoral diversity Theseare sown on Olam’s land on the research farm outsideHanford to promote healthy bee colonies. Just likehumans, bees are better able to deal with stressors ifproperly nourished, better able to fend off pests andparasites and cope with pesticides and transportation stress.Healthier bees mean stronger hives and better pollination.
Other measures to protect bees and other pollinators includeavoiding the use of any insecticides during the pollinationperiod and applying tree fungicide only at night when bees arenot activet More widely, Olam promotes Integrated PestManagement (IPM) techniques 7 these include 'threshold'spraying, which adapts pesticide use according to bug levelsin individual ﬁelds, and using natural methods to deter pests,such as planting maize as a border cropt
Better management practices, smarter use of technology,and restoring natural capital in and around our orchards,plantations and farms, can help protect biodiversity
and enable the natural process to supply ecosystemservices This is at the heart of our vision to re-imagineglobal agriculture.

We posted a 65.3% increase inPATMI to 8355807 million (2016:S$351.3 million). This was driven byexceptional gains from divestments,an improved operating performanceand lower taxes after adjusting forhigher depreciation and amortisation.and net finance charges.
We booked a net exceptional gain ofS$1492 million for 2017 and thiscame mainly from the 8351212 milliongain from the partial divestment of50.0% interest in Far East Agri Pte.Ltd. (FEA), the sugar refinerybusiness in Indonesia, as well as88534.2 million gain from the sale offarmland assets in the USA, whichwas partially offset by the 85196.2miliion cost provision made for thewage settlement agreement in theUSA for the Spices and VegetableIngredients platform. The prioryear2016 had a net exceptional loss of855125 million, which was due to thebuyback of high coupon bonds.

AgLogistics and Infrastructure reported a 45.9% increase inEBITDA from $551352 million to 8351973 million whileFood Staples and Packaged Foods was up 8.9% from85193302 million to S$359.7 million. CFS turned in apositive EBITDA of $354.8 million against a loss of S$1.6million in the previous year. The improvement in EBITDAhelped offset lower contribution from the Confectioneryand Beverage Ingredients segment which was down19.5% from S$407.2 million to S$327.7 million.(Segmental performance will be discussed in greaterdetail on pages 46 to 66.)
More importantly. the growth in EBITDA was achieved ona reduced invested capital base compared to 2016 andtherefore we were able to lift the EBITDA on averageinvested capital return from 7.8%10 8.2% in 2017.Invested capital came down by 4.9% from 88516.6 billionin 2016 to S$15.8 billion in 2017 and this was mainly aresult of a 13.0% reduction in working capital deployed.despite our highervolume (56.3%) and revenue growth(27.6%). While most of the reduction in working capitalwas aided by lower commodity prices, a significant
part of the reduction was on account of various
working capital optimisation initiatives undertakenacross businesses.
We continued our targeted fixed capital investments
in prioritised platforms to complete our committedinvestments and extract full value from our upstreamand midstream assets. Net capital expenditures (Capex)outflow was lower on account of the capital release
from divestments.

Strategic Plan Progress
We made very good progress in the execution of our2016-2018 Strategic Plan. In fact, Olam met most of itskey priorities set for 2017, as set out in the Plan. Wedelivered improved Operational PATMI and EBITDA/ICfor 2017, as well as positive Free Cash Flow to Firm(FCFF) of S$1 ,484.4 million and Free Cash Flow to Equity(FCFE) of 8851 ,020.4 million by end-2017 — which is arecord achievement by our Group. We executed on thefollowing initiatives to release cash and improve cashflow generation:
- Associated company GSEZ sold 25.0% stake in itssubsidiary company GSEZ Mineral Port to Meridiam inSeptember2017 and also sold concession rights tooperate the new Owendo International Port in Gabon toBolloré Group in October 2017. Post these transactions,GSEZ repaid its shareholder loan of€66.0 million(approximately 8891040 million) to Olam in the secondhalf of 2017.
- We sold 5,100 acres (approximately 2.100 hectares) ofedible nuts farmland assets in California, USA, toFarmland Partners Inc. for a cash consideration ofUS$110.0 million in December 2017. In addition to thecash release, a net gain of US$250 million (S$34.2million) was booked as exceptional income in 2017.
» We divested 50.0% stake in FEA, which owns sugarrefining company PT Dharmapala Usaha Sukses. t0Mitr Phol for US$100.0 million as part of our strategicpartnership agreement with the company to enter intosugar milling in Indonesia. The transaction resulted in aone—time gain of US$885 million (8351212 million)based on the written down carrying value of the assetsfor 2017,
- We also set up 2 task forces to improve cost andcapital efficiency: While we have focused on makinginvestments in prioritised platforms, we have beenlooking at working capital optimisation initiatives toextract more cost and capital efficiencies across allour operations.
We also made significant progress in turning aroundunderperforming businesses and ensuring gestatihgbusinesses reach full potential:
. Dairy farming in Uruguay continued to report improvedﬁnancial and operating results year—on-year;
- The rice farming business in Nigeria has completed itsrestructuring and started to report better results fromthe second half of 2017;
- Restructuring is underway to address cost structuresand product mix strategies at Olam Tomato Processorsin the USA; and
- Packaged Foods restarted production ofjuices andbeverages in Q3 2017 in its new factory. (Productionofjuices and beverages had ceased in April 2016following a fire incident.) A refreshed strategy, whichaddresses issues such as product differentiation,branding, distribution and cost optimisation, wasimplemented during the year.
Even as we focused on improving our capital efficienciesand cash generation, we have not sacrificed our longterm growth objectives across our 6 prioritised platforms.The growth initiatives in 2017 included the following:
- Edible Nuts: Expansion of acreage in almond, walnutand pistachio in the USA and Australia;
- Spices and Vegetable Ingredients: Upstream pepperfarming in Vietnam and Brazil;
- Cocoa: New powder facility in the USA;
- Coffee: Expansion of soluble coffee capacity in Vietnamand Spain and continued investments in coffeeplantations in Laos, Zambia, Tanzania and Brazil;
- Grains: Expansion of wheat milling capacity in Ghanaand Nigeria; construction of animal feed mills andhatchery in Nigeria; and
' Cotton: Continued investments in integrated cottonginning in Africa.

Peanuts processing in USA. Our processing volumeswere higher in 2017 on full-yearconsolidation ofvolumes from Brooks Peanut Company.
Animal Feed, Nigeria: The country's largest integratedanimal feed mill, poultry breeding farm and hatcherywas commissioned in September.

Summary of financial and operating results
Balance sheetanalysis
In 2017, ourtotal assets amounted to 85318.2 billion,which comprised S$8.6 billion of fixed assets, $837.3billion ofworking capital and $552.0 billion of cash. Thesewere funded by $356.6 billion of equity, $854.7 billion ofshon—term debt and $556.9 billion of long—term debt. Ourequity position improved by S$777.3 million mainly due tothe exercise ofwarrants and higher retained earnings.
Compared with 2016, our overall balance sheet shrankby $551.1 billion as working capital fell with lower inventorylevels and lower commodity prices during 2017. Fixedcapital went up by S$463.7 million primarily due to theCapex we made over the past year.
As mentioned, working capital came down signiﬁcantlywith reduced stock levels and lower commodity prices.Overall cycle time came down from 150 days in 2016
to 97 days in 2017. The change in product mix, lowercommodity prices and working capital optimisationinitiatives taken to improve inventory management helpedreduce overall inventory days. Reduced supplieradvances and receivables days also contributed to
a shorter cash conversion cycle.

Edible Nuts, Spicesand Vegetable Ingredients
The Edible Nuts, Spices and Vegetable Ingredients segment achieveda year-on-year volume growth 0f7.8% in 2017.
The increase came mainly from highervolumes in EdibleNuts, particularly cashew, almonds and sesame, as wellas spices. The tomato processing industry in the USAcontinued to suffer from the global supply glut and weakdemand necessitating restructuring measures to addresscost and product mix issues.
Revenues grew12.8% mainly on highervolumes. aswell as higher almond and cashew prices comparedwith 2016.
EBITDA grew by 32.1% as Edible Nuts performedstrongly in 2017 as compared with 2016 when itscontribution was impacted by depressed almond prices.
Earnings Before Interest, Tax,
Invested capital in the segment declined slightly byS$38.8 million as compared with 2016. This was acombination of a decrease in fixed capital on accountof the sale of edible huts farmland assets in the USAand an increase in working capital due to higher prices,especially in cashew and almonds.
EBITDA on average invested capital (EBITDA/IC) for thesegment therefore improved from 9.3% in 2016 to 12.1%in 2017,

Social: Continued focus on labour issues, yield andtraceability in hazelnuts
- 400,000 farmers in Turkey grow 70% ofthe world’shazelnuts. At harvest, farmers rely on a migrantworkforce estimated as high as 1.5 million people.This brings challenges, including child labour andwage issues, Olam Progida works with customers,competitors and the Fair LaborAssociation (FLA) toimprove working conditions, as well as help farmersimprove yields, which in turn can boost labourwages.
1. The results of IndependentAssessi-nents forAugust 2017 are notyet published
' The FLA noted in its 2016 assessment report that thepolitical turmoil and clashes in Kurdish-populated SouthEastern Turkey may have caused an increase in childlabour — some workers stated they had no choice but towork in the hazelnut harvest with their children to earnmoney, The FLA noted that in spite of companyattempts (Olam Progida plus 2 other companies in themonitoring programme) to reduce child labour, a totalof 99 child workers were detected within the seasonalworkforce as well as within the local and familyworkforce. Olam Progida has since doubled itssustainability team and developed further socialprojects with NGOs, local authorities and theInternational Labor Organization (ILO). Under theOlam Livelihood Charter the sustainability teamtrained 2,870 farmers specifically on labour issues.
- Additional outreach includes: Awareness raisingtraining for local authorities as well as labourcontractors and teachers. Training is also given to themigrant workers on issues such as gender equality,child labour and financial literacy.
~ See www.fairlabororg for the 2016 assessment(2017 to be published later in 2018).
Burcu Kugu Bolak, Project Director at FLA'sTurkey Office, comments:
“Together with the Fair LaborAssociation (FLA),Olam pursues a multi-stakeholder approach toresolving systemic Violations in the social domainof the hazelnut supply chain. This has boosted thesustainability of Olam's operations since 2014 whilecontributing to improving human rights throughouttheir supply chains.”

In 2017 Olam Progida in Turkey launched a projectwith the Foundation for the Support of Women’sWork (KEDV) called “Empowering Women andChildren at Hazelnut Harvest.” Along with otherOlam Progida sustainability programmes, this willhelp to reduce child and forced labour in thehazelnut harvest,

However, revenue growth was modest at 5.5% as thevolume growth was mostly offset by lower prices for bothcoffee and cocoa.
EBITDA declined 19.5% in 2017 due to a significantlylower contribution from Coffee. While it had a good ﬁrsthalf, tougher market conditions and short crop acrossmajor origins in the latter half of the year adverselyimpacted its overall EBITDA in 2017.

- Called 'EI Exito' ('Success'), the new facility in theindustrial township of Lurin, south of Lima, will broadenreach and market share, processing green coffeeprocured from buying points around the country.
- In Peru the supply chain is very fragmented, with223,000 farming families producing coffee over about380,000 ha. This makes it difficult for exporters to buysignificant volumes directly, and relying on manyintermediaries. Farmers struggle with yields clueto lack of training, access to quality seedlings ordegraded soil,
- In August, a Chain Reaction Research report from theconsortium of NGOs Aidenvironment, Climate Advisersand Profundo, stated that Olam faces reputational riskbecause ”Coffee has been identified as a major driver
of deforestation in the Peruvian Amazon However,
“no direct link between Olam Peru and deforestation
in the Peruvian coffee sector could be identified.
. The report highlighted the preventive steps taken by
Olam Peru which include:
- Direct procurement sustainability programmes (over1,300 farmers) with reforestation and training in GoodAgricultural Practices to improve yields, which in turnhelp to prevent farmers encroaching into fertile forest
- Assembled a core set of intermediary suppliers whocommit to upholding the Olam Supplier Code
- Promotion of third-party verification and certificationschemes in indirect procurement (70% is certified).Olam agronomists and field stafftrain smallholdersin Good Agricultural Practices to get the certificates.
- We also explained how a company needs to be in
the supply chain in order to change it; focusing on
remediation and education if smallholders are found to
be carrying out poor practices rather than necessarilyremoving them immediately from the supply chain.

To that end, Olam and Mighty Earth signed anagreement in February 2017 committing both partieson a number of points We agreed to a moratorium onfurther development of palm and rubber in Gabon togive time for stakeholders to develop further specificcriteria for sustainable agriculture in countries wheremost of the land is covered by forests We alsoupdated our Palm Policy to provide more clarity for oursuppliers on our No Deforestation, No Peat and NoExploitation sourcing requirements
We invited Mighty Earth to visit our plantations, theneighbouring villages and the High Conservation Valueareas we actively protect (72,000 ha inside ourconcessions), and meet with national NGOs and otherstakeholders. Ajoint update on the visit is available on
olamgrouptcom. Mighty Earth recognised theemployment opportunities and investment in socialinfrastructure provided by Olam and the efforts takento protect High Conservation Areas; but alsoexpressed reservations about the biodiversity andclimate impacts, and potential human rights impacts,of large scale plantation agriculture as a basis for therenewal of Gabon‘s rural economy.
In October Olam Palm Gabon invited The ForestsDialogue, 3 Yale»based programme which promotesmulti-stakeholder discussions on forest issues, toco-host a Dialogue in Gabont This was attended bymore than 50 stakeholders, including international andnational NGOs such as WWF, TNC, Forest PeoplesProgramme, WRI, BrainForest and Mighty Earth, aswell as industry, government, inter-governmentalorganisations. The Dialogue helped develop aroadmap and national plan of action which is beingtaken up by a Gabonese multi—stakeholder group
At the end of 2017, Olam’s Bilala oil palm mill andplantation was certified by RSPO, taking the overallcertified area managed by Olam to 55,400 has
On third party trading, more than 80% of crude palmoil and palm kernel oil volumes were successfullytraced using GPS co-ordinates, against a target of50% with roadmap metrics now available on a palmdashboard on olamgrouptcom.
The London Zoological Society (ZSL) ranks Olam 7thout of 50 against its Sustainability Policy TransparencyToolkit with a score of 779%. Responses to MightyEarth, Greenpeace and other NGOs on paIm-relatedmatters can be found on olamgroupcom

Olam’s palm plantations in Gabon are undertaken through a Joint Venture with the Republic of Gabon‘ We are
committed to 100% RSPO certification by 2021.

Manufactured: Owendo International Port, Gabon
- Managed by Gabon Special Economic Zone (GSEZ)8A1, the new multi-purpose port will become a leadingexport—import thoroughfare for West and Central Africa.With 2 berths and palm oil tanks, fuel storage and grainsilos, it can handle the loading and unloading of severalbulk cargo Panamax vessels simultaneously. Thetechnology, innovation and sustainability vision behindthe construction were recognised by the AfricaInvestments Forum & Awards with GSEZ winning thebest African project in the Port and AirportInfrastructure category.
Manufactured: Australia Cotton team unlocks FinancialCapital with Joint Ventures, and invests in construction
- A Joint Venture between subsidiary Queensland Cottonand Rural Funds Management (RFM) marks the entryinto upstream cotton growing in Australia. LynoraDowns currently has over 740 ha of irrigated cotton,1,200 ha of dryland cotton, as well as hectarage forwheat and chickpea crop rotation. Irrigation water issourced from natural overland flow and stored in 'cells’.All cotton will be ginned at Olam’s Moura Gin.
- On 1 March 2017, Queensland Cotton and EvolutionGinning commenced a new venture for thejointoperation of the Mungindi Gin. Evolution has significantcotton growers, bringing deep local knowledge as wellas cotton volumes.
- New 24/7 warehousing facilities at the Dalby and CecilPlains Gin sites have a combined footprint of over20,000 m2 and can store 150,000 bales. The expansionleverages existing assets, removes reliance on externalhandlers, and offers existing staff developmentopportunities. This initiative is expected to deliversignificant bale storage and handling cost savings,and create a highly efficient Gin to Port supply chain.
intellectual: Increasing the Iong-term economic valueof rubber trees through new tool
- A new precision, mechanised rubber tapping tool isbeing developed by Olam in collaboration withMechanovation Sdn Bhd and Detroit EngineeredProducts that will automate the delicate process torelease latex without damaging the tree. Using acambium sensor it reduces reliance on highly—skilledlabour while simultaneously increasing productivity.
Human: Constant focus on safety in rubber plantations
- A stringent Health & Safety mindset is a relatively newconcept to workers in the Gabon rubber and palmplantations who come from the surrounding villages.Constant vigilance and awareness training arerequired. Tragically, one fatality was recorded at theBitam rubber plantation due to transportation. A trainerdedicated to providing defensive driving courses andimplementing road safety management has beenrecruited. A revised road policy is reinforced by setspeed limits, speed limiters 0n Olam and contractorvehicles, random speed checks and alcohol screening,and more road safety signage
Social: Linking communities to financial andhealthcare services
- Rubber processmg subsidiary SAIC (Sociéte Agro-Industrielle de la Comoe) in Céte d’Ivoire is helpingsmallholders access bank loans Banks were hesitantas most crop payments were made by processors incash, and transactions could not be tracked. With SAIChelping to maintain accounts in microfinancecooperatives, banks are now able to estimate therequired transaction, enabling farmers to secure loans.Over the course of 2016 and 2017, more than 2,000rubber growers working with SAIC gained their firstbank accounts, encouraging farmer loyalty.
- In the Republic of Congo, subsidiary CongolaiseIndustrielle des Bois (CIB) successfully renewed FSC®certification? for 1.3 million hectares (ha). The team isworking towards certification of the most recentconcession of 671 ,000 ha.

- CIB is the largest employer in the region (994 people).and the only major provider of healthcare acrossapproximately 20,000 km2 with 58,000 people, the vastmajority living in poorvillages or as semi—nomadictribes‘ CIB operates a 42 bed hospital and another 36beds across 4 rural clinics. Both chronic and infectiousdiseases are rife in this area and, in 2017, over 21,500patients were treated who were not CIB employees
- In 2016, the CIB doctor, with an NGO healthcareproject, travelled to a remote group of villages,previously only accessible by canoe, along a road justbuilt by CIB at the villages’ request During this trip, themedical team treated many children for malaria andmalnutrition, The CIB medical team returned a fewweeks later and many more children and adults weretreated by the medical team with some beingevacuated to the CIB hospital. Tragically, there werestill many deaths.
- In August 2017, two Congolese NGOs (OCDH andRENAPAC) issued a report stating that the roadbuilding itself had caused an increase in malaria, whichin turn caused high child mortality.
~ To investigate the allegations CIB requested advicefrom the NGO The Malaria Consortium. On theirrecommendation an independent tropical diseasespecialist was commissioned. The report findings show:
~ While malaria is endemic in the region it was not thesingle or main cause of death
- The final cause was split mainly between dysentery,malaria, pneumonia and measles
~ The road was assessed to have not made a relevantimpact on the breeding of malarial mosquitoes due tothe surrounding marsh (flooded forest) landscapewhich provided enormous permanent breedingground potential forthe mosquitos.
- These villages are affected by immense poverty,malnutrition and many negative social factors,facilitating the spread of deadly diseases. The deep,systemic healthcare issues underpinning this tragedycannot be solved by any one party acting alone and itwill require a renewed focus on effective delivew ofhealthcare forthe region. In this, CIB will continue towork with the Government, national and internationalNGOs, and experts to find a durable solution to helpcommunities living in the forest.

Rubbertapping in Céte d’Ivoire‘
Natural: Supporting development ofa SustainableNatural Rubber Standard to reduce deforestation
- Similar to other smallholder crops, rubber is also facingquestions on deforestation, community and labour rights.As yet, there is no industrywide platform for stakeholdersaddressing these issues and therefore there lacks acommon understanding of “sustainable rubber.
- Olam has been working with major tyre manufacturers,producers and civil society like the SustainableAgriculture Network (SAN), Global Witness, BirdlifeInternational, Rainforest Alliance, Proforest and otherson a white paper to develop a Sustainable NaturalRubber Standard. A risk—based rather than rule basedcertification approach is recommended. The NGONepcon explains: “It allows the greatest level of effortto be placed on the areas with the highest risks.
A conventional approach to certification, on the otherhand, requires effort to be put into all the listedrequirements, no matter whether they pose a significantrisk to company in question or not. A risk-basedapproach would ultimately make certification viable forsmallholders and small-scale farmers. It would enablecertification to drive positive changes in areas wherethere is need for change, without exposingsmallholders to the high costs of a conventionalcertification process.

In the Upstream segment, while fully contributing (mature) businesses such as almonds met targeted returns, otherfully contributing businesses like Daily and Rice farming had not yet reached full potential in terms of earningsexpectations due to underperformance in previous years, although these had shown positive trajectory in 2017. Thisled to an EBITDA/IC return of 7.8% against ourtarget of 15-18%. A total of S$1 .8 billion of invested capital is stillgestating (not yielding any EBITDA) or partly contributing (not fully mature). Gestating businesses, such as the Coffeeand Rubber plantations, are expected to move into the partly contributing stage as they grow, while partly contributingones, mainly the palm plantations in Gabon, are expected to become fully contributing as they reach full maturity.
EBITDA/IC for the Supply Chain segment was dragged down by the underperformance in Coffee and Cocoa to 7.3%in 2017 (2016: 88%) even as working capital optimisation initiatives helped reduce overall invested capital deployedby 11.2% from a year ago.
In the Mid/Downstream segment, a total of $394.1 billion of invested capitai were in fully contributing assets and theseinclude the wheat milling businesses in West Africa, the Edible Oils refining and distribution business in Mozambiqueas well as the GSEZ investments in ports, which came onstream in 2017. These yielded an EBITDA/[C return of 12.4%,which is below target as the result was impacted by the underperformance in the tomato processing and PackagedFoods businesses. Some $532.1 billion of invested capital was partly contributing as these businesses had not reachedsteady-state levels of production.
All in all, $253.9 billion of total investments already made are either gestating or partly contributing, which means theseinvestments are expected to give incremental earnings over time as they grow to full potential.

Mid/Downstream
The Mid/Downstream segment had a healthy volumegrowth of 18.6% in 2017. The growth in volumes wasmainly coming from the Grains and Animal Feed platform,the Peanut business in the USA and cashew processingoperations in Vietnam. Wheat milling capacity in Nigeriaand Ghana increased during the year which led to highermilling volumes. The Animal Feed business in Nigeriaalso started contributing in 2017. Peanut volumes in theUSA were higher on fuII-year consolidation of volumesfrom Brooks Peanut Company.
Despite larger sales volumes, revenues were flat due tolower prices across most products, including cocoa,tomatoes, dehydrates and sugar.
EBITDA was higher by 11.1% in 2017 compared with2016. This was primarily on account of the improvementin wheat milling in West Africa, fuII-year consolidation ofresults from Brooks and strong contribution from GSEZafter its commissioning of new ports and partial sale ofport concession rights. These improvements were offsetby lower results from tomato processing and thePackaged Foods Business in Nigeria.
Invested capital was lower by S$233.9 million in 2017,largely arising from the reduction in working capital. Thiswas due to optimisation initiatives for cocoa as well as thelower prices of tomatoes and dehydrates.
The increase in EBITDA on lower invested capital liftedEBITDA/IC from 9.7% in 2016 to 11.1% in 2017.

Challenges and influencing Factors in 2017
- Downward pressure on commodity prices coupled withcost efﬁciency drives can impact teams. Reduced scoreswere seen in 2017 in employee engagement. The launchof our new purpose — ‘Re—imagining Global Agriculture:Growing Responsibly’ — is a critical facet of improvingengagement. We are also now starting to measureengagement more formally across all employees.
- Embedding a safety culture in emerging marketswhere there is less focus culturally on safe behaviour—for example, driving within the speed limit, wearing ofseat belts. Tragically, 7 fatalities occured in 2017primarily through transportation—related incidents. Othercauses included incorrect wearing of safety equipmentand supervision issues.

Spotlight on living wages
At the coffee plantations in Tanzania (Aviv) andZambia (NCCL), Olam employs over 1,300 workersfrom the surrounding villages and many more atharvest. Whilst this has brought economic and skillsbenefits, the team is exploring whether the legal minimumwage could also be considered a ‘Iiving wage.‘
A study using the Anker methodology showed a gap,so the plantations are looking at ways to reduce itwithin the parameters of business viability. Indeed, inabsolute terms, simply raising wages is often not thesolution. improving living conditions ratherthan just
increasing a salary can be more cost-eﬁective andachieve more focused impact.
AtAviv, for instance, we have helped workers enrollin the Community Health Fund. This covers basicmedical expenses for the worker plus 5 familydependents for one year. Equally, we are givingworkers guidance on how to grow more nutritiousfood in their smallholdings; as well as improvinghealth and sanitation in the villages through variousactivities related to the Alliance for Water Stewardship(AWS) Standard.

Social Capital
Given our dependence on 4.76 million farmers, the vastmajomty being smallholders in emerging markets, thedeﬁnition of Social Capital by the OECD as “networkstogether with shared norms, values and understandingsthat facilitate co—operation within or among groups” ispamcularty resonant. Much of ourfocus therefore is onlifting smallholders out of poverty. To secure the crops forcustomers tomorrow, we must help rural communities tothrive today‘ In turn, this delivers economic value forthecoun’mes where we operate,
Large—scale farmers also face many challenges. Often 3rdor 4‘h generation family farms, they have grown throughhard work, perseverance and sacrifice. While Olam’sextensive farmgate experience means we are well-placedto support farmers from America to Zimbabwe, we mustwork in partnership to achieve the scale of transformationalchange required in the agricultural sector.
Currently, there is no single methodology to put afinancial vatue on all elements identified under SocialCapital creation. 80, as a ‘stepping stone', we aremeasuring the investments we make in socialinfrastructure and impacts on livelihoods.

Overview
2017 was a year marked by profound political andeconomic changes around the world. Key developmentsin areas including global trade, financial and capitalmarkets, environment and climate change, geo—politicalcontexts, and consolidation in the agri—sector continuedunabated through the course of the year. I am pleasedto report that against this challenging backdrop,
Olarn‘s clear and differentiated strategy, coupled with keyinitiatives that we undertook to accelerate the delivery oflong-term value to both our continuing shareholders andother key stakeholders yielded outstanding results.
We grew top line in terms of both sales volume and salesrevenue by 56.3% and 27.6% respectively, improvedbottom line with reported PATMI and Operational PATMIgrowing by 65.3% and 18.6% respectively, enhancedreturns with ROE improving by 290 basis points to 9.0%.and EBITDA/ Invested Capital improving by 40 basispoints to 8.2%, delivered record free cash ﬂows of $891.5billion in FCFF and $551.02 billion in FCFE, and materiallyreduced net gearing from 1.99x as at end-December2016 to 1.46x as at end-December 2017.
We also continued to invest for the future with grosscapex expenditure of 8359706 million in 2017 largely inour prioritised platforms. Nearly 24.7% or 8533.9 billionof ourtotal invested capital of S$15.8 billion as of
31 December 2017 is still gestating or only partiallycontributing at this stage, laying a strong foundationfor future profitable growth from these gestatinginvestments. We have thus balanced both theshort-term and long-term well.
In addition to investing selectively in a configurationof upstream (plantation), midstream (manufacturing)and supply chain assets, our progress in deliveringthese results is also a function of continually makingimportant investments to build our capabilities,people and systems.
While we are pleased with these results and outcomes,we are prouder still that we have achieved this profitablegrowth in a more consistent, responsible and sustainableway. The progress made in all our businesses during theyear, both in financial terms as well as our positive impacton people and planet, is proof that our commitment tomaximising value and purpose concurrently is the rightbalance. Our sustainability initiatives in 2017 across ourvarious businesses have offered us tangible benefits,
1. Stockholm Resilience Centre
including better pricing power, more customer stickiness,and a larger share of ourcustomers’ wallet. At the sametime, we have also positively impacted the communitieswhere we operate and reduced our negative impacts onthe environment. Specific examples of these sustainabilityinitiatives are detailed in the review of the variousreporting segments (see pages 46 to 66) as well as thereporting on the various Capitals (see pages 68 to 88).We believe that putting sustainability at the heart of
our business is fundamental to our strategy of building
a business that is more consistent, sustainable
and enduring.
In this regard, we believe that Olam must become
more innovative and find new ways of doing things tobetter manage our impact on the 9 Planetary Boundaries‘,and help achieve the 17 UN Sustainable DevelopmentGoals (SDGs), particularly SDG Goal 2 “End hunger,achieve food security and improved nutrition, andpromote sustainable agriculture. As a company. andindeed as part of the larger agri-sector, we need to findways of producing more of the right kind of food usingfewer resources in terms of land, water, farm inputs andelimination of waste to meet the rapidly growing globaldemand for food, feed, fibre and fuel. At Olam, we
have recognised these challenges and have takenconcrete measures (as explained in the latersectionsof this report) to address them so that we, and ourstakeholders, can continue to responsibly and profitablygrow in the future.
Key industry trends and Ulam's response
Trade and Contestability of Global Output
The new US Administration, which focused on tax reform,regulation and immigration issues in its first year in office,has now turned its attention to trade policy with potentiallyserious consequences forthe global economy.
In addition to the adverse impact of the USAdministration’s immigration policy on the availability
of farm workers, recent US trade actions includingwithdrawing from the TPP, re-negotiating NAFTA,re-negotiation of the Korea—US Free Trade Agreement,tariffs on solar panels and washing machines, tariffs
on steel and aluminium, the USTR's investigation ofChina's industrial policies and technology transferpractices, and its recent launch of a WTO challengeagainst India over its export subsidies, have all beenactions that have amplified uncertainty around
global trade.

Supporting Science-Based Targets
In 2016, Olam signed up to the Science—BasedTargets Initiative which seeks to increase thenumber of companies reducing their GreenhouseGas (GHG) emissions. This is to ensure alignmentto a 2 degree Celsius global warming scenario,and companies should pursue efforts to limit theincrease to 1.5 degrees Celsius, At the beginningof 2018 we submitted these targets to the Initiativeand are awaiting their feedback,
As part of this process, during 2017 we undertook areview and set ourselves stretch targets to reduceGHGs by 50% by 2030 both in our own operationsand in our supply chain. This requires a reductionof 3.85% per year,
By 2050, we aspire to be carbon positive inoperations, requiring a 5% emissions reductionper year from 2031 — 2050, We are developingstretch targets for our supply chain. We are alsoexploring how to set similar operational targets forwater by reviewing global regions at risk of waterstress and agriculture-Iinked pollution.

Olam Living Landscapes Policy — seeking net positive impact
In 2017, we consulted widely with experts and civilsociety on a forest policy to cover all commodities inOlam‘s portfolio. We concluded that a Policy basednarrowly on unacceptable land use managementpractices will not be sufficient to meet the challengesof deforestation and ecosystem degradation.
As part of our ambition to re—imagine global agriculturewe have therefore adopted a Living LandscapesPolicy. We aim to delivera triple positive impact in theplaces where we work to create and sustain livinglandscapes, where profitable farms and plantations,thriving rural communities, and healthy ecosystemscoexist. For example, around our plantations in Gabon
our net—positive contribution includes thousands ofjobs, social infrastructure, High Conservation Valueareas and anti—poaching enforcement, and net positiveclimate impact1
Going forward, each Olam business will take a risk-based approach to establish strategies and plansappropriate to our role in growing, sourcing, processingand trading each crop and commodity Timeboundcommitments are incorporated into the Policy (2018 and2020). To ensure successful application of this Policygroup—wide we will develop and implement a suitableprocess to monitor compliance with the Policy.

Intellectual Capital—
lfwe are to truly re-imagine the global agri-sector thenIntellectual Capital must be prized and nurtured acrossour entire business from the farm, through trading, to
logistics and processing.
This is made possible by the skills and competenciesinherent in our Human Capital, as well as dedication totalent attraction and retention But we must also recognisethat as the world continues to experience rapid changesdriven by technology, the farms and factories of the futuremay not look like those of today and that new skills,competencies and intellectual Capital will be required.
Intellectual Capital is defined by the InternationalIntegrated Reporting Council as organisational,knowledgebased intangibles including intellectualproperty, such as patents, copyrights, software;organisational capital such as tacit knowledge, systemsand protocols; and intangibles associated with brand andreputation — we have extracted the latter as a separatecapital given its importance. At this stage we are stillconsidering impact accounting methodologies over andabove ﬁnancial reporting.
A critical contributing factor to our Intellectual Capitalhas been our focused strategy and differentiatedbusiness model, coupled with the strength and on-the—
ground experience of our talent base, particularly in thetough-terrain emerging markets where they have grownhighly proﬁtable businesses. Through the ‘The OlamWay‘, we have carefully applied our Intellectual Capital tobuild a highly defensible business where we have aunique participation portfolio.
Intellectual Capital — desired outcomes
- Consistently out-perform the sector through strategyand innovation
» Partner of choice for customers through differentiation
- Agile business to maximise emerging trends and adaptto rapidly changing business environment
- Sustainable sourcing scaled much more quickly
» Brand equity and reputation grows
- Inspired employees strive for more
- Employer of choice
- Become trusted implementation partner forcustomers, NGOs, development finance institutions,governments etc.

Digitalisation was identified as a vision enabler so theDigital Task Force was established in 2017, Together withIT, it supports the business to realise disruptive ideas andoperational efficiencies, offering new revenue streamsand cost savings through automation, e-commerce andsustainable sourcing.
Of critical importance is how technology can drive thepace of change so badly required among smallholdersupply chains. With more than 4 million farmers in ourindirect sourcing network, very few companies have thesame number of touch points through which to cascadechanges The DTF identlfled 4 key areas:
Increasing the opportunity to sell directly to Olamrather than having to go through intermediaries (see theOlam Direct story on page 30)
Improving yields through crop analysis and bestpractice guidance
Empowering farmers by creating a conduciveenvironment for the exchange of information 7 nowpossible with just a mobile phone if the rightinfrastructure is in place
Improving farmers' access to technology, particu arlythrough mobile phones which in turn can bring accessto wider banking servlces and financial inclusion.
Culture: success of digitalisation requires a big as ofall stakeholders in terms of being open amid change
and being receptive to new ideasInfrastructure development: requires working closelywith Telecoms suppliers and governments need toinvest in the infrastructure base. Even SMS networ sare good enough as a starting link to many services.Through collaboration we can increase the pace ofchange — and potentially have wider economic benefitsas local hotbeds of tech sawy communities estab ish

We are developing an autonomous technology ca ledVertebrate Pest Detection and Deter System (VPDad)for detecting and sustainably deterring animals likeelephants from destroying crops. It is being developedin collaboration with the Commonwealth Scientific andIndustrial Research Organization of Australia (CSRO).The technology uses several reactive ‘sense-and-deter’nodes that emit sounds and lights, warning anima saway from plantations without harm.
AgriPaI, a mobile app, is being developed to capturereal-time data on the ground to monitor workerproductivity, crop production and quality, as well asnutrient and palm stress, enabling fast response.

Our Core Purpose of Re—imagining Global Agricultureopens up the valuable opportunity to createdifferentiated Intellectual Capital for Olam.
By embedding sustainability in our commercialactivities, refining our social and environmentalpolicies, and developing our data managementcapabilities, we are evolving our business model tocapture value.
In 2017, we started to develop AtSource, a majorinnovation in sustainable product delivery whichenables Olam and our customers to track product ona path from responsible sourcing through to a netpositive impact on people and planet (see page 16)‘
For Olam, the development of AtSource has generatedand disseminated sustainability knowledge from top tobottom of our organisation, across 4 net positiveprinciples. and by its nature and expansion into otherproducts will continue to do so:
Understanding the expectations of stakeholders insustainable supply chains (e.g. peers, customersand civil society)
Understanding the evolving global sustainabilitystandards in our sector
Assessing how Olam can build a competitiveadvantage through differentiated sustainableproducts contributing to positive impacts beyondcompliance at farm level and at scale.
Individual smallholder farms in remote rural regionscan now be GPS mapped and surveyed via anAndroid app with the uploaded data harnessed toprovide tailored support for smallholders and moreprecise details to customers who need to make criticalchoices about financial interventions, such as agri-training, school or healthcare infrastructure.
For cooperatives and farmer groups: commercialmanagement services to better manage stock,creditor and debtor levels
For smallholders: detailed farm mapping formore tailored support including individual farmmanagement plans, text advice and mobilepayment wallets
For customers: improved transparency andintervention insight to reduce supply chain risk andimprove funding efficiency.
Collating data and KPIs that are material, relevantand verifiable in order to track and guidesustainability initiatives for different products inmany origins
Footprinting our products with auditable methodsPackaging the key information for our customersin a compelling and easily accessible wayCommunicating both the challenges andopportunities of Olam‘s complex world
Generating a detailed understanding of thesustainability dimensions of our supply Chains tocatalyse partnerships with customers and with otherpartners to achieve our goals‘
Promoting a systematic focus across ourAtSource products on key management practicesthat contribute to incremental improvements
in performance.
Creating a framework for producing net positiveproducts, which contribute to prosperous farmers,thriving communities and healthy ecosystems inliving landscapes.
AtSource has aiso helped Olam to upgrade ourcapability to use digital technology to enhancetransparency, inform deoision-making and supportcollaboration with partners.

The reaction of China on imposing counter measureson US sorghum imports, and the threatened retaliatoryaction by the European Union, have all increased theodds of a potential trade wart The Canadian solarcompanies have since filed a lawsuit over these tariffsand the European Union along with China, Taiwan andKorea have claimed compensation for these solartariffs from the USA This global tit—for—tat on tradeissues could disrupt many supply chains around theworld. As far as the agri-sector is concerned, webelieve targeted agricultural sector reciprocal tariffs(including on USA corn, soybean. rice. sorghum, dairyand cotton exports) could be the most likely countermeasures adopted by countries like China againstthese US trade moves because it is relatively moreeasy to accurately size the retaliation as required inthese agri-commodities and also because agri»commodity products are easier to substitute awayfrom. The top 3 importers of US agricultural products.collectively accounting for 42% or US$58] billionworth of ag exports in 2017 are Canada, China andMexico, with China alone accounting for more than30% (US$149 billion in value) and Mexico accountingfor 13% of all US ag exports‘. Additionally, becausethese agricultural products come from rural districts
in the USA which are more likely to have voted for theRepublican Administration and Republicans inCongress, China, European Union, Mexico and
other countries believe that tariffs on agriculture couldpotentially apply more political pressure on the USAdministration. These developments could potentiallyshrink the role of the USA as a global ag supplier
and allow its global customers to diversify away fromUS ag exports.
All of these measures and counter measures wouldresult in reduced contestability of global output (globalGDP that is free from tariffs, non—tarif‘f trade barriers,and otherforms of protection), slow down global tradeand consequently pose a significant headwind foreconomic growth.
In order to better navigate these trade issues, Olam isfocused on staying diversified across key producingcountries for the various commodities we supply.
As a rule of portfolio selection, we participate in80-90% of the countries that produce a givencommodity In addition, we are also increasing our

Demand drivers
Growing world population will continue to drivegrowth in food, feed, fibre and fuel demand.
The current world population of 74 billion is expectedto reach 83 to 85 billion by 2030 and 9.5 to 9.7 billionby 2050 under a medium fertility scenarioz. Growth
in the global middle class population estimated at
3 billion in 2015 (doubling from 1.5 billion in 2010) isexpected to rise to 4 billion by 2021, with China andIndia alone accounting fora significant portion ofthatgrowth. Calorie consumption per capita is expectedto increase 20% as populations in these developingeconomies transition from low income to middleincome status? Changes in dietary habits and shift
in food consumption patterns from food staples andcarbohydrates to protein and fat—based diets willalso drive increased demand forfood and feed rawmaterials. Increasing diversion of crops into biofuelmanufacturing is also a new driver of demand. All ofthese demand side drivers will combine to increasedemand for crops between 60% (on a calorific valuebasis) to 100% (on a total crop production basis)

New market trends on the growth of functional foods,the aversion to artificial ingredients, the imposition ofsugar sweetened beverage tax (egg. in Mexico, SouthAfrica, United Kingdom, Singapore, Malaysia etc.),fatty food tax (eg, in Hungary), calorie informationmenu labelling, mandated dieting classes

Risk Management
Olam has a rigorous risk management framework designedto identify and assess the likelihood and impact of risks,and to manage the actions necessary to mitigate impact.
The process identifies risks from a top-down strategicperspective and a bottom-up business perspective.Overall responsibility to monitor and assess risk lies withOlam’s independent risk function (Risk Ofﬁce)
We take a holistic approach to enterprise—wide risk,monitoring across each value—chain step and a widerange of both quantifiable and non—quantifiable risks.
Risk Governance Structure
- Olam has an institutionalised process in thegovernance of risk management matters: our Chief Risk& Compliance Officer (CRCO) is a member of theExecutive Committee and reports to both the CEO andthe Chair of the Board Risk Committee (BRO), whichcomprises the Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
- The BRC is also supported by the Executive RiskCommittee (ERC)‘ The ERC comprises key executivesfrom the senior management team who support the riskgovernance process by promoting risk culture, approvinglarge exposures and mediating large breaches.
- The Risk Office reports to the CRCO and is responsiblefor identifying, assessing, measuring and monitoringrisks, to provide Olam‘s senior management and theBoard with assurance that all the risks borne are withinour risk tolerance The Risk Office is responsiblefor risk monitoring and control on an independentbasis and undertakes regular stress—testing of thecompany’s portfolio
Olam Risk Architecture Development
Ulam Risk Policy
- Risk limits are set as part of the annual budgetingcycle, which are presented to the Board for approval.These limits — outright, basis, structure, arbitrage andValue—at—Risk (VaR) as well as credit and counterpartylimits — are set based on various factors such as riskversus return, volatility of past earnings, adherence tolimits and maximum loss limits derived from scenarioand stress—testingt The number of years in business,strength of the management team, prevailing marketconditions and the macro—economic outlook arealso considered,
- The CRCO is mandated to allocate the risk capitalacross businesses considering the competitiveposition, trading and market conditions and the trackrecord of each business Performance is continuouslymonitored. and risk capital allocation is recalibratedwhere necessary. The assigned limits are set at alllevels of hierarchy within the structure, ie at business-unit level. value-chain step level and at profit—centrelevel, as well as any other limits the Risk Officedeems appropriate.

Enterprise Risk Management
Oiam's Enterprise Risk Management framework defines 51 individual risks across 11 categories.
Of the 51 risks, 16 are evaluated on a quantitative basis and represented in the company’s Group Risk Dashboard
(GRD), the output of which is presented to the BRC each quarter. This report allows segmental analysis of earningssensitivity for 12 of the 16 quantifiable risks at Cluster level, business unit level and at the value-chain step level and
the remaining four at the company level.
The Enterprise Risk Scorecard (ERS) is the result of an assessment of each of the 51 risks for likelihood of occurrenceand impact Each risk is evaluated for each Business Unit both on an inherent and residual basis using a traﬁic—Iightsystem of red-amber—green. Inherent risks are the threats that an activity poses in the absence of any mitigating factorsin place; residual risks are those that remain after mitigations are considered
The ERS is also presented to the BRC on a quarterly basis which. in conjunction with the GRD assists the Board with(i) examining the effectiveness of the Olam’s risk management plans, systems, processes and procedures and
(ii) reviewing company—wide risk policies, guidelines and limits, as well as risk exposure and risk treatment plans. TheBoard is responsible for approving the overall risk capital of the company at the start of the financial yeart Risk capital.expressed as a percentage of the equity capital of the company, refers to the maximum potential loss if all the tradingrisks across all product—types and geographic regions materialise at the same time‘
Key controls and miﬁgalions How Olam is positioned
Trading risks Trading risks are controlled by regular monitoring of positions using industry-standard metrics.The annual risk budgeting process defines position and risk metric limits to control exposures.
Olam hedges price risk on the world's commodities exchanges, both through derivativesand tendering.
Operational risks Field operating control and primary sourcing infrastructure are in place in every country whereOlam operates.
Our credit/counterparty rating system defines credit limits and controls, promotingfragmentation of credit exposure on short tenors.

Risk Measurement
- Olam continually upgrades our risk measurementmethodology in line with industry best practices. Wefocus on the measurement of quantity, dollar value,diversified VaR and stress testing to determine potentialimpact of adverse market events on the books. Analysisof return drivers provides a clear attribution of returnsagainst risk and allows an independent flagging ofoutsized 0r undesired risk.
- The VaR methodology calculates the potential lossarising from the commodity price, credit, counterpartyand currency risks to which it is exposed.
- Market risk (Le. commodity price risk and currency risk)VaR is calculated over a one-day time horizon with a95% confidence level for each product in the portfolio.Credit and counterparty risk VaR may be computed byapplying default rates (based on counterparty ratings)and underlying commodity volatilities as appropriate
Market Compliance Controls
- One of Oiam’s key priorities is to comply with the higheststandards of business conduct. The Market ComplianceOffice (MCO) is responsible for ensuring regulatorycompliance for the derivative trading units. The MCOcarries out regular trader training courses to ensurefamiiiarity with prevailing exchange rules globally andensures that ail new hires are comprehensively trained inOlam’s Trading Compliance Manual.
Risk Training and Communication
- Olam has iaid out risk policies that guide newcomers onthe risks they wiil be required to manage and the risksystems that require timely and accurate reporting. TheRisk Office frequently presents to the Olam’s most seniormanagement bodies, the purpose of which is to enablethe continuai reinforcement of the control environmentand alignment of risk culture and awareness across thecompany. From time to time, the Risk Ofﬁce publishesadvisories on pertinent matters to raise awareness andto promote industry best practices.

Engaging stakeholders to re-imagine agriculture
Olam has a vast global network of stakeholders: customers,farmer suppliers and their communities, investors,employees, NGUs, financiers, foundations, trade bodies,industry platforms and governments. Business units,functions and country teams interact with them every day.
As an agricultural company, how we manage social andenvironmental issues are common questions from acrossthe stakeholder spectrum. We have a dedicatedCorporate Responsibility & Sustainability (CR&S)Function. as well as sustainability experts embedded inbusinesses across the world Achieving our CR&Sambition to be a net positive company requires thesupport of stakeholders in strategic alliances andpartnerships to catalyse system change togethert
We consult on a regular basis on policy consultation, (eg.the Living Landscapes Policy), on implementation of HighConservation Value (HCV) and Free Prior & InformedConsent Procedures (FPIC), through stakeholder events,or in response to reports and questions. By listening anddiscussing issues together we share understanding of ourbusiness, learn, and often find opportunities forpartnerships.
The vast majority of our stakeholders want to achieve thesame outcomes as Olam — profitable farms and farmingsystems, thriving rural communities and regeneration ofthe living world — even if we don’t always necessarilyagree on the exact way forward. Throughout this
report we have aimed to transparently cover notableengagements and stakeholderconcerns in the last year.(See Confectionery and Beverage ingredients pages
50 to 53; Food Staples and Packaged Foods pages
54 to 57 and Industrial Raw Materials pages 58 to 61.)A tabular overview of our stakeholder engagement isavailable in our 2017 Global Reporting Initiative (GRI)report on olamgroup.com.
In 2017, we also undertook more detailed mapping andprioritisation of our stakeholders at an international andnational level, to understand how we could bettercommunicate and manage relationships. This activity willbe continued in 2018, working with individual BusinessUnits, Countries and Functions.
Sustainability Strategy and Materiality
During 2017 we began a review of the over—archingsustainability strategy‘ This was brought into sharperfocus with the launch of the new purpose: Re—imaginingGlobal Agriculture : Growing Responsibly.
We recognised that we needed to betteralign ourmaterial areas with the 9 planetary boundaries, as well asconsider the Capitals under integrated reporting. Inaddition, we must also consider the targets of the UNSustainable Development Goals. the UN Global Compact,stakeholder priorities, reporting standards such as theGlobal Reporting Initiative and, of course, individualBusiness Unit priorities. The learnings and stakeholderfeedback from the development of Olam AtSource andthe Olam Landscapes Policy have also had considerableinfluence. See the Group CEO Review for an overview ofnew CR&S framework with 10 Material Areas which weredeveloped in 2018‘
Reporting against the current 7 Material Area goals andtargets are listed under the Relevant Capitals as follows:
. Seeiai: Livelihoods, Food Security- Land, Water, and Climate Change- Human: Labour
- Manufactured: Food Safety (owned by Manufacturing& Technical Services)
Additional [IRES priorities during 2018
- Olam Supplier Code: train Business Units on newtopics, implement revised risk-based processes andembed AtSource supply chain assessment acrossbusinesses
- Olam Plantations, Concessions and Farms Code:review to include new material areas, develop/implement action plans and report on progress
- Olam Landscapes Policy: establish advisory group,continue to assess deforestation risk for priorityproducts and regions, mapping high risk suppliers
- Accelerate impact of Business Unit-wise CR&Sstrategies with 2030 targets and milestones

Mapping SDG targets material to Ulam's business
As part of the CR&S strategy refresh, and analysis of our current material areas, we have also reviewed the specifictargets of the 17 UN Sustainable Development Goals. Of the 167 targets, we identified around 55 (allowing for someoverlaps) that are material to our business to a greater or lesser degree. We have then assessed them against ourability to influence the target as well as stakeholder priority. We have also started to look at the targets in terms ofidentifying opportunities to innovate and lead. This process will feed into our continuing work on our refreshed CR&Sframework for 2018 onwards. Our Global Reporting Initiative report on olamgroupcom also gives insight and analysisof our material areas grouped according to the appropriate GRI topic.
