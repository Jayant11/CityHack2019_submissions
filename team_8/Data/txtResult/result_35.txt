The ﬁnancial instruments traded on a regulated market are assessed at the closing price on the daybefore the calculation day of the net asset value, When these financial instruments are traded onseveral regulated markets at the same time, the chosen closing price is the one of the regulatedmarket in which they are primarily traded.
However, in the absence of signiﬁcant transactions on a regulated market, the following financialinstruments are assessed using the following speciﬁc methods:
- Negotiable debt securities (“NDS”) having a residual life upon acquisition that is less than orequal to 3 months are assessed with a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of thedifference between the acquisition value and the redemption value, The management companynevertheless reserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case ofparticular sensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalentsecurity issues allocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
- NDS, of which the residual lifespan at acquisition is greater than 3 months but of which theresidual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is equal to or less than 3 months, are assessedby means of a linear distribution, over the residual lifespan, of the difference between the lastadopted current value and the reimbursement value. The management company neverthelessreserves the possibility of assessing these securities at the current value in case of particularsensitivity to market risks (rates, etc.). The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer;
— NDS, of which the residual lifespan 0n the net asset value closing date is greater than 3 months,are assessed at their current values The chosen rate is that of the equivalent security issuesallocated to the risk margin related to the issuer,
- Firm future ﬁnancial instruments traded an organised markets are assessed at the clearing priceon the day before the calculation day of the net asset value. Conditional future financialinstruments traded on organised markets are assessed at the market value on the day of the netasset value. Over-the-counter ﬁrm or conditional future ﬁnancial instruments are assessed at theprice given by the ﬁnancial instrument‘s counterparty. They are presented in the off—balancesheet on the basis of the nominal value defined in the contract.
In the event of the holding of an EMTN, it will be valued on the basis of a market price given by
the financial instrument’s counterparty,
The management company independently carries out a verification of this assessment.
- Deposits are assessed at their nominal value, plus any related interest that has accrued.
- Subscription warrants, cash certiﬁcates, promissory notes and mortgage notes are assessed attheir probable market value, under the management company‘s responsibility.
— Units and equities in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities operatingunder French law are assessed at the last net asset value known on the calculation date of theMF’s net asset value
— Units and equities of UCITSating under foreign law are assessed at the last unit net asset valueknown on the calculation date of the MF’s net asset value.

Benchmark indicator revision
The Benchmark indicator is reviewed quatterly, in order to take into account changes affecting a stock’s marketcapitalisation (number of securities and free ﬂoat) or its classiﬁcation by sectori The principal changes in a company’scapital structure may be implemented in real time (merger or acquisition, large rights issues or IPOs).
The MSCI rules for Benchmark indicator revision are published by MSCI and are available on MSCI website:www.mscibarraicomi
The rebalancing frequency indicated above does not affect the cost of implementing the Investment strategy.
Benchmark Indicator Qublication
The ofﬁcial MSCI indices are calculated on a daily basis at closing prices using the official closing stock market pricesfor the constituent stocks The Benchmark Indicator is also calculated in real time every banking day‘
The Benchmark Indicator is available in real time Via Reuters and Bloomberg.
Reuters code: .dMIINOOOONUS
Bloomberg code: NDEUSIA
The Benchmark Indicator‘s closing price is available on MSCI website: www.mscibarra.com.
Investment strategy:
1. Strategy emgloyedThe MF will comply with the investment rules dictated by the European directive no‘ 2009/65/EC dated 13 July 2009‘
In pursuit of the greatest possible correlation with the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, the MF will reach itsmanagement objective using the indirect replication method which means that it will enter into one or more OTC swapcontracts enabling it to reach its investment objective. The objective of these swap contracts will be to exchange (i) thevalue of the MF’s assets, which will consist of balance sheet assets (excluding any securities received as guarantees),for (ii) the value of the securities that underlie the Benchmark Indicator,
The securities in the MF’s assets will notably be securities making up the Benchmark Indicator, as well as otherinternational equities, from all economic sectors, listed on all markets, including the small caps markets,
The securities basket held may be adjusted daily so that its value will be superior or equal to 100% of the Fund's netassets in most cases. Where necessary, the aim of this adjustment will be the neutralisation of the counterparty riskresulting from the future exchange contract described above,
As part of the management of its exposure, the MF can use up to 20% of its assets to acquire equities from a singleissuing entity. This 20% limit will be checked on each rebalancing date of the Benchmark Indicator, in application ofthe Benchmark Indicator’s calculation method that limits the exposure to each of equities of a single issuing entity to20%, and for which the calculation is carried out by the sponsor or the calculation agent of the Benchmark Indicator.This 20% limit can be increased to 35% for a single issuing entity when this proves to be justified by exceptionalconditions within the market, notably when certain securities are heavily dominant and/or in the event of high volatilityof a ﬁnancial instrument and of securities from an economic sector represented by the Benchmark Indicator, inparticular in the event of a public offering affecting one of the securities making up the Benchmark Indicator or in theevent of a signiﬁcant restriction of liquidity affecting one or more ﬁnancial instruments making up the BenchmarkIndicator.
2. Balance sheet assets {excluding integrated derivatives[
The MF may hold, in compliance with the ratios contained in the regulation, international equities (from all economicsectors, listed on all markets), including within the small cap markets,
The aforementioned equities will be chosen on the basis of criteria:
- of eligibility, in particular:
0 Subordination to the main market indices or to the Benchmark Indicator,
0 Liquidity (minimal thresholds applied to mean daily volumes of transactions and t0 the equity market capitalisation),0 Rating of the country of the issuer’s head office (requirement of a minimal threshold in S&P rating or equivalent),
- of diversification, notably:
o Issuer (application of ratios applicable to the eligible assets of a UCITS, as speciﬁed in Art. R214-21 of the [French]Monetaly and Financial Code),
0 Geographical area,
0 Sector.
The investment in undertakings for collective investment in transferable securities (“UCITS) compliant with the
Directive 2009/65/EC is limited to 10% of the assets of the MF. As part of these investments, the MF can subscribe to
units or equities of UCITS managed by the management company, or a company with which it is linked. The managerwill not invest in units or equities of AIF or other investment funds established on the basis of foreign laws.

When the MF receives securities as guarantee under the conditions and limits of this section’s paragraph 8 below, theywill also constitute balance sheet assets received in full ownership by the MF, given that they are received by the MF infull ownership.

As part of a future optimisation of the MF management, the manager reserves the right to use other instruments withinthe limits of the regulations, such as to achieve the management objective, for example including future financialinstruments other than index-linked swaps.
In compliance with its best execution policy, the management company considers that the Société Générale is thecounterparty that generally makes it possible to obtain the best possible result with these future ﬁnancial instruments,These future ﬁnancial instruments (including index-linked swaps) can therefore be traded with the Société Générale,without prior open competition involving several counterparties,
The counterparty 0f the aforesaid future ﬁnancial instruments (the “Counterparty”) will have no discretionary powerregarding the composition of the MF's portfolio, nor regarding the underlying assets of the future ﬁnancial instruments.
4. Securities with integrated derivativesNone.

7. Temgorag securities acguisition and sale operationsNone‘ The manager will not have recourse to temporary securities acquisition and/or sale operation,
Maw
In all cases in which the MF is subject to a counterparty risk as a result of the deployed investment strategy, notably inthe event of the MF’s use of forward swap contracts traded over the counter, the MF can receive securities that areconsidered as guarantees in order to reduce the counterparty risk related to these operations. The portfolio of receivedguarantees can be adjusted each day in order for its value to be greater than or equal to the level of the counterparty riskborne by the MF in most cases, The objective of this adjustment will be to ensure that the level of counterparty riskborne by the MF is totally neutralized,
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF will be provided to the MP in full ownership and listed in the MF’s accountopened in the books of its depositary. As such, the received ﬁnancial guarantees will be listed amongst the MF'S assets,
Any ﬁnancial guarantee received by the MF within this framework must comply with the criteria defined by theprevailing laws and regulations, notably in terms of liquidity, valuation, credit quality of the issuers, correlation, risksrelated to the management of securities, and applicability. The received guarantees must, in particular, comply with thefollowing conditions:
(a) Any received guarantee must be of high quality, very liquid and traded on a regulated market or in a multilateraltrading system with transparent pricing, in order to be sold quickly at a price close to the prior valuation;
(b) They must be valued at the mark-to-market price at least on a daily basis and assets showing strong price volatilitymust not be accepted as guarantee except in case of the application of a sufﬁciently cautious discount;
(c) They must be issued by an entity that is independent of the counterparty and must not be highly correlated with thecounterparty’s performances;
(d) They must be sufficiently diversified in terms of countries, markets and issuers, with a maximum exposure perissuer of 20% of the MF’s net asset value;
(e) The MF’s Management Company must be able to fully realise them at any time, without consultation with thecounterparty nor approval of the latter.
Notwithstanding the condition speciﬁed in (d) above, the Fund may receive a basket of financial guarantees with anexposure to a single issuer corresponding to more than 20% of its net asset value provided that:
0 such received ﬁnancial guarantees are issued by (i) a Member State, (ii) one or more of a Member State’s localauthorities, (iii) a country that is not a Member State (iv) a public international organization to which one or moreMember States belong; and

In compliance with the aforesaid conditions, the guarantees received by the MF can include:(i) Liquid assets or equivalents, notably including short-term bank assets and money market instruments;
(ii) Bonds issued or guaranteed by an OECD Member State, by its local public authorities or by institutions andsupranational bodies of a Community, regional or worldwide nature, or by any other country, provided that conditions(a) to (e) (above) have been fully met;
(iii) Equities or units issued by money market funds that calculate a daily net asset value and that have a rating of AAAor equivalent;
(iv) Equities or units issued by UCITS investing primarily in bonds/equities as indicated in points (V) and (Vi) below;(V) Bonds issued or guaranteed by ﬁrst-class issuers, offering suitable liquidity;
(Vi) Equities admitted to trading or traded on a regulated market of an EU Member State, on a stock market of an OECDMember State or on a stock market of another country provided that conditions (a) to (e) (above) have been fully metand that these equities are included within a firstvclass index‘
Policy related to discounts:
The MF’s management company will apply a margin to the financial guarantees received by the MF. The appliedmargins will notably depend on the following criteria:
- Nature of the asset received as guarantee;- Maturity of the asset received as guarantee (if applicable);- Rating of the issuer of the asset received as guarantee (if applicable).
Reinvestment of received guarantees
Financial guarantees received in a non—cash form shall not be sold, reinvested or pledged, Guarantees received in cashshall, at the discretion of the manager, be either:
(i) deposited with an enabled institution;
(ii) invested in high-quality State bonds;
(iii) used for reverse repurchase transactions, on the condition that such transactions are performed with creditinstitutions which are subject to prudential regulation and on the condition that the UCITS may at any time withdrawthe total amount of the liquidity, taking into account accrued interest;
(iv) invested in short-term money mutual funds, as they are deﬁned in the guidelines for a common definition ofEuropean money mutual funds.
Reinvested cash financial guarantees must be diversified, in compliance with the applicable requirements for non-cashﬁnancial guarantees.
Risk proﬁle:
The bearer’s money will primarily be invested in financial instruments selected by the management company. Theseinstruments will be subject to the vagaries of the markets.
Through the MF, the bearer is primarily exposed to the following risks:
- Eguity risk
An equity price can vary upward or downward, and it notably reﬂects the changing risks related to the issuing company01' the economic situation of the corresponding market. The equity markets are more volatile than the rate markets, inwhich it is possible, over a given period and with equal macroeconomic conditions, to estimate the incomes,
- Capital loss risk
The invested capital is not guaranteed. The investor consequently runs the risk of capital loss. The entire or part of theinvested amount may not be recovered, notably should the performance of the Benchmark Indicator be negative overthe investment period.
- Risk related to low diversiﬁcation of the Benchmark Indicator
The Benchmark Indicator to which the investors are exposed covers a given region, area or strategy and therefore doesnot necessarily allow for as broad a diversiﬁcation of the assets as would be the ease of an index that is exposed toseveral regions, sectors or strategies. The exposure to an index with such low diversiﬁcation can result in greatervolatility than in more diversiﬁed markets. Nevertheless, the diversiﬁcation rules resulting from the UCITS standardsalways apply to the MF’s underlyings.
- Liquidity risk {primary market!
Should the MF (or one of its counterparties for future financial instrument (“FFI”)) adjust its exposure and the marketsrelated to this exposure are then limited, closed or subject to significant purchase / sale price discrepancies, the valueand/or liquidity of the MF could be negatively affected

===================================================

LYXOR MSCI INDIA UCITS ETF

Should low volumes of exchanges result in an inability to can)! out transactions linked to the replication of theBenchmark Indicator, this can also have consequences on the processes related to the subscription, conversion orredemption of units.
- Liquidity risk on a place of listing
The MF’s share price can deviate from its indicative net asset value The liquidity ofthe MF’s units on a place oflistingcan be affected by any suspension that could notably be due to:
i) Suspension or stoppage of the calculation of the Benchmark Indicator, and/or
ii) Suspension of the market(s) 0f the underlyings used by the Benchmark Indicator, and/or
iii) The impossibility for a given place of listing to obtain or calculate the MF’s indicative net asset value, and/oriv) A market maker’s Violation of the rules applicable to this marketplace, and/or
V) A failure of this marketplace's IT or electronic systems.
mm
The MF is exposed to the risk of bankruptcy, payment default or any other type of default of every counterparty withwhich it has entered into a contract or transaction. It is particularly exposed to the counterparty risk resulting from itsuse of FFI traded over-the-counter with Societe Générale or with any other counterparty. In compliance with the UCITSregulations, the counterparty risk (whether this counterparty is the Societe Generale or any other entity) cannot exceed10% of the total value of the MF‘s assets per counterparty.
In case of a Counterparty’s default, the contract relating to FFIs can be terminated early. The MF will then make everyeffort to achieve its management objective by signing, if relevant, another contract relating to FFIs with a third partycounterparty, under the market conditions prevailing at the time of the occurrence of this event.
The realisation of this risk can notably have impacts on the MF’s ability to achieve its management objective, inparticular the replication of the Benchmark Indicator.
When Société Générale is involved as a counterparty 0f the FFIs, conﬂicts of interest can arise between the MF’sManagement Company and the FFI‘s counterparty. The Management Company manages these conﬂict of interest risksby setting up procedures intended to identify and limit them, and to ensure their equitable resolution, if relevant.
W
The MF’s exposure to emerging markets results in a greater risk of loss that would exist in the event of investmentscarried out within traditional developed markets‘ In particular, the operating and supervision rules in an emergingmarket may differ from the standards applicable to developed markets. The exposure to emerging markets notablyresults in: increased volatility of the markets, lower transaction volumes, the risk of economic and/or politicalinstability, an unstable or uncertain ﬁscal and/or regulatory regime, risks of closing of the markets, of governmentrestrictions on foreign investments, and interruption or restriction of the convertibility 0r transferability of any of thecurrencies comprising the Benchmark Indicator.
- Risk that the management objective may only be partially achieved
Nothing guarantees that the management objective will be achieved. Indeed, n0 asset or financial instrument will allowan automatic and continuous replication of the Benchmark Indicator, notably should one or more of the following risksarise:
- Ris related to the use of derivative instruments

In order to achieve its investment objective, the MF uses FFI traded over-the-counter, that can notably take the form ofswap contracts that will allow it to obtain the performance of the Benchmark Indicator, These FFIs can result in a seriesof risks on the level of the FFIs that notably include: counterparty risk, event affecting the hedging, event affecting theBenc mark Indicator, risk related to the tax regime, risk related to the regulations, operational risk and liquidity risk,These risks can directly affect a FFI and can result in the adjustment or early termination of the FFI transaction, whichcoulc affect the MF'S net asset value.
- Ris related to a change of the tax regime
Any change to the tax legislation in any of the countries in which the MF is established, authorised for marketing orlisted can affect the tax treatment of the investors. In this case, the MF’S manager assumes no liability relative toinvestors with regard to the payments having to be made to any competent tax authority.
- Ris related to a change of the tax regime affecting the underlying

Any change of the tax legislation applicable to the MF’s underlyings can affect the MF‘s tax treatment. Consequently,in case of divergence between the anticipated tax treatment and the one actually applied to the MF (and/or to itscounterparty in the FFI), the MF’s net asset value may be affected.
- Ris related to regulations
In case of change of the regulations in any country in which the MP is established, authorised for marketing or listed,the processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units may be affected

- Risk related to the regulations agplicable t0 the underlyings

In case of change of the regulations applicable to the MF’s underlyings, the MF’s net asset value can be affected, as canthe processes for the subscription, conversion and redemption of the units.
- Risk related to events affecting the Benchmark Indicator

In case of events affecting the Benchmark Indicator, the manager may, under the conditions and limits of the applicablelegislation, have to suspend the subscription and redemption of MF units. The calculation of the MF’s net asset valuecan also be affected.
If the event persists, the MF's manager will decide on measures having to be adopted, which can have an impact on theMF’s net asset value.
“Events affecting the Benchmark Indicator” are understood to mean the following situations:i) The Benchmark Indicator is considered to be incorrect or not reﬂective of the market’s actual evolution,ii) The Benchmark Indicator is definitively discontinued by the supplier of the index,
iii) The supplier of the Benchmark Indicator is incapable of providing the level or value of the said BenchmarkIndicator,
iv) The supplier of the index makes a signiﬁcant change to the formula or calculation method of the BenchmarkIndicator (other than a minor modiﬁcation such as the adjustment of the underlyings used with this BenchmarkIndicator or of the respective weightings between its various components), that cannot be effectively replicated by theMF at a reasonable cost,
v) One or more components of the Benchmark Indicator becomes non-liquid, with the listing being suspended on anorganised market, or components traded over-the-counter (such as bonds, for example) become non-liquid.
- Securities transaction risk
Should the issuer of a security underlying the Benchmark Indicator undertake an unanticipated review of a securitiestransaction (“ST”), that contradicts a prior and ofﬁcial announcement that had resulted in a valuation of the ST by theMF (and/or in a valuation of the ST by the MF’s counterparty in a future ﬁnancial instrument), the MF’s net asset valuemay be affected, notably should the actual treatment of the ST by the MF differ from the ST’s treatment in themethodology used by the Benchmark Indicator.
— Exchange risk linked to the class of units C- (EUR/USD)
The abovementioned class of units is exposed to an exchange risk to the extent that it is listed in a currency other thanthat of the Benchmark Indicators The net asset value of the abovementioned class of units can therefore decrease due toﬂuctuating exchange rates even though the value of the Benchmark Indicator has increased,
— Exchange risk linked to the Benchmark Indicator

The MF is exposed to the exchange risk insofar as the underlying securities making up the Benchmark Indicator may belisted in a currency other than the currency of the Benchmark Indicator or be derived from securities listed in a currencyother than the currency of the Benchmark Indicator, The ﬂuctuations of exchange rates could therefore negatively affectthe Benchmark Indicator followed by the MF.
- Legal risk
The mutual fund may bear a legal risk related to the conclusion of any Total Return Swap contract (TRS) as laid downin Regulation (EU) 2015/2365.
Subscribers concerned and typical investor proﬁle:The MF is “open to any subscriber”.An investor subscribing to this MF wishes to obtain an exposure to the Indian equities market.
The amount that it is reasonable to invest in this MF depends on your personal situation. To determine this amount, youmust take into account your personal wealth and/or estate, cash requirements at the present and for five years, but alsoyour desire to take risks or, on the contrary, to prefer a cautious investment. It is also highly recommended tosufﬁciently diversify one’s investments so as to avoid an exposure only to this MF’s risks.
Investors are therefore recommended to study their individual situations with their usual estate management advisers,The minimum recommended investment term is greater than 5 years.
Indications on the tax treatment:
Investors should take note that the following information constitutes only a general summary of the tax regimeapplicable to an investment in a French MF, under the current French tax legislation, Investors are therefore requestedto study their personal situations with their usual tax advisers,

Abroad (in countries in which the MF is invested), capital gains on the sale of foreign transferable securities and foreignincome received by the MF as part of its management may, if relevant, be subject to tax (generally in the form of awithholding tax). In certain limited cases, the foreign taxation can be reduced or cancelled in the presence of taxagreements that may be applicable.

France and the United States have signed a Model I intergovernmental agreement (“IGA”) for the implementation inFrance 0f the American law known as the “FATCA” law that targets tax evasion amongst American taxpayers holdingﬁnancial assets abroad. The expression “American taxpayers refers to a natural person who is an American citizen orresident, a partnership or company created in the United States or by virtue of American federal law or of the laws ofone of the American States, or a trust if (i) a court located in the United States has, pursuant to the law, the power toissue orders or decisions substantially relating to all questions relative to the trust’s administration and if (ii) one ormore American taxpayers has a right of control over all of the trust’s substantial decisions, or over the estate of adeceased person who was a citizen or resident of the United States.
