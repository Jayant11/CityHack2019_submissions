EVENTS OCCURRING AFTER BALANCE SHEET DATE
There are no significant events occurring after the balance sheet date.
STANDARDS ISSUED BUT NOT YET EFFECTIVE
Below are the mandatory standards, amendments and interpretations to existing standards thathave been published, and are relevant for the Group’s accounting periods beginning after1january2018 or later periods and which the Group has not early adopted:
(i)
IFRS 9, Financial instruments
The Group is adopting the new standard 0n1January 2018 and comparative information willnot be restated.
In July 2014, the International Accounting Standards Board issued the final version ofIFRS 9 Financial Instruments that replaces IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition andMeasurement and all previous versions of IFRS 9. IFRS 9 brings together all three aspects ofthe accounting for financial instruments project: classification and measurement, impairmentand hedge accounting. IFRS 9 is effective for annual periods beginning on or after1january2018, with early application permitted. Except for hedge accounting, retrospective applicationis required but providing comparative information is not compulsory. For hedge accounting,the requirements are generally applied prospectively, with some limited exceptions.
During 2017, the Group has performed a detailed impact assessment ofall three aspects ofIFRS 9. This assessment is based on currently available information and may be subject tochanges arising from further reasonable and supportable information being made availableto the Group in 2018 when the Grou adopts IFRS 9. In addition, the Group will implementchanges in classification of certain inancial instruments. Overall, the Group expects nosignificant impact on its statement of financial position and equity except for the effect ofmeasuring debt securities currently held as loans and receivables and fair value throughprofit and loss.
(a) Classification and measurement
The Group does not expect a significant impact on its balance sheet or equity onapplying the classification and measurement requirements of IFRS 9 with effect 1January 2018. It expects to continue measuring at fair value all financial assets currentlyheld at fair value. Quoted equity shares and debt securities currently held as AFS withgains and losses recorded in other comprehensive income will, instead, be measuredat fair value through profit or loss, which will increase volatility in recorded profit orloss. On 1 January 2018, the AFS reserve of $357.63 million related to those securities inamount, which is currently presented as accumulated other comprehensive income,will be reclassified to opening retained earnings.
Debt securities currently held as loans and receivables will be measured at fairvalue through profit and loss after analysing the intention of holding them andtheir contractual cashflow characteristics. On 1 January 2018, the Group expects anincrease in net asset value ofapproximately S$1.6O million from fair value adjustmentsof such securities. The opening retained earnings will correspondingly increase byapproximately S$1.60 million.
In total, the opening retained earnings will increase by approximately S$9.23 millionon 1 January 2018 following the above adjustments.
(b) Impairment
IFRS 9 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loansand receivables, either on a 12-month or lifetime basis. Following the classification oftheloans and receivables to fair value through profit and loss, the Group does not expectany material impairment adjustments arising from the adoption from this standard.

INVESTMENT DESCRIPTION
GIL has invested in a portfolio of securitised assets, comprising Collateralised Loan Obligation (CLO)notes, Residential Mortgage-Backed Securities (RMBS) and Credit Card Asset-Backed Securities(ABS). The CLO notes, denominated in USD and EUR, are issued by securitisation vehicles that holdcollateral consisting of mainly senior secured corporate debt. The other securitised assets are issuedby securitisation vehicles that hold Australian residential mortgage loans and credit card receivablesrespectively.
ASSET OVE RVI EW
In 2017, GIL added new positions in Latitude Series 2017-1, Resimac Bastille Trust Series 2017-1NC andLiberty Series 2017-4 notes, with a total face value of A$3.50 million. During the same period, therewere also redemptions of the Liberty Series 2013-2 Class E note and multiple other CLO notes.
As at 31 December 2017, the Company’s carrying value1 was US$16.20 million for the USD-denominatedCLO portfolio and €2.81 million for the Euro-denominated CLO portfolio. The carrying value for the ABSportfolio was A$4.08 million.
OUTLOOK
2017 was one of the strongest years for new issuance of CLOs as US$141.5 billion of global supply
hit the market. Strong investor demand drove spreads tighter across senior and mezzanine tranchesfor both US and EUR CLOs. Improving macroeconomic conditions and the continued hunt for yieldalong with investor preference for floating rate notes in a rising-rate environment will likely continueto compress spreads for this asset class in 2018. Moody‘s Global Speculative-Grade Corporate DefaultRate ended 2017 at 2.9%, down from 4.4% at the end of 2016. For 2018, Moody's expects the defaultrate to continue its downward path and to close the year under 2%, citing the pick-up in globaleconomic momentum, Iow refinancing risk, and healthy corporate liquidity profiles.
The price of the Palmer Square CLO Debt Index, a total return index which tracks the value of USmezzanine CLO debt tranches, gained 9.1% in USD terms in 2017.

OUTLOOK
In the US, with growth momentum carrying over into 2018, aided in part by the passage of a taxreform bill at the end of 2017, the Fed has signalled a continuation of its programme of interest ratenormalisation through interest rate hikes and balance sheet reduction. A similarly positive outlook forthe economy has also given the ECB reason to begin tapering its QE through halving the amount in itsasset purchase programme. Other key macro events that may impact European credit markets includethe 2018 Italian elections and the ongoing Brexit negotiations. More central banks around the worldcan be expected tojoin the normalisation bandwagon, ifinflation picks up. However, solid operatingperformance should still be supportive of credit fundamentals although investors will be watching forreleveraging of corporate balance sheets in advance of rising interest rates.
TheJP Morgan Asia Credit Index, which tracks the Asian bond markets, gained 5.8% in USD terms in2017. TheJP Morgan US Liquid Index, which tracks the investment grade dollar denominated corporatebond market, gained 6.4% in USD terms in the same period.

OUTLOOK
A progressive rising rates macro environment for banks is expected to further improve bank earningfundamentals after the successful recapitalization and de—risking efforts of banks in 2017. The Basel|V regulations announced in 4Q17 further reduced regulatory risk for the COCO market in the mediumterm while laying the groundwork for ongoing regulatory capital build in order to meet the newrequirements, supporting a progressive outlook for bank credit fundamentals.
The unwinding of central banks’ balance sheets and the subsequent impact on spreads alongsideuncertainty over political events in the near term are important headwinds for investors to considerin 2018.

INVESTMENT DESCRIPTION
GIL has invested in a portfolio of listed equities with a carrying value of S$38.14 million as at 31December 2017. The cumulative fair value gain was $13.61 million.
ASS ET OVE RVI EW
As at 31 December 2017, the equity portfolio had the highest exposure to Hong Kong listed equities at65.9%, followed by Singapore listed equities at 20.2%. The rest of the other markets all had exposures
under 5%. In terms of sector distribution, the highest weighting was in finance-related equities (18.7%),followed by oil & gas (17.3%) and utilities (14.5 %) equities.
OUTLOOK
The current global economic momentum provides a positive backdrop for equity markets, with
strong operating performance and improving profitability of companies that could get support fromfactors such as the recently approved US tax policy reforms, the technology sector continuing its goodperformance and a stabilisation in the commodities sector. However, markets are starting from a highafter the strong performance in 2017, with historically high valuations and low volatility. Any deviationthat could derail the positive growth picture, be it in the form of increased inflationary pressure withconcomitant central bank action, geopolitical tension or a tit—for-tat trade or currency dispute, couldlead to bouts of heightened volatility and downward movements in the equity markets.

The International Monetary Fund revised its projection for global economic growth for 2018 upwardsby 0.2% to 3.9% in the updated forecast released in January 2018. in view ofthe increased globalgrowth momentum and the expected positive impact from the approved US tax policy changes.However. expensive asset valuations and very tight term premiums raised the possibility of a marketcorrection, which could hamper continued confidence in the financial markets. Downside risk couldtrigger from higher than expected core inflation within the developed economies and ensuing higherinterest rates.
There was also a further rebound in energy prices, as Brent crude prices climbed from $56 at the startof 201 7 to end the year at $67, which was supported by aforementioned improved global economicconditions, disruptions from weather events in the US, extension of the OPEC agreement andgeopolitical tensions in the Middle East. Other hard commodities, in particular industrial metals, alsosaw a strong performance in the year; on the other hand. it was a mixed year for soft commodities.

Meanwhile, core inflation decreasedwith the core Personal Consumption Expenditures (PCE) index coming in at 1.5% year-on-year (y-o-y)in December 2017, compared to 1.9% y-o-y in the previous year. In view of the continued economicoutperformance and strength in the labour market, Fed raised the Fed Funds Rate three times, onceeach in March,june and December 2017, by a total of 75 basis points. The Fed has projected threefurther rate hikes in 2018 while maintaining its inflation target of 2.0% as it expects global economicdevelopments to warrant the projected increases in the federal funds rate.
Growth accelerated in the Eurozone with GDP increasing by 2.6%2 in 2017 compared to 1.8% in 2016,supported by strong employment numbers and private sector confidence.

Eurozone inflation, measured by the Harmonised Indexof Consumer Price increased to 1.4% y-o-y in 2017, from 1.1% y-o-y in 2016. The ECB made no changeto its policy rates as core inflation remained below the ECB’s target of 2%, while extending its assetpurchase programme to September 2018, which indicated that the ECB decided to remain patient andpersistent in maintaining an easy policy stance despite a positive economic backdrop. However, theECB also announced that it will be gradually reducing the pace of asset purchase by halving monthlyasset purchases from €60 billion to €30 billion from January 2018 onwards.

For FY2017, the NGC conducted a seIf—review against the responsibilities set out in the Nomination andGovernance Committee Charter and concluded that the NGC had adequately fulfilled its duties.
Review of Independence
The NGC coordinates the assessment of the performance of the Board as a whole, the Boardcommittees, the Chairman ofthe Board and the Board’s individual directors and determines annually ifa director should be considered independent. The independence of any director who has served on theBoard beyond nine years from the date of his first appointment will be rigorously reviewed (Guideline2.4 of the Singapore Code). The NGC shall provide its views to the Board when the NGC considers that adirector:
1. Can still be deemed as independent despite the existence of relationships and circumstancesenumerated in guidelines 2.3 and 2.4 of the Singapore Code.
2. Is not independent even in the absence of relationships and circumstances enumerated inguidelines 2.3 and 2.4 of the Singapore Code.

GIL will compensate the Manager for providing the above services as set out in the terms oftheManagement Agreement through the Manager Fee structure as disclosed under Principle 8.
No immediate family members of the directors ofthe Board are employed by GIL or the Manager.ACCOUNTABILITY, AUDIT AND RISK MANAGEMENT
As part of the Corporate Governance Framework, the following principles apply on accountability andaudit:
Principle 10: Accountability of the Board of Directors and Management
The Board seeks to provide the shareholders with a balanced and understandable assessment ofGIL’sperformance, position and prospects through its announcement of quarterly and full year financialresults (quarterly financial results are released within 45 days afterthe end of each quarter while fullyear financial results are released within 60 days after the financial year end), dividend guidance andother material information via SGXNet and GIL’s corporate website. Annual reports are sent to allshareholders and are accessible on GIL’s website. The Manager provides the Board with information toenable the Board to make a balanced and informed assessment ofCompany's performance, positionand prospects. The Manager also submits a quarterly compliance checklist to the SGX-ST confirmingthat all the financial results announced via SGXNet comply with the requirements set out in the ListingManual.
The Board has formal policies and procedures on reporting and review of financial information. Thereare also policies and procedures established to ensure compliance with legislative and regulatoryrequirements. The Board has access to monthly management accounts and is provided with suchexplanation and information as the Board may require from time to time.
Principle11: Risk Management Committee and Internal ControlsRisk Management
The Board is responsible for the governance of risk. The Board determines GIL’s level of risk toleranceand risk policies and oversees the Manager in the design, implementation and monitoring of the riskmanagement and internal control systems.
GIL has implemented an Enterprise Risk Management (ERM) Framework for the identification of
key risks within the business. This Framework defines five major classifications of risks - Strategic,Investment/Economic, Regulatory, Financial and Operational. Operational risks include possible lapsesin internal controls and risks from external events such as legal risks as well as environmental risks.Investment/Economic risks are influenced by a variety of general economic and business conditions inthe places where GIL has investments or where GIL’s underlying assets and economic exposures arelocated. Such factors may affect the share price of GIL and its ability to meet dividend expectations.While appropriate risk mitigation measures within GIL’s risk assessment framework are taken toaddress such inherent risk, the Board notes that, as elaborated upon below, no system of internalcontrols and risk management can eliminate all risks.
GIL adopts the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway Commission Model and theInternational Organization for Standardization on Risk Management (ISO 31000:2009(E)) guidelinesfor assessing the soundness ofits financial reporting, and the efficiency and effectiveness ofits riskmanagement, internal control and compliance systems.
The ARMC assists the Board in the oversight of risk management in GIL. It reviews the effectivenessof the overall risk management system in meeting sound corporate governance principles. GIL’s risk

management process is an ongoing process and requires the continuous identification, assessment,monitoring and management of significant risks. The ARMC will report any material matters, includingfindings and recommendations pertaining to risk management to the Board.
The Manager is responsible for reporting the status of any key risk exposures or incidents to the ARMC.The Risk Register and Risk Profiles are reviewed on a quarterly basis. Key risks at the process level willbe identified via risk self—assessment exercises. Risk awareness and ownership of risk treatments arealso continuously fostered across the Manager’s organisation.
The Board reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of the company's risk management and internalcontrol systems, including financial, operational, compliance and information technology controls on anannual basis.
Internal Controls
GIL does not have any employees and in this externally managed model, it relies on the Manager toestablish, implement and maintain a sound system ofinternal controls to safeguard shareholders’investments and GIL’s assets and to report to the ARMC on the adequacy and effectiveness of
these systems ofinternal controls and risk management on a regular basis. The ARMC reviews theeffectiveness of the system of internal controls at least annually. In its letter of representation to GIL,the Manager has confirmed that it has established an adequate system of internal controls, addressingfinancial, operational, compliance and information technology controls of GIL.
Based on the work done and the reviews undertaken by the external auditors and the Manager’sinternal auditor, the Board (with the concurrence of the ARMC) is of the opinion that there are adequateand effective risk management systems as well as internal controls in place to help to mitigate criticaland significant risks relating to financial, operational, compliance and information technology matters.The system ofinternal controls and risk management framework established by the Manager providereasonable, but not absolute, assurance that GIL’s assets and investments are safeguarded. Thelikelihood of achieving the objectives of the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the TreadwayCommission Model is affected by limitations inherent in all internal control and risk managementsystems. The Board notes that no system of internal controls and risk management can provideabsolute assurance in this regard, or absolute assurance against the occurrence of material errors, poorjudgment in decision-making, human error, losses, fraud or other irregularities.
Principle 12: Audit Committee
While GIL does not have a CEO/CFO, for FY2017, the Manager has provided written assurance to
the Board confirming that GIL’s financial records have been properly maintained and the financialstatements give a true and fair view of GIL’s operations. This certification also confirms the adequacy ofGIL’s risk management, compliance and internal control systems.

OVERVIEW
CHAIRMAN'S SIAI




*Nl [cont'd]
The VIX index remained in a tight range during2017 and in the latter half of the year, oftenreaching levels that were lower than a decadeago. This took place amidst a steady climb byequity and fixed income markets through theyear, supported by the confluence ofa benigninflation backdrop and a synchronised economicupswing that both accelerated and broadenedacross the globe. This provided a Goldilocksenvironment for almost all asset classes to poststrong positive returns in 2017.
As the year began, the inauguration of PresidentDonald Trump in the US created some challengesfor investors trying to assess the impact hispolicies on issues such as trade and energy mayhave on the global economic agenda. The impassebetween both chambers of the US Congress toreach an agreement on a replacement for theAffordable Care Act also led some to questionwhether Trump could overcome the divisions
in the Republican Party. However, despitedistractions throughout the year such as ongoinginvestigations into external influence on the
2016 US elections and the political sabre—rattlingbetween the US and North Korea, the year
closed out on a high note for Trump as Congressapproved substantive tax cuts that were projectedto give a boost to the US economy. As expected,the Federal Reserve (Fed) lifted its benchmarkinterest rate three times in 2017. Perhaps moreimportantly,Jerome Powell was nominated totake overJanet Yellen as the Fed Chairman, achange widely anticipated to provide continuity onthe current Fed’s monetary policy, at least in theshort term.
In Europe, political risk faded into the backgroundas election results in Germany and France came inlargely within expectations. This helped improvebusiness sentiment and boost corporate earnings,to the extent that encouraged by the returninghealth of the European economy, the EuropeanCentral Bank (ECB) announced in October thatthey would be dialling their QE programme downa notch by reducing the amount of monthly assetpurchases. Around the same time however, thepotential breakaway of the rich Catalonian regionin Spain weighed somewhat on the economic andmarket performance of the euro zone’s fourth-largest economy, a political development thatshould remain on investors’ watchlist for 2018.
A GLOBALINVESTMENTS LIMITED
Overall, Asia and emerging markets put in thebest performance for the year. Several factorscontributed to this: a weak USD, which hashistorically been supportive of the relativestrength of emerging market equities, a strongrebound in the technology sector and recoveringcommodity prices which fed into the strongperformance of the export oriented economies,and a steady but still substantial GDP growth byAsian powerhouse China, which continued tofocus on structural reforms and reducingfinancial risks.
INVESTMENT OUTLOOK FOR 2018
2018 is likely to see a continuation of the globaleconomic expansion, led by the US and China,with Europe emerging as a growth engine for thefirst time this cycle. Labour markets are expectedto remain in the pink of health, asjoblessnessand underemployment carry on their trenddownwards globally. With sustained tightening oflabour markets, if wage inflation were to suddenlyzoom up, this, together with higher commodityprices, could raise 2018’s inflation outlook. Suchan outcome may force central banks to normalizemonetary policy faster than expected, especiallythose that have been behind the curve. In aclimate in which investors have been questioningwhether valuations of some markets appearoverextended relative to history, a fundamentallyexcessive and/or overzealous pace of interest rateincreases poses a threat to the rosy outlook forfinancial markets, which could spill over to thereal economy.
The passage of US tax reforms in late 2017 is
set to further advance corporate profit marginexpansion in 2018, giving a mild boost to theeconomy. While the new tax rules increaseearnings growth and is supportive of a continuedclimb by the equity markets, the tax cuts alsocome with a reduction in interest expensedeductibility. Depending on the capital structureof a company, the impact of this could range fromvery little to a lot. Investors would be well servedto examine the impact on cash ﬂows, especiallyhigh yield corporates in economic downturnscenarios. 2018 Fed watching is also interesting tosay the least. Three rate hikes have been pencilledin for the year. Whether the Fed will stick to thescript is not only dependent on the new Fed Chairbut also who eventually fills the three vacancieson the Fed Board of Governors, the body thatvotes on US monetary policy.

ENVIRONMENTAL SUSTAINABILITY7. PROMOTING A SUSTAINABLE ENVIRONMENT
Given that GIL currently does not employ any staff, we encourage the staff of our Manager to be
an integral part of its efforts to be eco-friendly. While our business does not rely heavily on naturalresources, we continue to undertake initiatives to reduce its environmental footprint throughconservation of energy and proper management of paper and electronic waste by setting environmentalconsen/ation targets for our Manager.
CONSERVATION OF ELECTRICITY
Our Manager adopts several practices to contribute to environmental conservation in daily operations.For example, they make use of LED and high fluorescent fixtures which are proven to be more energy—efficient. Using LEDs instead of incandescent light bulbs can save approximately 75% on electricity usage.Not only does this aid in conservation efforts, it is also more cost-efﬁcient.
In addition, the Manager’s staff consistently make sure lights, air conditioners and other electronicappliances are always switched off when not in use. The Company also supports the fight against climatechange by observing “Earth Hour.
DISPOSAL OF HARDWARE AND PAPER
Improper disposal of electronic devices can lead to many harmful effects on the environment. Properdisposal of hardware reduces the amount of electronic waste accumulated at landfill sites andreduces the amount of raw materials needed to build new devices. Hence, the Manager ensures thatall decommissioned phones, desktops and notebooks are sold to recycling vendors who either resell,salvage reusable parts or dispose of them appropriately.
It has become common knowledge that excess usage of paper is responsible for massive deforestationand global warming. Therefore, it is important to reduce paper wastage and dispose of it carefully.
The Manager’s printers are always set for doubIe-sided printing and we closely monitor the monthlyconsumption of paper-related waste products. The Manager also encourages staff to avoid printing hardcopies of their documents.

The course equipped the staff with knowledge about standardprocedures in case of an emergency. The Manager’s staff who completed the training received aCPR+AED Certificate upon completion of the course.
CAREGIVERS -T0-CAREGIVERS EDUCATION PROGRAM
Findings from Singapore Mental Health Study conducted by the Institute of Mental Health in 2010revealed that the most common mental disorders are Major Depressive Disorder (1 in 17), AlcoholAbuse (1 in 32) and Obsessive Compulsive Disorder (1 in 33). Most mental disorders occur by the ageof 29 and most people with mental illness do not seek help. This study indicates that there is a needfor the community to reach out to the large number of caregivers who need support in caring for theirloved one.
With this in mind, the Manager has engaged Caregivers Alliance Limited (CAL), a non-profit organisationin Singapore dedicated to meeting the needs of families and caregivers of people with mental illness toprovide an eight—session Caregivers-to-Caregivers Education Program to the staff.
This program provided the Manager’s employees with the knowledge and skills to support and effectivelyinteract with friends, family or colleagues who are suffering from mental illness. During the 8 weeks’training, employees had the opportunity to share the issues and challenges faced when acting ascaregivers. The speaker gave useful advice about methods that can be used during the recoveryjourneyof their loved one. The Caregiver course encouraged empathy and better understanding of those who aresuffering from mental illnesses.

GIL firmly believes that human capital is critical in ensuring the Iong-term sustainability oftheCompany. Amidst the rapidIy-evolving economic landscape and stakeholder expectations, we recognisethat it can only remain relevant through the efforts and talents of a skilled and adaptable workforceand prudent selection of its manager. Given that GIL does not have any employees, it is very importantthat our Manager has a proper talent management and employee retention strategy to ensuresustainable growth.
The fundamental focus of the Manager is to make sure that each employee remains healthy and engagedin a safe work environment. The Manager’s employees should not be exposed to any high-risk activitiesin their daily operations. The Manager will encourage the staff to lead a healthy lifestyle by incorporatingexercise and a healthy diet. In addition to this, the Manager could provide staff with the option to havestanding desks to avoid them sitting for long hours.
12. TRAINING AND EDUCATION
Regular staff training and development remain key priorities for the Manager in order to make certainthat the Company keeps a diverse pool of retained talent. In order to remain relevant with the changingtimes, the Manager's staff attended a course on Business Writing Essentials conducted by the BritishCouncil. The staff learnt about modern standards of writing and how to effectively communicate withinternal and external parties. This helps to improve relationships within the workplace as well as withGIL’s business partners.

REVENUE
Revenue for the current year was S$46.7 million, 33.0% higher than the S$35.1 million recorded last year.The higher revenue was mainly contributed by higher gain on sale of investments of S$25.8 million ascompared to S$14.9 million last year.

OVERVIEW
CHAIRMAN'S SIAI




*Nl [cont'd]
these new central bankers could be the source ofvolatility depending on how hawkish their stanceon monetary policy is.
With the economic expansion taking a firmer
hold across Europe, it is important to note thatthere are still Iaggard economies that have yet
to recover to pre—crisis levels. Inflation continuesto be below 2% and is projected to remain so
until 2020. Thus, although the ECB scaled back itsasset purchase programme in October 2017, itmaintains a cautious stance on monetary policy.And while political risks are currently muted, itcan take centre stage again when Italy goes toelections in March and Spain deals with a restiveCatalonian region emboldened by the triumph ofpro-independence parties in the regional electionsin late 2017. Finally, the completion of phase oneof the Brexit negotiations in December supportsthe market’s assumption that a transitional dealnow looks more likely than it did at the start of theyear, although many challenges remain.
2018 is also a year to watch Bank ofjapan’smonetary policy and whether Kuroda continuesas its Governor after his current term ends inApril. Recent data prints inJapan have offeredsigns that wage growth and inflation are aboutto experience meaningful acceleration. Theramifications of this for monetary policy in Japanand beyond could be significant.
At the 19th Chinese Communist Party Congressin October 2017, it was noteworthy that a hardgrowth target was dropped from the official PartyCongress statement. By targeting a lower growthrate for the economy, this would help to curb
the pressure to keep pushing up credit-financedgrowth and thus leverage. In addition, a lowergrowth target allows more room for structuraladjustments, such as SOE reforms, overcapacityreduction, improving fiscal management,environmental protection, etc. To further reducerisks in the financial sector, the government hasalso moved to shift the composition of growthaway from the riskier types of credit in theshadow banking system towards more officialbank lending that can be better monitored andcontrolled. China has already made good progressin rebalancing its economy away from exports andinvestment towards consumption and services.This shift towards achieving broader-basedgrowth, rather than the highest possible level ofgrowth, can be expected to continue, alongsidefurther economic and structural reforms. With
the many planned changes to improve the qualityof modern China's development, to ensure thatthe reform momentum and implementationcontinues under steady stewardship, the
Chinese government amended its Constitution
in early March such that it could accommodate apresidency beyond the current two term limit.
While the outlook for the global economy isgenerally positive in the near term, investors haveto contend with investing in financial markets thathave enjoyed a spectacular run, with low volatilityand valuations at historical highs. They would alsohave to consider carefully how investments wouldfare in economies increasingly beset by the twinstructural issues of aging demographics and rapidtechnological changes that have the potential
to transform drastically how we live, work andplay. Already as 2018 progressed, the VIX indexhas been climbing up from the very low levels oflast year, with a briefsharp spike to above 50inearly February, levels last seen during the GlobalFinancial Crisis of 2007-2008. Investor sentimentalso took a hit when US President Trump fired
the first salvo with the announcements of
tariffs on steel and aluminium imports into US
in March. Erratic moves in the VIX index for therest of the year cannot be ruled out, with a risk
of further spikes that could arise from anythingfrom surprise central bank moves, mismanageddeleveraging, protracted tit-for-tat trade orcurrency disputes to geopolitical turbulence.Selecting investments that offer the appropriatelevel of return for the risk involved in suchcircumstances has never been more challenging.The Company believes that an enhanced focus
on security selection, including those that cantake advantage of emerging socioeconomictrends, would perhaps be a prudent approach.Regardless, it would be wise to consider includingalternatives that could provide some downsideprotection in periods of market volatility in theportfolio.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
IN DEPEN DENT AU DITOR'S REPORT
To the Shareholders of Global Investments Limited




Report on the Audit of the Consolidated Financial StatementsOpinion
We have audited the financial statements ofGlobal Investments Limited (the Company) and its subsidiaries(the Group), which comprise the consolidated statement of financial position of the Group and thestatement of financial position ofthe Company as at 31 December 2017, and the consolidated statementof comprehensive income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and consolidated statement ofcash flows of the Group for the year then ended, and notes to the financial statements, including asummary of significant accounting policies.
In our opinion, the accompanying consolidated financial statements of the Group and the statementof financial position of the Company presents fairly, in all material respects the consolidated financialposition of the Group and the financial position of the Company as at 31 December 2017 and theconsolidated financial performance and consolidated cash flows ofthe Group for the year then ended inaccordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSS).
Basis for Opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (ISAs). Our responsibilitiesunder those standards are further described in the Auditor’s Responsibilities for the Audit ofthe FinancialStatements section ofour report. We are independent ofthe Group in accordance with the Accounting andCorporate Regulatory Authority (ACRA) Code of Professional Conduct and Ethics for Public Accountantsand Accounting Entities (ACRA Code) together with the ethical requirements that are relevant to ouraudit of the financial statements in Singapore, and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities inaccordance with these requirements and the ACRA Code. We believe that the audit evidence we haveobtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion.
Key Audit Matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most significance inour audit of the financial statements of the current period. These matters were addressed in the contextof our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, and we do notprovide a separate opinion on these matters. For each matter below, our description of how our auditaddressed the matter is provided in that context.
We have fulfilled our responsibilities described in the Auditor’s responsibilities for the audit of thefinancial statements section of our report, including in relation to these matters. Accordingly, our auditincluded the performance of procedures designed to respond to our assessment of the risks of materialmisstatement ofthe financial statements. The results ofour audit procedures, including the proceduresperformed to address the matters below, provide the basis for our audit opinion on the accompanyingfinancial statements.
Carrying Value of Financial Instruments
As at 31 December 2017, the Group has investments in loans and receivables which are carried atamortised cost amounting to S$35.57 million, availabIe-for-sale financial assets which are carried atfair value amounting to 539147.32 million and financial assets held at fairvalue through profit and lossamounting to $3958.97 million. These investments have a total carrying value of S$241 .85 million, whichrepresents 71.70% of the Group’s total assets.
(1) Financial instruments not quoted in an active market
The valuation for financial assets carried at fair value uses inputs which have been classified usingthe fair value hierarchy are disclosed in Note 4(G) t0 the financial statements. As at 31 December2017, availabIe-for-sale financial assets with cost of investment of S$0.93 million were fair valuedbased on inputs that are not observable, i.e. Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy, which involve ahigher degree of management’s subjectivity and judgement.

===================================================

IN DEPEN DENT AU DITOR'S REPORT [cont'd]




Our audit of the fair valuation of Level 3 investments included assessment of the key internalcontrols over the investment valuation process, verification of prices using external sourcesand evaluation third party valuation reports. In addition, we involved our own internal valuationspecialists to evaluate the appropriateness of the valuation models, the inputs to the model andthe reasonableness of assumptions used. We further considered the adequacy of the relateddisclosures in the financial statements. The Group’s disclosures related to fair value of Level 3investments are included in Note 4(6).
(2) Impairment of financial instruments at amortised cost
Impairment assessment of financial instruments carried at amortised cost is inherently subjectivedue tojudgement involved in determining whether there’s indication of impairment and estimationof uncertainty when determining the recoverable amount if there are indicators of impairment.As such, we considered fair valuation of Level 3 financial instruments and impairment of financialinstruments carried at amortised cost to be a key audit matter.
As disclosed in Note 12 to the financial statements, there is currently no active market for financialinstruments carried at amortised cost. Accordingly, management relies on information such as collateralperformance and cash flows ofunderlying portfolio when determining recoverable amount. We assessedthe impairment testing performed by the Group, including evaluating the appropriateness of valuationmodels, inputs and key assumptions used in determining the recoverable amount and corroboratingthese inputs against external sources of evidence. We also evaluated the adequacy of the relateddisclosures in the financial statements. The Group’s disclosures related to impairment of investmentscarried at amortised cost are included in Note 7 and Note 12.
Other Information
Management is responsible for the other information. The other information comprises the informationincluded in the Annual Report, but does not include the financial statements and our auditor’s reportthereon.
Our opinion on the financial statements does not cover the other information and we do not express anyform of assurance conclusion thereon.
In connection with our audit of the financial statements, our responsibility is to read the other informationand, in doing so, consider whether the other information is materially inconsistent with the financialstatements or our knowledge obtained in the audit or otherwise appears to be materially misstated. If,based on the work we have performed, we conclude that there is a material misstatement of this otherinformation, we are required to report that fact. We have nothing to report in this regard.
Responsibilities of Management and Directors for the Financial Statements
Management is responsible for the preparation and fair presentation of financial statements inaccordance with IFRSs, and for such internal control as management determines is necessary to enablethe preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraudor error.
In preparing the financial statements, management is responsible for assessing the Group’s ability tocontinue as a going concern, disclosing, as applicable, matters related to going concern and using thegoing concern basis of accounting unless management either intends to liquidate the Group or to ceaseoperations, or has no realistic alternative but to do so.
The directors’ responsibilities include overseeing the Group’s financial reporting process.Auditor's Responsibilities for the Audit of the Consolidated Financial Statements
Our objectives are to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements as a wholeare free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error, and to issue an auditor’s reportthat includes our opinion. Reasonable assurance is a high level of assurance, but is not a guaranteethat an audit conducted in accordance with ISAs will always detect a material misstatement when itexists. Misstatements can arise from fraud or error and are considered material if, individually or in theaggregate, they could reasonably be expected to influence the economic decisions of users taken on thebasis of these financial statements.

As part ofan audit in accordance with ISAs, we exercise professional judgement and maintain professionalskepticism throughout the audit. We also:
- Identify and assess the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether dueto fraud or error, design and perform audit procedures responsive to those risks, and obtainaudit evidence that is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for our opinion. The risk of notdetecting a material misstatement resulting from fraud is higher than for one resulting from error,as fraud may involve collusion, forgery, intentional omissions, misrepresentations, or the overrideofinternal control.
- Obtain an understanding of internal control relevant to the audit in orderto design audit proceduresthat are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on theeffectiveness of the Group’s internal control.
- Evaluate the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accountingestimates and related disclosures made by management.
- Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accountingand, based on the audit evidence obtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to eventsor conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.Ifwe conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor’sreport to the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate,to modify our opinion. Our conclusions are based on the audit evidence obtained up to the dateof our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause the Group to cease tocontinue as a going concern.
- Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the financial statements, including thedisclosures, and whether the financial statements represent the underlying transactions and eventsin a manner that achieves fair presentation.
- Obtain sufficient appropriate audit evidence regarding the financial information of the entities orbusiness activities within the Group to express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements.We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance of the group audit. We remainsolely responsible for our audit opinion.
We communicate with the directors regarding, among other matters, the planned scope and timing ofthe audit and significant audit findings, including any significant deficiencies in internal control that weidentify during our audit.
We also provide the directors with a statement that we have complied with relevant ethical requirementsregarding independence, and to communicate with them all relationships and other matters that mayreasonably be thought to bear on our independence, and where applicable, related safeguards.
From the matters communicated with the directors, we determine those matters that were of mostsignificance in the audit of the financial statements of the current period and are therefore the key auditmatters. We describe these matters in our auditor’s report unless law or regulation precludes publicdisclosure about the matter or when, in extremely rare circumstances, we determine that a matter shouldnot be communicated in our report because the adverse consequences of doing so would reasonably beexpected to outweigh the public interest benefits of such communication.
The engagement partner on the audit resulting in this independent auditor’s report is Adrian Koh.

Control is achieved when the Group isexposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee andhas the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. Speciﬁcally,the Group controls an investee if, and only if, the Group has:
- Power over the investee (i.e., existing rights that give it the current ability to directthe relevant activities of the investee)
- Exposure, or rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee
- The ability to use its power over the investee to affect its returns
Generally, there is a presumption that a majority of voting rights results in control. Tosupport this presumption and when the Group has less than a majority ofthe voting orsimilar rights ofan investee, the Group considers all relevant facts and circumstancesin assessing whether it has power over an investee, including:
- The contractual arrangement(s) with the other vote holders of the investee- Rights arising from other contractual arrangements- The Group’s voting rights and potential voting rights
he Group re-assesses whether or not it controls an investee iffacts and circumstancesindicate that there are changes to one or more of the three elements of control.Consolidation ofa subsidiary begins when the Group obtains control over the subsidiaryand ceases when the Group loses control of the subsidiary. Assets, liabilities, incomeand expenses of a subsidiary acquired or disposed of during the year are included inhe consolidated financial statements from the date the Group gains control until thedate the Group ceases to control the subsidiary.
3rofit or loss and each component of other comprehensive income are attributed tohe equity holders of the parent of the Group and to the non-controlling interests,even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance. Whennecessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bringheir accounting policies into line with the Group’s accounting policies. All intra-groupassets and liabilities, equity, income, expenses and cash flows relating to transactionsoetween members of the Group are eliminated in full on consolidation.
A change in the ownership interest of a subsidiary, without a loss of control, isaccounted for as an equity transaction.

fthe Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the related assets (includinggoodwill), liabilities, non—controlling interest and other components of equity, whileany resultant gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. Any investment retained isrecognised at fair value.

Business combination and goodwill
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The cost ofan acquisition is measured as the aggregate of the consideration transferred, which ismeasured at acquisition date fair value, and the amount ofany non-controlling interestsin the acquiree. For each business combination, the Group elects whether to measurethe non—controlling interests in the acquiree at fair value or at the proportionate shareof the acquiree’s identifiable net assets. Acquisition-related costs are expensed asincurred and included in administrative expenses.
When the Group acquires a business, it assesses the financial assets and liabilitiesassumed for appropriate classification and designation in accordance with thecontractual terms, economic circumstances and pertinent conditions as at theacquisition date. This includes the separation of embedded derivatives in host contractsby the acquiree.
Any contingent consideration to be transferred by the acquirer will be recognised atfair value at the acquisition date. Contingent consideration classified as an asset orliability that is a financial instrument and within the scope of International AccountingStandards (IAS) 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, is measuredat fair value with the changes in fair value recognised in the statement of profit or loss.
Goodwill is initially measured at cost (being the excess of the aggregate of theconsideration transferred and the amount recognised for non-controlling interestsand anyJJrevious interest held over the net identifiable assets acquired and liabilitiesassume ). If the fair value of the net assets acquired is in excess of the aggregateconsideration transferred, the Group re-assesses whether it has correctly identified allofthe assets acquired and all of the liabilities assumed and reviews the procedures usedto measure the amounts to be recognised at the acquisition date. Ifthe reassessmentstill results in an excess of the fair value of net assets acquired over the aggregateconsideration transferred, then the gain is recognised in profit or loss.
After initial recognition, goodwill is measured at cost less any accumulated impairmentlosses. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill acquired in a businesscombination is, from the acquisition date, allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units that are expected to benefit from the combination, irrespective ofwhether other assets or liabilities of the acquiree are assigned to those units.
Where goodwill has been allocated to a cash-generating unit (CGU) and part of theoperation within that unit is disposed of, the goodwill associated with the disposedoperation is included in the carrying amount of the operation when determining thegain or loss on disposal. Goodwill disposed in these circumstances is measured basedon the relative values ofthe disposed operation and the portion of the cash—generatingunit retained.

Structured Entities
A structured entity is an entity that has been designed so that voting or similar rightsare not the dominant factor in deciding who controls the entity, such as when anyvoting rights relate to administrative tasks only and the relevant activities are directedby means of contractual arrangements. A structured entity often has some or all ofthefollowing features or attributes: (a) restricted activities; (b) a narrow and well—definedobjective, such as to provide investment opportunities for investors by passing onrisks and rewards associated with the assets of the structured entity to investors;(c) insufficient equity to permit the structured entity to finance its activities withoutsubordinated financial support; and (d) financing in the form of multiple contractuallylinked instruments to investors that create concentrations of credit or other risks(tranches).
The Group considers all ofits investment in securitisation vehicles through the purchaseof Australian backed securities (ABS) and collateralised loan obligation (CLO) notes tobe an interest in unconsolidated structured entities as it does not have any power overthese entities such that its involvement will vary its returns from these entities.
(C) FOREIGN CURRENCY TRANSLATION
(1)
Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measuredusing the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates(the functional currency). The financial statements are presented in SGD, which is theCompany’s functional currency.
Transactions and balances
Transactions in a currency other than the functional currency (foreign currency) aretranslated into the functional currency using the exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions. Currency translation differences resulting from the settlement of suchtransactions and from the translation of monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin foreign currencies at the closing rates at the balance sheet date are recognised inprofit or loss.
Non-monetary items denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fairvalues are translated to the functional currency using the exchange rates at the datewhen the fair values are determined. The gain or loss arising on translation of suchitems is treated in line with the recognition of the gain or loss on the change in fairvalue of the item (i.e., translation differences on items whose fair value gain or lossis recognised in other comprehensive income or profit or loss are also recognised inother comprehensive income or profit or loss, respectively).

(b) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at averageexchange rates (unless this average is not a reasonable approximation of thecumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which caseincome and expenses are translated using exchange rates at the dates of thetransactions); and
(c) all resulting currency translation differences are recognised in othercomprehensive income and accumulated in the currency translation reserve.These currency translation differences are reclassified to profit or loss ondisposal or partial disposal of the entity giving rise to such reserve.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity aretreated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
INVESTMENTS IN SUBSIDIARIES
Investments in subsidiaries are carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses in theCompany’s balance sheet. On disposal ofsuch investments, the differences between disposalproceeds and the carrying amounts of the investments are recognised in profit or loss.
Dividends received from subsidiaries are recognised in profit or loss in the separate financialstatements of the Company.
FAIR VALUE ESTIMATION
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in anorderly transaction between market participants at the measurement date. The fair value offinancial assets and liabilities traded in active markets (such as trading securities) are basedon current bid price at the reporting date.
The fair value of available—for—sale financial assets that are not quoted in active marketsis determined by using valuation techniques. Valuation techniques include the use ofdiscounted cash flow analysis, valuation of similar investments and reference to recent salestransactions ofthe same or similar assets. Where appropriate, quoted market prices, brokeror dealer quotes for similar instruments are used. The Group uses a variety of methodsand makes assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each statement offinancial position date.

FINANCIAL ASSETS
The Group classifies its financial assets in the following categories: at fair value throughprofit or loss, loans and receivables, and availabIe-for-sale. The classification depends on thenature of the asset and purpose for which the financial assets were acquired. The Managerdetermines the classification of its financial assets at initial recognition.
Regular way purchases and sales of financial assets are recognised on trade date — the dateon which the Group or Company commits to purchase or sell the asset.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive cash flows from the financialassets have expired or have been transferred and the Group has transferred substantially allrisks and rewards of ownership. On disposal ofa financial asset, the difference between thecarrying amount and the sales proceeds is recognised in profit or loss. Any amount previouslyrecognised in other comprehensive income relating to that asset is rec assified to profit orloss.
(1) AvailabIe—for—sale financial assets
AvailabIe-for—sale financial assets are non-derivative financial assets that are eitherdesignated in this category or not classified in any of the other categories of financialassets. They are presented as non-current assets unless the investment matures orthe Manager intends to dispose ofthe assets within12 months after the balance sheetdate.
AvailabIe-for-sale financial assets are initially recognised at fair value plus transactioncosts and subsequently carried at fair value. Changes in fairvalues of availabIe—for—saledebt securities (i.e. monetary items) denominated in foreign currencies are analysedinto currency translation differences on the amortised cost of the securities and otherchanges; the currency translation differences are recognised in profit or loss and theother changes are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in thefair value reserve. Changes in fair values of availabIe-for-sale equity securities (Le. non-monetary items) are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated inthe fair value reserve, together with related currency translation differences.
Interest and dividend income on availabIe-for-sale financial assets are recognisedseparately in income.
(ii) Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non—derivative financial assets with fixed or determinablepayments that are not quoted in an active market. They are presented as currentassets, except for those expected to be realised later than 12 months after the balancesheet date which are presented as non-current assets. They are recognised initially atfair value plus transaction costs and subsequently measured at amortised cost usingthe effective interest method.

Financial assets at fairvalue through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for trading, and thosedesignated at fair value through profit or loss at inception. A financial asset is classifiedas held for trading if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling in the shortterm. Financial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss at inceptionare those that are managed and their performances are evaluated on a fair valuebasis, in accordance with a documented Group investment strategy. Derivatives arealso categorised as held for trading unless they are designated as effective hedginginstruments as defined by |AS39. Assets in this category are presented as current assetsifthey are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months afterthe balance sheet date, otherwise they are classified as non—current.
Financial assets carried at fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised atfair value, and transaction costs are expensed in the profit or loss. Changes in the fairvalues of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss including the effects ofcurrency translation, interest and dividends, are recognised in profit or loss when thechanges arise.
Gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of the ’financial assets at fair valuethrough profit or loss’ category are presented in the profit or loss within 'Net gain onfinancial assets designated at fair value through profit or loss’ in the period in whichthey arise. Interest on debt securities at fair value through profit or loss is recognisedin profit or loss separately.
FINANCIAL LIABILITIES
(i)
(ii)
(iii)
Initial recognition and measurement
Financial liabilities are recognised when, and only when, the Group becomes a partyto the contractual provisions of the financial instrument. The Group determines theclassification of its financial liabilities at initial recognition.
All financial liabilities are recognised initially at fair value plus in the case of financialliabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, directly attributable transaction costs.
Subsequent measurement
After initial recognition, financial liabilities that are not carried at fair value throughprofit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interestmethod. Gains and losses are recognised in profit or loss when the liabilities arederecognised, and through the amortisation process.
De»recognition
A financial liability is de-recognised when the obligation under the liability is dischargedor cancelled or expires. When an existing financial liability is replaced by another fromthe same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of an existing liability aresubstantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de»recognitionof the original liability and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in therespective carrying amounts is recognised in profit or loss.

(H) IMPAIRMENT OF FINANCIAL ASSETS
(i)
(ii)
Assets carried at amortised cost
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objectiveevidence that a financial asset or group of financial assets is impaired. A financial assetor a group of financial assets is impaired and impairment losses are incurred onlyif there is objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more events thatoccurred after the initial recognition of the asset (a 'loss event’) and that loss event (orevents) has an impact on the estimated future cash flows ofthe financial asset or groupofﬁnancial assets that can be reliably estimated.
Evidence of impairment may include indications that the issuer or obligor is experiencingsignificant financial difﬁculty, default or delinquency in interest or principal payments,the probability that they will enter bankruptcy or other financial reorganisation, andwhere observable data indicate that there is a measurable decrease in the estimatedfuture cash flows, such as changes in arrears or national or local economic conditionsthat correlate with defaults on the assets.
For the loans and receivables category, the amount of the loss is measured as thedifference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimatedfuture cash flows (excluding future credit losses that have not been incurred) discountedat the financial asset's original effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the assetis reduced and the amount ofthe loss is recognised in profit or loss. lfa financial assethas a variable interest rate, the discount rate for measuring any impairment loss is thecurrent effective interest rate determined under the contract. As a practical expedient,the Group may measure impairment on the basis of an instrument’s fair value usingan observable market price.
If, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and thedecrease can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment wasrecognised (such as an improvement in the debtor’s credit rating), the reversal of thepreviously recognised impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
Assets classified as available-for-sale
The Group assesses at the end of each reporting period whether there is objectiveevidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is impaired. For debtsecurities, the Group uses the criteria referred to in (i) above. In the case of equityinvestments classified as availabIe-for-sale, a significant or prolonged decline in thefair value of the security below its cost is also evidence that the assets are impaired.If any such evidence exists for availabIe-for—sale financial assets, the cumulativeloss — measured as the difference between the acquisition cost and the current fairvalue, less any impairment loss on that financial asset previously recognised in profitor loss — is removed from equity and recognised in profit or loss. Impairment lossesrecognised in the profit or loss on equity instruments are not reversed through theprofit or loss. Any subsequent increase in the fair value of such assets is recognisedin other comprehensive income and presented in the available-for-sale financialassets revaluation reserve in equity. If, in a subsequent period, the fairvalue ofa debtinstrument classified as availabIe-for-sale increases and the increase can be objectivelyrelated to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised in profit or loss,the impairment loss is reversed through the profit or loss.

IMPAIRMENT OF NON-FINANCIAL ASSETS
Investments in subsidiaries are tested for impairment whenever there is any objectiveevidence or indication that these assets may be impaired.
For the purpose of impairment testing, the recoverable amount (i.e. the higher of the fairvalue less cost to sell and the value-in-use) is determined on an individual asset basis unlessthe asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from otherassets or group of assets.
If the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated to be less than its carr ing amount, thecarrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. The di erence betweenthe carrying amount and recoverable amount is recognised as an impairment loss in profitor loss.
An impairment loss for an asset other than goodwill is reversed only if, there has been achange in the estimates used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount since the lastimpairment loss was recognised. The carrying amount of this asset is increased to its revisedrecoverable amount, provided that this amount does not exceed the carrying amount thatwould have been determined (net ofany accumulated amortisation or depreciation) had noimpairment loss been recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of impairment lossfor an asset other than goodwill is recognised in profit or loss.
Non»financia| assets other than goodwill that suffered an impairment are reviewed forpossible reversal of the impairment at each reporting date.
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and deposits with financial institutionswhich are subject to an insignificant risk of change in value.
PROVISIONS
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as aresult of past events; it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle theobligation; and the amount has been reliably estimated. Provisions are not recognised forfuture operating losses.
Where there are a number ofsimilar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow will be requiredin settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision isrecognised even ifthe likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in thesame class ofobligations may be small.
Provisions are measured at the present value ofthe expenditures expected to be required tosettle the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the timevalue of money and the risks specific to the obligation. The increase in the provision due topassage of time is recognised as interest expense.

DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS AND HEDGING ACTIVITIES
The Group may use derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure to interest rate andforeign exchange risks arising from operating, financing and investing activities. The Groupdoes not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is enteredinto and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. The method of recognisingthe resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedginginstrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certainderivatives as either:
i. hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fairvalue hedge); or
ii. hedges ofa particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highlyprobable forecast transaction (cash flow hedge); or
iii. hedges ofa net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedge).
The Group documents at the inception of the transaction the relationship between hedginginstruments and hedged items, as well as its risk management objectives and strategy forundertaking various hedging transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both athedge inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in hedgingtransactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedgeditems.
The full fair value ofa hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability whenthe remaining hedged item is more than 12 months and as a current asset or liability whenthe remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than 12 months. Trading derivatives areclassified as a current asset or liability.
(1) Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair valuehedges are recorded in profit or loss, together with any changes in the fair value of thehedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk.
Hedges that meet the strict criteria for hedge accounting are accounted for, asdescribed below:
For fair value hedges relating to items carried at amortised cost, any adjustment tocarrying value is amortised through profit or loss over the remaining term ofthe hedgeusing the effective interest rate method. Effective interest rate amortisation may beginas soon as an adjustment exists and no later than when the hedged item ceases to beadjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk being hedged.
If the hedged item is derecognised, the unamortised fair value is recognisedimmediately in profit or loss.
When an unreco nised firm commitment is designated as a hedged item, thesubsequent cumu ative change in the fair value of the firm commitment attributableto the hedged risk is recognised as an asset or liability with a corresponding gain orloss recognised in profit and loss.

Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised inother comprehensive income in the cash flow hedge reserve, while any ineffectiveportion is recognised immediately in the statement of profit or loss.
Amounts recognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to profit or losswhen the hedged transaction affects profit or loss, such as when the hedged financialincome or financial expense is recognised or when a forecast sale occurs. When thehedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the amountsrecognised as other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial carryingamount ofthe non-ﬁnancial asset or liability.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised withoutreplacement or rollover (as part of the hedging strategy), or if its designation as a hedgeis revoked, or when the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, anycumulative gain or loss previously recognised in other comprehensive income remainsseparately in equity until the forecast transaction occurs or the foreign currency firmcommitment is met.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cashflow hedges. Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portionof the hedge is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss relating tothe ineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in profit or loss when the foreignoperation is partially disposed of or sold.
As at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, the Group does not apply hedge accounting.

The Group makesjudgements estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts ofrevenue, expenses, assets and liabilities. Estimates and judgements are continually evaluated andare based on historical experience and other factors, including expectations of future events thatare believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Uncertainty about these assumptions andestimates could result in outcomes that require a material adjustment to the carrying amount ofassets or liabilities affected in future periods.

Impairment of loan portfolio and securitisation assets classified as available»for»sa|e or loansand receivable financial assets
The carrying values of loan portfolio and securitisation assets are reviewed on a quarterlybasis for indications of impairment or reversal of prior impairment losses. Indicators such aschanges in interest rates, creditworthiness of borrowers in the case of loans, performance ofthe underlying collateral against which the notes have been issued, available broker quotesand, where applicable, other asset specific and industry and economic factors are consideredas part of the assessment. Further, as certain notes are managed by third party managers,the Manager relies on information such as collateral performance and cashflows of theunderlying portfolio which may be provided by third party managers on a Iaggard basis.Whilst the Manager will consider all information obtained as part of the assessment of thevaluation of the investments, there may also be instances where the Manager will make bestestimates as required, particularly in situations where there are developments that mayimpact the underlying portfolio but which may not have been included in the third partymanagers’ reports.
Therefore, in view of the above factors, judgement has been applied in concluding whetherthere is an indication of impairment. To the extent that an indication of impairment isidentified, a detailed assessment of the recoverable amount is performed.
Estimate of cashflows and effective interest rates of investments
The Group has invested in instruments which are at a discount to the issuance price. Suchinvestments include certain positions in the CLO notes. In determining the effective interestrate of such investments, the projected cashflows are initially estimated. As the projectedcashflows are inherently estimates, so is the effective interest rates computed for theseinvestments. Over the life of the investments, the actual cashflows may differ from theprojected cashflows that were initially estimated. Judgement is exercised by the Group toform a conclusion as to whether the projected cashflows initially estimated would need tobe re-estimated in light of actual cashflows. This would have a corresponding impact oneither the effective interest rate or the impairment allowance. Judgement has been appliedin concluding that the estimate of effective interest rates remains appropriate.
Fair value of securities not quoted in an active market
The fairvalue of securities not quoted in an active market is usually determined by the Groupusing broker or dealer quotes, which may be indicative and not executable or binding. TheGroup exercisesjudgement in its assessment of the appropriateness of the quotes obtained,which may consider factors such as the performance of the underlying loan portfolio basedon reports obtained from third party managers, assessment of expected future cash flows,recent transactions in the same or similar instrument and the volatility of and spread betweenbroker quotes obtained.

FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: interest rate risk, currency risk, creditrisk, market price risk, liquidity risk and capital risk.
The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the unpredictability of financialmarkets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance.
The Board is responsible for setting the objectives and underlying principles of financial riskmanagement for the Group. The Audit and Risk Management Committee (ARMC) then establishesthe policies such as authority levels, oversight responsibilities, risk identification and measurement,exposure limits and hedging strategies in accordance with the objectives and underlying principlesapproved by the Board.
Importantly, to the extent an investment matures or a divestment is made, the Group will make adecision at that time about usage or redeployment of underlying capital.
The Group's overall risk management strategy seeks to minimise adverse effects on the Group’sability to pay dividends and the value of the underlying investments. The Group’s approach tomanagement ofﬁnancial risks is both top down and bottom up in the sense ofanalysing risks at aGroup level as well as at an investment—specific level.
Financial risk management is carried out by the Manager in accordance with the policies set bythe ARMC. The Manager identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. This involves regularsensitivity testing and various levels of reporting through the Group, including regular formalreporting to the ARMC and the Board.
At an investment level, the Group aims to reduce financial risks through structuring the manner inwhich the investment is acquired or funded. At a Group level, financial instruments such as interestrate swaps may be used to reduce interest rate risks together with other additional measures suchas investing in a portfolio comprising various targeted asset classes, sectors, countries, maturities,and return profile.

INTEREST RATE RISK
Interest rate risk can be cash flow related or fairvalue related. Cash ﬂow interest rate risk isthe risk that future cash ﬂows of a financial instrument will fluctuate because of changes inmarket interest rates. Fair value interest rate risk is the risk that the fair value of a financialinstrument will fluctuate due to changes in market interest rates.
The Group holds a portfolio of fixed and variable rate bond securities that expose the Groupto fairvalue interest rate risk. The Group also holds a portfolio ofvariable rate ABS and CLOnotes that expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
The Group seeks to minimise interest rate risk by structuring the portfolio in a manner so asto reduce the likelihood that an adverse movement ofinterest rate in onejurisdiction wouldhave a material impact on overall cash flow or fair value. This includes maintaining diversityin the nature of the returns from the underlying investments, ranging from variable interestreturns and fixed interest returns. The Company may hedge the interest rate exposureinherent in the underlying investments if possible and appropriate.
Exposure to interest rate risksThe table below sets out the Group and the Company’s exposure to interest rate risks as at
31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. Included in the table are the key interest-bearingfinancial assets of the Group and the Company at their carrying amount.

FOREIGN CURRENCY RISK
Foreign currency risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of an exposure willfluctuate because of change in foreign currency rates.
The Group receives dividend income, interest income and disposal proceeds substantiallydenominated in currencies other than SGD. Movements in currency exchange rates betweenthe relevant foreign currencies and SGD may therefore have a material effect on the Grou ’5financial results to the extent that they are not hedged, and the amount available ordistribution as dividends to the Shareholders.
The Group manages this risk by taking advantage of any natural offsets of receipts andpayments in each individual currency. Surplus of foreign currencies are sold, as soon aspracticable, for SGD. Forward foreign exchange contracts are used purely as a hedging tool,where an active market for the relevant currency exists, to minimise the Group’s exposureto movements in exchange rates on firm commitments and specific transactions. The Groupwill also monitor currency exposure and may enter into hedging arrangements whereappropriate.
Sensitivity analysis around currency fluctuations is periodically performed by the Managerand reported to the Board.
The tables below set out the Group’s and the Company’s key currency exposure arising frommonetary items as at 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016.

CREDIT RISK
The Group is exposed to credit risk, which is the risk that one party to a financial instrumentwill cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation.
The main concentration to which the Group is exposed arises from the Group’s investmentin debt securities (comprising bonds and bank contingent convertibles) and loan portfolioand securitisation assets (comprising ABS and CLO notes). The Group is also exposed tocounterparty credit risk on cash and cash equivalents and other assets.
The Manager seeks to mitigate this risk through asset selection process, the structuring ofinvestments to minimise credit risk where possible, active ongoing monitoring ofthe Group’sinvestments and overall investment policy which is designed for targeted asset classes,sectors, maturities, obligors, countries, currencies and return profile. Credit limits have beenestablished to ensure that the Group deals with creditworthy counterparties for investmentsand hedging transactions and that counterparty concentration risk is addressed and the riskof loss is mitigated.
A significant element of the monitoring involves conducting due diligence in respect ofservicers, originators and managers of the Group’s investments including regular meetingswith senior management.
The Manager also conducts ongoing monitoring of the Group’s investments through thefollowing procedures:
- reviews of investment reports in respect of each investment (for example trusteereports);- monitoring and analysing performance metrics such as dividend income received,
credit enhancement levels, arrears and default data, performance triggers andprepayment rates in relation to our investments;
- monitoring of servicer and manager performance as measured by rating agencyreports and performance in similar transactions where possible;
- surveillance of rating changes and reports and relevant research reports;
- analysing macroeconomic factors to gauge possible effects on the performance ofour
investments; and
- regular contact with industry participants including rating agencies, trustees,originators, arrangers and servicers.

At 31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016, substantially all cash and cash equivalents andinvestments were placed in custody with well-established financial institutions. It is expectedthat all assets deposited with these financial institutions will be clearly identified as beingthe assets of the Group; the Group should not therefore be exposed to a credit risk withrespect to such parties.

MARKET PRICE RISK
Market price risk in the context of the Group and its underlying investments is the risk thatthe market determined price of an investment (both listed and unlisted) declines, resultingin an unrealised loss in the value of an investment.
The Group does not actively hedge its exposure to the risk of a general decline in equitymarket values. To manage market price risk, the Group would maintain a portfolio acrossvarious targeted markets, industries, originators and segments so as to reduce the risk thata fall in the market price of one investment, and consequently the value of the investment,would be extended across a large proportion of the portfolio.
The investment management policy whereby each individual investment is closely monitoredon an ongoing basis ensures that the Manager is in the best possible position to identify anypotential concerns early and act quickly.
Any temporary market price fall would only be realised in an economic sense when aninvestment was disposed of. The Group is intending to hold the majority of the investmentsin the portfolio for long term therefore reducing the risk of any temporary declines in valueof such investments being realised.
The table below sets out the Group and the Company’s exposure to market price risks as at31 December 2017 and 31 December 2016. included in the table are the financial assets ofthe Group and the Company at their carrying amount.

The fair value of financial instruments quoted in active markets is based on quoted marketprices at the statement of financial position date. The quoted market price used for financialassets held by the Group is the current bid price. These instruments are included in Level 1and comprise listed equity securities and quoted bonds and bank contingent convertibles.
The fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market is determinedby using valuation techniques. These valuation techniques maximise the use of observablemarket data where it is available and rely as little as possible on estimates. If all significantinputs required to fair value the financial assets are observable, the financial assets areincluded in Level 2.
Investments classified within Level 3 have significant unobservable inputs, as they tradeinfrequently. Level 3 instruments include the following investments:
(i) Listed Equity
As at 31 December 2017, the listed equity was still suspended with no observable price.The listed equity was previously fully impaired due to the prolonged suspension.
(ii) CLO Investments
As observable prices are not available for the CLO investments, the Group has usedbroker or dealer quotes, which may be indicative and not executable or binding, toestimate their fairvalue.
Level 3 valuations are reported on a quarterly basis to the Board. The Board considersa number of factors when assessing the appropriateness of the valuation basis andthe valuation result, which may include: performance of the underlying loan portfolioor underlying assets if available, assessment of expected future cash flows, recenttransactions in the same or similar instrument and the volatility ofand spread between
broker quotes obtained.
As at 31 December 2016, Avoca CLO PLC VI Class M and Avoca CLO PLC VII Class Gwere valued at the lower of the two broker quotes at S$O.78 million and $130.31 million,respectively as a result of the assessment above.
During the year, Avoca CLO PLC V1 Class M and Avoca CLO PLC V|| Class G were called.As at 31 December 2017, both notes were valued based on estimated distributionproceeds as the securitisation vehicles were pending liquidation. This is recorded in“other assets” (Note 17).
