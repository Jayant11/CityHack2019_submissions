Our audit approach
An audit is designed to provide reasonable assurance about whether the ﬁnancial report is free frommaterial misstatement. Misstatements may arise due to fraud or error. They are considered material ifindividually or in aggregate, they could reasonably be expected to inﬂuence the economic decisions ofusers taken on the basis of the ﬁnancial report.
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to give an opinion on theﬁnancial report as a whole, taking into account the geographic and management structure of theTransurban Group, THT and TIL, their accounting processes and controls and the industry in whichthey operate.
o For the purpose of our audit of the Group we used overall group materiality of $38 million, which representsapproximately 2.5% of the earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation expenses (EBITDA) ofthe Group.
0 We applied this threshold, together with qualitative considerations, to determine the scope of our audit andthe nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements on theﬁnancial report as a whole.
a We chose EBITDA as the benchmark because, in our view, it is the metric against which the performance ofthe ’Itansurban Group is most commonly measured and is a generally accepted benchmark in theinfrastructure industry. We chose 2.5% based on our professional judgement, noting that it is within thecommon range relative to EBITDA benchmarks.
. Our audit focused on where the Group made subjective judgements; for example, signiﬁcant accountingestimates involving assumptions and inherently uncertain future events.
0 We conducted an audit of the ﬁnancial report for each of the 'Itansurban Group, THT and TIL, includingsubstantive audit procedures in respect of the operation of each of the toll road concessions and equityaccounted investments. Speciﬁc audit procedures were also performed for interest, tax, depreciation andamortisation expenses.

Key audit matters
Key audit matters are those matters that, in our professional judgement, were of most signiﬁcance inour audit of the ﬁnancial report for the current period and were determined separately for the Group,THT and TIL. Relevant amounts listed for each part of the stapled group represent balances as they arepresented in the ﬁnancial report and should not be aggregated. The key audit matters were addressedin the context of our audit of the ﬁnancial report as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, andwe do not provide a separate opinion on these matters. We communicated the key audit matters to theAudit and Risk Committee.

Key audit matter
The Transurhan Group operates toll roads in 4 geographicsegments: Melbourne, Sydney and Brisbane in Australia and theGreater Washington Area in the United States. Each toll roadrecords and recognises revenue through the me of technology,speciﬁcally, road side equipment supported by tolling and billingsystems.
Telling equipment and systems are highly customised complexsystems that are built with the purpose of correctly identifyingvehicle type, calculating correct fare and linking the vehicle to thecustomer’s account for billing purposes or obtaining informationfrom local transport authorities for vehicles that have not made avalid billing arrangement.
Every toll road operates under a different concession deed whichgoverns the means by which customers are charged.
This was a key audit matter for the Group and TIL due to the largevolume of transactions that were processed in the year, the uniquenature of each toll road and the reliance on bespoke informationtechnology systems and controls.
This is the ﬁrst ﬁnancial year in which Airportlink M7 revenue isincluded for the full 12 month period.

Borrowings are an integral part of the Transurban Group’sbusiness model as it is the key source of funds used by thebusiness to fund new projects and upgrades to existing concessionassets. Borrowings represent the largest liability on the balancesheets.
During the year the Transurban Group reﬁnanced over $2 billionof borrowings through bonds issuances and new bank facilities.Each of the borrowing agreements has its own set of terms andconditions and therefore audit work was required to assess thetreatment of the agreements and their impact on the ﬁnancialstatements.
Given the size of the borrowings balance, the number ofborrowing agreements in place and the importance of the fundingstructure for continued growth, the accounting for bonowings wasconsidered a key audit matter for the Group, ’I'HT and TIL.

Key audit matter
Each of the concession assets in the Transurban Group's portfoliorepresents a contractual right under a concessional agreement totoll a road in return for the capital and expertise needed to build,maintain and operate the road.
Every concession asset is governed by its own concessionagreement between the Group and the concession grantor(typically government or a local transport authority of the regionin which concession is granted). As a result, the 'ItansurhanGroup is subject to a number of contractual obligations, some ofwhich have a direct impact on ﬁnancial statements. Whenever theGroup undertakes a new project to construct, acquire or upgradethe asset, its contractual arrangements with concession grantorsare altered either through a new concession agreement or anamendment of the existing concessional agreement.
The right to receive future economic beneﬁts is recognised on thebalance sheet as a concession asset. The asset is recognised at costof construction or price paid at acquisition. The Group monitorsperformance of the assets for indicators of impairment at the endof each reporting period. Where indicators are identiﬁed duringthe period, the Group compares the carrying amount to itsestimate of the recoverable amount of the asset.
The concession agreements also contain clauses that require theTransurban Group to make cash outﬂows in the future, resultingin the recognition of concession liabilities such as maintenanceliabilities, concession note liabilities and contingent considerationliabilities.
The concession asset recoverable amount and concessionliabilities recognised are calculated by estimating the net presentvalue of future cash ﬂows of the concession agreements usingdiscounted cash ﬂow models (the models). This area requiressigniﬁcant judgement by the Group due to a number of uncertainassumptions that impact the timing and quantum of future cashﬂows generated by the toll road, speciﬁcally assumptions such asfuture trafﬁc expectations, operating costs, maintenance cashoutﬂows and ﬁnance cost forecasts.
We considered this to be a key audit matter for the Group, THTand TIL due to the accounting complexity of the arrangementsand judgement required to interpret the accounting requirementsand calculate their impact on the ﬁnancial statements.
During the year and up to the date of this report the Groupreached ﬁnancial close on the Inner City Bypass upgrade project,Logan Enhancement Project and 395 Express Lanes Project. Eachof these projects resulted in changes to the contractual obligationsof the Group. In addition to that, as projects such as the CityLinkTulla Widening progress further and conditions of the agreementsare satisﬁed, audit work was required to assess the impact onﬁnancial statements.

Taxation was a key audit matter for the Group and TIL due to theaccounting complexity of the calculations, judgemental nature andexpertise required to estimate the tax position recorded.
The Transurban Group is subject to income taxes in Australia andthe United States. Judgement is required in determining theprovision for income taxes.
The Group is also subject to a number of industry speciﬁc taxrules and provisions which require signiﬁcant judgement anddetailed understanding of the legislation and relevant case law.
Some of the tax provisions are subject to interpretation andtherefore for some transactions the ultimate tax determination isuncertain.
Deferred tax assets relating to carried forward tax losses arerecognised to the extent there are sufﬁcient taxable temporarydifferences relating to the same taxation authority against whichthe unused tax losses can be utilised. The assumptions supportingthis position are dependent on future cash ﬂows generated fromthe toll roads operating in each tax group. Future taxable proﬁtswill need to be generated in order to support the recognition of thedeferred tax assets. In the United States tax losses expire after a20 year period.
Due to the stapled structure of the Group, tax calculations arecomplex and require the Group to make judgments andassumptions. Furthermore, as described in note B7 theTransurban Group contains 4 different tax consolidated groupswith their own Tax Sharing and Tax Funding agreements, each ofwhich creates additional complexities in the calculations.

Remuneration report (continued)
1. Remuneration snapshot
The Board is committed to an executive remuneration framework that is focused on driving a performance culture andlinking pay to the achievement of the Group’s strategy and business objectives that in turn drive Iong-term securityholder value.
Transurban's remuneration framework is reviewed annually taking into consideration security holder and otherstakeholder feedback, market expectations and regulatory developments.
At the 2016 Annual General meeting (‘AGM‘), the remuneration framework received strong support from securityholders, with a 97.14% vote in favour of the resolution to adopt the 2016 Remuneration Report (2015: 99.52%),
The Board considers that the current remuneration framework offers a range of mechanisms to balance sensible riskmanagement and motivate executives to deliver outstanding results.
Transurban’s core strategy is to partner with Governments to provide effective and innovative urban roadinfrastructure. Consistent with this strategy, the Group has significantly expanded its portfolio with acquisitions anddevelopment projects in Australia and the USA, leveraging its urban networks and partnering with Governments todevelop transport solutions in our core markets of the east coast of Australia and North America. These activitieshave helped deliver against the Group's stated objective of growing distributions for security holders.
The remuneration outcomes this year reflect Transurban’s strong financial results and achievements across theGroup's operational and development activities, These results are outlined in more detail in the Operating andFinancial Review within the Directors’ Report.
Key measures of the results achieved in FY17 included:
- 10.1% increase in underlying proportional EBITDA;. 27.4% increase in free cash flow per security; and- 13.2% increase in distributions paid to security holders,
These results have been achieved during a period of signiﬁcant development activity for the business, reﬂected in thesubstantial development pipeline which includes major enhancement projects across all markets. This contributed toan 11.1% increase in proportional net costs (excluding signiﬁcant items) to support strategic growth and developmentprojects and underlying business activity.
The Board and the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee believe that the remuneration outcomes reﬂectalignment between rewarding senior executive efforts in meeting or exceeding key targets and recognising securityholder outcomes.

3. Remuneration governance
A. Board and Remuneration and Human Resources Committee responsibilities
The Remuneration and Human Resources Committee assists the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities relating to theremuneration of Non—executive Directors, the remuneration of, and incentives for, the CEO and other seniorexecutives, remuneration budgets for all employees and remuneration practices, strategies and disclosures generally.
It is critical that the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee is independent of management when makingdecisions affecting employee remuneration. Accordingly, the Committee comprises Non—executive Directors, all ofwhom are independent, Where appropriate, the CEO and the Group General Manager, Customer Operations and
Human Resources attend Committee meetings, however they do not participate in formal decision making.
The members of the Committee are Robert Edgar (Chair), Samantha Mostyn, Neil Chatfield, and Jane Wilson (from23 May 2017). Further details regarding the Committee are set out in the Directors‘ Report
B. Use of remuneration consultants
The Remuneration and Human Resources Committee may seek and consider advice from independent remunerationconsultants where appropriate Any advice from consultants is used to guide the Committee and the Board, but doesnot serve as a substitute for thorough consideration by Non—executive Directors.
The Group has a protocol in place governing the appointment of remuneration consultants and the manner in whichany recommendations made by those consultants concerning the remuneration of KMP are to be provided to theGroup, and in particular, the circumstances in which management may be given access to those recommendations.The purpose of the protocol is to ensure that any remuneration recommendations provided by consultants areprovided without undue inﬂuence by KMP.
During FY17, consultants did not provide the Remuneration and Human Resources Committee with remunerationrecommendations relating to KMP. Benchmark data only was provided to the Committee.
C. Dealing in securities
In accordance with the Group's Dealing in Securities Policy, employees who have awards under a Group equity planmay not hedge against those awards. In addition, senior executives may not hedge against entitlements that havevested but remain subject to a holding lock. Directors and employees are also prohibited from entering into marginlending arrangements using Transurban stapled securities as security.
D. Minimum security holding
The Board has endorsed minimum security holding guidelines for Non-executive Directors, the CEO and other seniorexecutives. The guidelines recommend that all participants build and maintain a minimum security holding ofTransurban stapled securities equal in value to their ﬁxed annual remuneration (excluding superannuation). Theminimum stapled security holding can be accumulated over a five year period.

4. Senior executive remuneration policy and structure
The Group's executive remuneration strategy is designed to attract, retain and motivate a highly qualified andexperienced management team with the necessary skills and attributes to lead the Group in achieving its businessobjectives The strategy also aims to encourage management to strive for superior performance by rewarding theachievement of targets that are challenging, clearly understood, and within the control of individuals to achievethrough their own success,
A. Remuneration framework
The Group's remuneration framework provides a combination of incentives intended to drive performance against theGroup’s short and longer term objectives. The framework for the CEO and other senior executives comprises threecomponents:
- Total Employment Cost (‘TEC’): fixed remuneration component comprising salary, superannuation and otherprescribed benefits;
- Short Term Incentive (‘STI’): an ‘at risk’ component, awarded on performance over a 12 month period againstpre-determined individual and Group performance measures that comprises both a cash component and acomponent deferred into equity; and
- Long Term Incentive (‘LTI'): an 'at risk' equity component, awarded on the achievement of pre-determinedinternal and external performance measures over a three year period.B. Remuneration mix
A significant proportion of senior executive remuneration is ‘at risk’ to provide alignment with the interests of securityholders and to drive performance. The remuneration mix is designed to achieve a balanced reward for achievementof immediate objectives and the creation of long term sustainable value. The remuneration mix for target performance(100% vesting of STI and LTI Plans) for seniorexecutives is outlined in the diagram below,
CEO target remuneration mix Senior executive target remuneration mix
lFiXed annual remuneration

V 'bl LT|165% 15% ans e
Changes to CEO remuneration package
As disclosed in last year‘s report, the CEO’s remuneration package for FY17 was revised to better align totalremuneration to the market comparator group, including through a more appropriate weighting for each remunerationcomponent.
C. Fixed total employment cost (‘TEC’)
Fixed TEC is set with reference to the market median, using the ASX 10-30 as the primary reference, Remunerationpackages (including TEC levels) are reviewed annually by the Remuneration and Human Resources Committeetaking into consideration an individual's role, experience and performance, as well as relevant comparative marketdata provided by remuneration consultants TEC levels are also reviewed on a change in role

D. Short term incentive (‘STI’)


Description Eligible permanent Group employees, including the CEO and other senior executives, participate in theannual STI plan, which puts a proportion of remuneration ‘at risk‘ subject to meeting speciﬁc pre-determined Group and individual performance measures linked to Group objectives.
Performance The performance period is the financial year preceding the payment date (La. 1 July 2016 — 30 June
Period 2017).
Opportunity For ‘at-target' performance, the CEO has the opportunity to receive 100% of TEC and all other senior
executives have the opportunity to receive 67% of TEC. The minimum STI an individual can receive is0% (if targets are not met) and the maximum is 150% of the STI opportunity, which is only awarded forexceptional performance,

Payment anddeferral
The awarded STI for the CEO and other senior executives is settled 50% in cash and 50% is deferred.For Australian employees, the deferred component is Transurban stapled securities, which are held ontrust for two years following the performance period and are restricted from trading until vesting. USAemployees were awarded deferred IISh awards in FY17 and in prior years, Commencing 1 July 2017,STI deferred components awarded to USA employees will also be defen‘ed into Transurban stapledsecurities with the same trading restrictions as Australian employees. The deferred securities anddeferred cash awards participate in dividends and/or distributions paid.
The number of securities or awards is determined by dividing the amount to be deferred by a 20 dayVolume Weighted Average Price (VWAP) of securities up to and including the last business day of theperformance period.

Pe rforma neemeasu res
Performance measures are a mix of Group and individual measures. The diagram below illustrates theweighting of the two performance measures‘
Proportional EBITDA 20%
Individual Gm
KPIS 50%
Measures50%
Proportional rm casts 20%
Health, safety 8 Envimnment 10%

Individual KPIs are unique to the individuals area of accountability Individuals have a clear line ofsight to KPls and are able to directly affect outcomes through their own actions.
The total STI performance outcome is calculated: (Individual STI Outcome % + (Individual STIOutcome % x Group Outcome %)) + 2.

Why are theseperformancemeasures used
Proportional EBITDA is one of the primary measures the Board uses to assess the operatingperformance of the Group. It reﬂects the contribution from individual assets to the Group‘s operatingperformance and focuses on elements of the result that management can inﬂuence to driveimprovements in short term eamings‘ The Board believes proportional EBITDA provides a betterreﬂection of the underlying performance of the Group’s assets than statutory EBITDA.
Proportional Net Costs reflects management's ability to influence the expenditure of the business,Strong cost management throughout the business drives an increase in proportional EBITDA and freecash ﬂow and ultimately security holder value.
The HSE measures focus on improving the Group‘s HSE culture and reducing workplace injuries foremployees and contractors, as well as customer safety.


How is the The Board approves a total STI pool to be distributed. One half of the pool represents the individual
annual pool component of the STI (capped at 100%) and the second half of the pool represents the individual
determined component of the STI, multiplied by the Group‘s performance outcome to represent the Group'sperformance component (capped at 150%). The Board has discretion as to the proportion of the poolthat will be distributed each year.
Vesting Performance against Group measures is assessed by the Board and the results of key elements are
independently validated. The Board conﬁrms final outcomes for individual and Group performance andhas discretion to adjust the performance conditions and outcomes.

To determine the nargets tor the Proportional EBITDA measure of the STI program,the Board utilises the annual budget as the primary input The budget incorporatesbase business growth derived from network-wide trafﬁc performance, prioe growthand impacts of inﬂation and adjusts for events such as: construction and projectcompletion and the impact of acquisitions, When approving the budget, the Boardensures that sufﬁcient stretch is incorporated. This is achieved through the analysis ofthe core assumptions underpinning the budget and also through consideration of thequantifiable risks and opportunities that can influence the Group's ﬁnancialperformance. The budget incorporates directly controllable initiatives including roadsafety, lane availability, operational efﬁciencies and the impact of developmentactivity. Once the budget has been finalised, the Board determines the STI targets.The FY17 STI targets excluded Transurban Queensland integration costs and abudget for discretionary research and development initiatives.
The targets use a constant currency for operations within the USA1t

Individual KPIs 50% Individual KPIs related to critical business measures and are not disclosed due to thecommercially sensitive nature of these targets.
E. Long term incentive (‘LTI’)
Description Participation in the LTI plan is offered to the CEO and other senior executives, and a very limitednumber of other employees nominated by the CEO and approved by the Board.
Grants are made in the form of performance awards at no cost to the recipient, Each performanceaward is an entitlement to receive a Transurban stapled security. or an equivalent cash payment, onterms and conditions determined by the Board, subject to the achievement of vesting conditions.

Performance The three financial years commencing on 1 July in the year the grant is made.Period

Opportunity The CEO’s opportunity is 103% of TEC and the opportunity for all other senior executives is 56% ofTEC, Upon vesting of a LTI plan, the minimum vesting outcome an individual can receive is 0% of theawards due to vest (if the performance measures are not achieved) and the maximum vesting outcomean individual can receive is 100% of the awards due to vestt

Performance Two performance measures are used to determine the number of awards that will vest at the end ofmeasures the performance period; relative Total Shareholder Return ('TSR') against a bespoke comparatorgroup and Free Cash Flow (‘FCF’) (each with a 50% weighting).
Why are these TSR is a relative, external, market-based performance measure against those companies with which
performance the Group competes for capital. It provides a direct link between executive reward and security holder
measures used return, TSR measures total return on investment of a security, taking into account both capitalappreciation and distributed and/or dividend income which was reinvested on a pre-tax basis,
Growth in FCF per security reflects the Group’s continued focus on the maximisation of free cash. TheGroup seeks to consistently grow its distributions year on year and to align security holder distributionswith FCF per security.

Allocation
TSR component: An independently determined fair value allocation valuation is applied to thiscomponent of the LTlt
FCF component: An independently determined face value allocation valuation (discounted fordistributions and/or dividends foregone throughout the performance period) is applied to this componentof the LTI.
The Board regularly considers the most apprupriate measures for the Group and believes that fair valueis the correct measure for the TSR component of the LTI awards as it is a market based measure andthe inclusion of market forces within the calculation is appropriate. Whereas the non-market basedperformance measure of FCF is more suited to a face value valuation when allocating LTI awards.

Vesting
TSR component
The Group uses an independent report that sets out the Group's TSR growth and that of each companyin the bespoke comparator group. A VWAP of securities for the 20 trading days up to and including thetesting date is used to calculate TSRt
The level of TSR growth achieved by the Group is given a percenﬁle ranking having regard to theGroup's performance compared to the performance of other companies in the comparator group (thehighest ranking company is ranked at the 100th percentile). This ranking determines the extent to whichperfomance awards, subject to this target. vest.
FCF component
The Group's FCF per security percentage growth rate is calculated based on the FCF per security overthe three year performance period.
The Board determines in its absolute discretion whether the performance awards are settled inTransurban stapled securities or a cash payment of equivalent value. In FY17 and prior years, USAemployees have received cash payments upon vesting. Commencing 1 July 2017, all LTI plan offersmade to USA employees will be under the same conditions as Australian employees in that the Boardin its absolute discretion will determine whether awards are settled in Transurban stapled securities orin cash.
Following testing, any awards that do not vest, lapse and any awards that vest are automaticallyexercised,

Cessation ofemployment
If employment ceases before the performance measures are tested. generally there is no entitlement tounvested performance awards Any unvested awards will lapse, unless the plan rules provide otherwiseor the Board otherwise resolvest


Clawback Fraudulent or dishonest behaviourwill result in the forfeiture or clawback of any unvested awards.Further, at the discretion of the Board, awards are subject to forfeiture or clawback where there is afinancial misstatement circumstance or the allocation of awards was made in error, on the basis of themisrepresentation or an omission, or on the basis of facts or circumstances that were later proven to beuntrue or inaccurate,

The Group seeks to consistently grow its distributions year on year and to align distributions with FCF per security.The FCF per security may not grow each year in line with distributions. Factors that may cause FCF to fluctuate yearon year may include the timing of interest payments, movements in working capital, the impact of major developmentprojects and capital management initiatives, Due to possible fluctuations in FCF, the extent to which distributions arecovered by cash may also fluctuate between 90-110% in any given year, This is consistent with the Group'sdistribution policy of achieving approximately 100% free cash coverage over time. Due to possible ﬂuctuations inFCF, distributions are considered the best point of alignment with security holder expectations for growth in investorreturns‘ In delivering against this measure, the Board also balances the objective of growing distributions with longerdated investments that generate value for the business but may not contribute to distribution growth in the nearterm,The Group has a number of major projects in development through this period, including the CityLink-TuIIa-Wideningin Melbourne, NorthConnex in Sydney, the Logan Enhancement Project in Brisbane as well as other potentialdevelopments on each of our networks. The Board takes this into account when setting the range to ensureappropriately challenging measures
For performance awards granted during FY18, the performance target range for growth in FCF per security isbetween 8% and 10% per annum. This is calculated using the FY17 distribution of 51.5 cents per security as thebase and excludes any impact on FCF per security that arises as a result of funding activity that may arise to supportthe execution or delivery of potential major developments.

The target (100%) value of the grant has been estimated based on the award valuations at grant date (a fair valueapproach for the TSR component and a face value approach discounted for distributions/and or dividends for the FCFcomponent). The fair value for TSR considers the probability that the senior executive may not derive value from theLTI award, along with other factors, including difficulty of achieving performance hurdles and anticipated securityprice volatility.
The maximum LTI opportunity for each senior executive is the face value of the award (i.e. the value the seniorexecutive would receive if all their performance awards vested, based on Transurban's security price at the time theaward was granted).
The minimum total value of the grant, if the applicable performance measures are not met, is zero.

Financial close of the Transurban Queensland (‘TQ’) (formerly, Queensland Motorways) acquisition occurred in July2015. The associated capital raising (the issue of 404.5 million new securities) occurred in May 2015. The timing ofthese events (two different financial years) impacted the calculation of the FCF for FY14 and the FCF performancecalculation against the FCF targets for the three LTI plans on foot at that time (the FY12, FY13 and FY14 plans).
Consistent with the treatment of the FY12 LTI plan, as disclosed in the FY14 Remuneration Report, the Boardexercised its discretion to ensure that participants in the FY14 LTI plan were neither advantaged nor disadvantagedas a result of the T0 acquisition and associated capital raising, The Board exercised its discretion to, in effect;exclude the new securities issued from the number of securities used to calculate the FY14 FCF per security for thepurposes of calculating the FCF outcome for the FY14 LTI plan. Interest income on the equity raised prior to financialclose was similarly excluded from the calculation. The targets set at the beginning of the performance period (1 July2012) were not adjusted.

At the 2016 AGM security holders approved an increase in the aggregate fee poolto $3,000,000 (inclusive of superannuation contributions), with effect from 13 October 2016. No change to theaggregate fee pool is proposed for FY18.
Non-executive Director fees for FY11
The Remuneration and Human Resources Committee regularly reviews Non-executive Director fees, and suchreviews include periodic benchmarking against other publicly listed entities of similar size and complexity toTransurban.

During the year ended 30 June 2017, there have been no significant changes in accounting for our assets.
B3 Basis of preparationThe Group financial statements are general purpose ﬁnancial statements which:
- Have been prepared in accordance with the Corporations Act 2001, Australian accounting standards, andother authoritative pronouncements of the Australian Accounting Standards Board;
- Have adopted all accounting policies in accordance with Australian accounting standards, and where astandard permits a choice in accounting policy, the policy adopted by the Group has been disclosed in theseﬁnancial statements;

- The Group reached financial close on 7 July 2017 for a new $1.1 billion syndicated bank debt facility thatrefinances an existing working capital facility, which demonstrates our ability to refinance our debt due in thenext 12 months;

Transurban Holdings LimitedNotes to the consolidated financial statementsfor the year ended 30 June 2017
B3 Basis of preparation (continued)Foreign currency translation
Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing atthe dates of the transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of suchtransactions, and from the translation at year and exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominatedin foreign currencies, are recognised in proﬁt or loss, except when they are deferred in equity as qualifying cashflow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges or are attributable to part of the net investment in a foreignoperation.
Non-monetaw items that are measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange ratesat the date when the fair value was determined Translation differences on assets and liabilities carried at fairvalue are reported as part of the fair value gain or loss, For example, translation differences on non—monetaryassets and liabilities such as equities held at fair value through profit or loss are recognised in profit or loss as partof the fair value gain or loss and translation differences on non-monetary assets such as equities classified asavailable-for—sale ﬁnancial assets are recognised in the fair value reserve in equity
Foreign operations
The results and financial position of all of the Group entities that have a functional currency different from thepresentation currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
- assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the reporting date;
- income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates (unless this is not a reasonable approximationof the cumulative effect of the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and expenses
are translated at the dates of the transactions); and. all resulting exchange differenoes are recognised in other comprehensive income.
0n consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of any net investment in foreign entities, andof borrowings and other financial instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to othercomprehensive income.
New and amended standards
The Group has adopted the following new or revised accounting standards which became effective for the annualreporting period commencing 1 July 2016. The Group determined there is no impact on the financial statementsfrom the adoption.
Reference Description
AASB 2015-1 These amendments clarify various Australian accounting standards.

B3 Basis of preparation (continued)
Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective
Certain new accounting standards and interpretations have been published but are not mandatory for 30 June2017 reporting periods The Group's assessment of the impact of these new standards and interpretations is setout below.
Application of Application
Reference Description and Impact on the Group the standard by the GroupAASB 9 AASB 9 addresses the classification, measurement and 1 January 2018 1 July 2018Financial dereoognition ofﬁnancial assets and financial liabilities. It also
instruments includes an expected loss impairment model and a reformed
approach to hedge accounting The standard will be applicableretrospectively
There will be no impact on the accounting for the Group’sﬁnancial liabilities as the new standard only impacts financialliabilities designated at fair value through profit or loss and theGroup does not have any such liabilities. The Group does nothave any available for sale financial assets.
The Group has not yet completed its assessment of how itshedging arrangements and the impairment of financialinstruments under the expected credit loss model will beaffected by the new rules; however, it does not expect theimpact to be material.
Increased disclosures may be required in the financialstatements. The Group’s assessment of the potentialaccounting, disclosure and financial impacts on adoption of thestandard will continue up to the date of application.
AASB 15 AASB 15 establishes principles for reporting useful information 1 January 2018 1 July 2018Revenue from to users of financial statements about the nature, amount,contracts with timing and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising fromcustomers an entity’s contracts with customers AASB 15 supersedes anumber of current revenue standards.

BS Basis of preparation (continued)
Accounting standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective (continued)
Application of Application
Reference Description and Impact on the Group the standard by the GroupAASB 16 AASB 16 modiﬁes accounting for leases by removing the 1 January 2019 1 July 2019Leases current distinction between operating and financing leases. The
standard requires recognition of an asset and a financial liabilityfor all leases, with exemptions for short term and low valueleases. Under the new standard, entities will no longer berequired to distinguish between ﬁnance leases and operatingleases.
The standard will primarily affect the accounting for the Group’soperating leases. As at the reporting date, the Group has non—canoellable operating lease commitments of $42 million (seenote 826),
On transition and moving forward, for operating leases forwhich payments are currently required to be expensed, theGroup will recognise right of use assets and correspondingliabilities for the principal amount of lease payments, which willthen result in amortisation and interest expenses beingrecognised in the income statement (replacing operating leaseexpenses). Further, the principal component of lease paymentswill be reclassified from operating to financing in the statementof cash flows.
Certain performance metrics and ratios will be impacted as aresult of the above changes, including Proportional EBITDA,Proportional Net Costs and Free Cash, which are measuresused to assess senior executive performance as part of theGroup’s remuneration framework.
The Group is still considering the available options for transitionand has not yet forecasted the financial impacts of the newsmndard, but will do so leading up to application of thestandard.
AASB 2016-1 Amendment to AASB 112 clarifies the accounting for deferred 1 January 2017 1 July 2017tax where an asset is measured at fair value and that fair valueis below the asset's tax base This does not change theunderlying principles for the recognition of deferred tax assets.
The Group does not have any temporary taxable or deductibledifferences on assets that are measured at fair value. Thereforethe impact of the application of the new standard is notexpected to be material.
AASB 2016-2 Amendment to AASB 107 introduces additional disclosures that 1 January 2017 1 July 2017will enable users of financial statements to evaluate changes inliabilities arising from financing activities.
The impact of the application of the new skandard will beadditional disclosure in the Group financial statements relatingto the financial liabilities held by the Group.

Accounting policy
The income tax expense/benefit for the period is the tax payable or beneﬁt on the current period's taxable incomebased on the applicable income tax rate for each jurisdiction, adjusted by changes in deferred tax assets andliabilities attributable to temporary differences and to unused tax losses
The current income tax expense is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at theend of the reporting period in the countries where the Company operates and generates taxable income.Management periodically evaluates positions taken in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable taxregulation is subject to interpretation It establishes provisions where appropriate on the basis of amountsexpected to be paid to the tax authorities.
The Transurban stapled group comprises two corporate entities (THL and TIL) and a trust (THT). THT operatesas a flow-through trust, and is not liable to pay tax itself. Instead, security holders pay tax on the distributions theyreceive from the trust at their individual marginal tax rates, The Group is structured in this way because the initialheavy capital investment and associated debt funding required for infrastructure investments results in accountinglosses being generated in the initial years which would otherwise prevent a company from paying dividends. Thetrust enables distributions to be made to security holders throughout the life of the asset.
Deferred income tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between thetax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However,deferred income tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition ofan assetor liability in atransaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nortaxable profit or loss Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted orsubstantially enacted by the reporting date and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax assetis realised or the deferred income tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are reoognised for deductible temporary differences and unused tax losses only if it isprobable that future taxable amounts will be available to utilise those temporary differences and losses,
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised for temporary differences between the carrying amount andtax bases of investments in foreign operations where the Company is able to control the timing of the reversal ofthe temporary differences and it is probable that the differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assetsand liabilities and when the deferred tax balances relate to the same taxation authority. Current tax assets and taxliabilities are offset where the entity has a legally enforceable right to offset and intends either to settle on a netbasis, or to realise the asset and settle the liability simultaneously.
Current and deferred tax is recognised in profit or loss, except to the extent that it relates to items recognised inother comprehensive income or directly in equity.Investment allowances
Companies within the Group may be entitled to claim special tax deductions for investments in qualifying assets(investment allowances). The Group accounts for such allowances as tax credits, which means that the allowancereduces income tax payable and current tax expense. A deferred tax asset is recognised for unclaimed tax creditsthat are carried forward as tax losses.
Tax consolidation legislation
The Transurban Group has adopted the Australian mx consolidation legislation for THL and its wholly-ownedAustralian entities from 1 July 2005.
All entities within the Australian tax consolidated groups continue to account for their own current and deferred taxamounts. These tax amounts are measured as if each entity in the tax consolidation group is a separate taxpayerwithin the tax consolidated group.

Transurban DRIVe tax consolidated group
Transurban DRIVe Holdings LLC (‘TDH’) is the head company of the DRIVe tax consolidated group. The DRIVetax consolidated group is consolidated for US tax purposes in the sense that the 100% subsidiaries of TDH haveelected to be treated as disregarded entities for US tax purposes This treatment means that those entities areignored for US m purposes and that TDH, as head entity, carries any tax liability or beneﬁts arising in the group.The DRIVe tax consolidated group currently owns partnership interests in both 495 Express Lanes and 95Express Lanes and includes its share of each asset's profits or losses in its US tax return.
Goods and Services Tax (‘GST’)
Revenues, expenses and assets are recognised net of the amount of associated GST, unless the GST incurred isnot recoverable from the taxation authority. In this case it is recognised as part of the cost of acquisition of theasset or as part of the expense.
Receivables and payables are stated inclusive of the amount of GST receivable or payable. The net amount ofGST recoverable from, or payable to, the taxation authority is included with other receivables or payables in thebalance sheet.
Cash flows are presented on a gross basis. The GST components of cash flows arising from investing orfinancing activities which are recoverable from, or payable to the taxation authority, are presented as operatingcash flows,
Key estimate
The Group is subject to income taxes in Australia and the USA. Signiﬁcant judgement is required indetermining the provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations undertaken duringthe ordinary course of business for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognisesliabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on whether additional mxes will be due, Where the final taxoutcome of these matters is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impactthe current and deferred tax assets and liabilities in the period in which such determination is made.
The Group has recognised deferred tax assets relating to carried forward tax losses to the extent there aresufficient taxable temporary differences relating to the same taxation authority against which the unused taxlosses can be utilised. However, the utilisation of tax losses also depends on the ability of the Group to satisfycertain tests at the time the losses are recouped. In the USA tax losses generally expire after a 20 year periodManagement has reviewed the potential future taxable profits and has recognised deferred tax assets inrelation to tax losses.

Cash and cash equivalents
For the purpose of presentation in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash and cash equivalents includescash on hand, deposits held at call with financial institutions, other short-term, highly liquid investments withoriginal maturities of three months or less that are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which aresubject to an insigniﬁcant risk of changes in value, and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown withinborrowings in current liabilities: All cash balances are interest bearing.
The amount shown in cash and cash equivalents includes $223 million not available for general use at 30 June2017 (2016: $376 million) of which $132 million (2016: $209 million) belongs to TIL. This comprises amountsrequired to be held under maintenance and funding reserves and prepaid tolls, which are not available for generalUSE.
Current held to maturity investments as shown in the table above are short term investments in governmenttreasuries that are due to mature within 12 months, which management intends to hold to maturity.
Trade and other receivables
Loans and receivables are non—derivative ﬁnancial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quotedin an active market. They are included in current assets, except for those with maturities greater than 12 monthsafter the reporting date which are classified as non-current assets, Trade receivables are recognised initially atfair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less allowance forimpairment. Trade receivables are due for settlement no more than 30 days from revenue recognition.
Collectability of trade receivables is reviewed on an ongoing basis. Debts which are known to be unrecoverableare written off by reducing the carrying amount of trade debtors directly. An allowance for impairment is usedwhen there is evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms ofthe receivables. The amount of the allowance for impairment is the difference between the carrying amount andthe amount expected to be recoverable. The additional amount of the allowance for doubtful debtors is recognisedin profit or loss.
As at 30 June 2017, the Group held an allowance for doubtful debtors of $2 million (2016: $2 million), recognisedfor current trade receivables that were considered potentially unrecoverable: As at 30 June 2017, tradereceivables of $26 million (2016: $20 million) were overdue but the Group still believes that these overdueamounts will be received in full. The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain amounts thatare considered to be potentially unrecoverable
The carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value.

Accounting policy
Borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequentlymeasured at amortised cost. Any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemptionamount is recognised in profit or loss over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest methcdt Feespaid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it isprobable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is deferred until the draw downoccurs. To the extent there is no evidence that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, thefee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and amortised overthe period of the facility to which itrelates.
Borrowings are removed from the balance sheet when the obligation specified in the contract is discharged,cancelled or expired. The difference between the carrying amount of a financial liability that has beenextinguished or transferred to another party and the consideration paid, including any ncn-cash assets transferredor liabilities assumed, is recognised in profit or loss as finance income or finance costs. Borrowings are classifiedas current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12months after the reporting period.
Borrowing costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which they are incurred, except to the extent towhich they relate to the construction of qualifying assets in which case specifically identifiable borrowing costs arecapitalised into the cost of the asset, Borrowing costs include interest on short-term and Iong-term borrowings.
Costs incurred in connection with the arrangement of borrowings are capitalised and amortised over the effectiveperiod of the funding.

B15 Derivatives and financial risk management (continued)
Accounting policy
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and aresubsequently remeasured to their fair value at the end of each reporting period. The accounting for subsequentchanges in fair value depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, thenature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivatives as either:
- hedges of the fair value of recognised assets or liabilities or a firm commitment (fair value hedges);
- hedges of a particular risk associated with the cash ﬂows of recognised assets and liabilities and highlyprobable forecast transactions (cash flow hedges); or
. hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation (net investment hedges).
At the inception of the hedging transaction the Group documents the relationship between hedging instrumentsand hedged items, as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedgetransactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge inception and on an ongoing basis, ofwhether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions have been and will continue to be highly effective inoffsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items.
The fair values of various derivative ﬁnancial instruments used for hedging purposes are disclosed in this note.Movements in the cash flow hedging reserve in shareholders‘ equity are shown in note B12. The full fair value ofahedging derivative is classiﬁed as a non-current asset or liability when the remaining maturity of the hedged itemis more than 12 months
Fair value hedges
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recorded in profitor loss, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to thehedged risk. The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest rate swaps and cross currency swapshedging fixed rate borrowings is recognised in profit or loss within finance costs, together with changes in the fairvalue of the hedged fixed rate borrowings attributable to interest rate risk. The gain or loss relating to theineffective portion is recognised in profit or loss.
If the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting. the adjustment to the carrying amount of a hedgeditem for which the effective interest method is used is amortised to profit or loss over the period to maturity using arecalculated effective interest rate.
Cash ﬂow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flowhedges is recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity‘ The gain or lossrelating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss,
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassified to proﬁt or loss in the periods when the hedged item affects profitor loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold or terminated, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria forhedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognisedwhen the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longerexpected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to profit orloss.
Net investment hedgesHedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges.
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in othercomprehensive income and accumulated in reserves in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portionis recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in profit or loss when the foreign operation is partiallydisposed of or sold.
Derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting
Certain derivative instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting Changes in the fair value of any derivativeinstrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in profit or loss

B15 Derivatives and financial risk management (continued)
Hedging strategy and instruments used by the Group
The Group uses derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business in order to hedge exposures tofluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates in accordance with the Group's financial riskmanagement policies The Group’s policies allow derivative transactions to be undertaken for the purpose ofreducing risk and do not permit speculative trading. The instruments used by the Group are as follows:
Interest rate swap contracts — cash flow hedges
The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage the Group's exposure to variable interest rates related toborrowings. Interest rate swap contracts currently in place cover 98% (2016: 100%) of the variable debt held bythe Group (excluding working capital facilities)‘
Forward exchange contracts — cash ﬂow hedges
The Group currently uses forward exchange contracts to protect against exchange rate movements between theAUD and foreign currencies. The Group has hedged a portion of its USD interest commitments and its capitalexpenditure commitments.
Cross-currency interest rate contracts — cash ﬂow hedges
The Group has entered into cross-currency interest rate swap contracts to remove the risk of unfavourableexchange rate movements on borrowings held in foreign currencies. Under these contracts, the Group receivesforeign currency at fixed rates and pays AUD at either fixed or floating rates. The Group then uses the interestrate swap contracts to hedge the floating interest rate commitments back to fixed interest rates,
offsetting financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities
Currently there is no right or basis to present any financial assets or ﬁnancial liabilities on a net basis, and as suchno financial assets or financial liabilities have been presented on a net basis in the Group's balance sheet at theend of the financial year.
Hedge of net investment in foreign entity
Transurban's investment in its US based assets (495 Express Lanes and 95 Express Lanes) acts as a naturalhedge against the exposure to foreign currency movements for a portion of the Group’s USD denominatedborrowings. Exchange differences arising on the revaluation of these USD denominated borrowings arerecognised in profit or loss in the separate financial statements of Transurban Finance Company Pty Limited. Inthe Group financial statements these exchange differences are recognised in the foreign currency translationreserve in equity and will be transferred to profit or loss when the Group disposes its interest in the US basedassets. As at 30 June 2017, the Group has deferred $43 million in losses (2016: $94 million losses).
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk and interest raterisk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The financial risk managementfunction is carried out centrally under the policiesapproved by the Board. The Group reviews operations actively to identify and monitor all financial risks and tomitigate these risks through the use of hedging instruments where appropriate The Board is informed on aregular basis of any material exposures to ﬁnancial risks.
The Group continuously monitors risk exposures over time through review of cash flows, price movements,market analysis and ongoing communication within the Group‘ When measuring financial risk, the Groupconsiders positive and negative exposures, existing hedges and the ability to offset exposures where possible,

Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk when future transactions andrecognised assets and liabilities are denominated in a currency that is not the entity’s functional currency.
Foreign currency exposures are viewed as either investment exposures or operating exposures. Exposures frominvestments in foreign assets are generally managed using foreign currency debt. All known material operatingexposures out to 12 months are hedged, either using hedging instruments, or are offset by drawing on foreigncurrency funds.
Exposure to foreign currency risk at the reporting date, denominated in the currency in which the risk arises, wasas follows:

The Group revalues its foreign currency denominated borrowings each period using market spot rates and, wherethese borrowings have been appropriately hedged, defers these movements in the cash flow hedge reserve inequity. The volatility in the cash ﬂow hedge reserve is caused mainly by fair value movements of the crosscurrency interest rate swaps, which are affected by changes in forward Australian dollar/foreign currencyexchange rates.

Accounting for assets — changes during the year
During the year ended 30 June 2017, there have been no significant changes in the accounting for our assets.Group financial performance
Financial performance indicators
The Transurban Board and management assess the performance of the networks in which we operate based ona measure of proportional earnings before depreciation, amortisation, netﬁnanoe costs and income taxes(‘Proportional EBITDA’) excluding the impact of signiﬁcant items (‘Underlying proportional EBITDA'). This reflectsthe contribution of each network in the Group in the proportion of Transurban's equity ownership,
Significant items are those items where their nature and amount is considered material to the financialstatements and not in the ordinary course of business.
To arrive at the proportional result, minority interests in Transurban's controlled roads are taken out andTransurban's interests in non-controlled assets are included, in proportion to Transurban’s ownership.
Free cash is the primary measure used to assess Transurban’s cash generation. Free cash is used as the guideto determine distributions to security holders

Interest rate risk
The Group's main exposure to interest rate risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, and Iong-term borrowings.The Group manages interest rate risk by entering into fixed rate debt facilities or by using interest rate swaps toconvert floating rate debt to fixed interest rates. Generally, the Group raises long term borrowings at floatinginterest rates and swaps them into fixed interest rates that are lower than those available if the Group borrowed atfixed rates directly The Group‘s policy is to hedge interest rate exposure at a minimum in compliance with thecovenant requirements of funding facilities and up to 100%. Covenant requirements vary by debt facility, andrequire a minimum of between 50% and 80% of the interest rate exposure to be hedged. At 30 June 2017, 97%(2016: 99%) of the Group’s interest rate exposure on variable rate borrowings was hedged.
As at the reporting date, the Group had the following cash balances, variable rate borrowings and interest rateswap contracts outstanding:

Credit risk
The Group has no significant concentrations of credit risk from operating activities, and has policies in place toensure that transactions are made with commercial customers with an appropriate credit history‘ However, as anoperator of large infrastructure assets, the Group is exposed to credit risk with its financial counterparties throughentering into financial transactions through the ordinary course of business. These include funds held on deposit,cash investments and the market value ofderivative transactions.
The Group assesses the credit strength of potential financial oounterparties using objective ratings provided bymultiple independent rating agencies‘ The Board approved policies ensure that higher limits are granted to higherrated counterparties. The Group also seeks to mitigate its total credit exposure to counterparties by only dealingwith credit worthy counterparties, limiting the exposure to any one oounterparty, minimising the size of theexposure where possible through netting offsetting exposures, diversifying exposures across counterparties,closely monitoring changes in total credit exposures and changes in credit status, and taking mitigating actionwhen necessary.
Liquidity risk
The Group maintains sufficient cash and undrawn facilities to maintain short term flexibility and enable the Groupto meetfinancial commitments in a timely manner. The Group assesses liquidity over the short term (up to 12months) and medium term (one to five years) by maintaining accurate forecasts of operating expenses,committed capital expenditure and payments to security holders. Long term liquidity requirements are reviewed aspart of the annual strategic planning process‘
Short term liquidity is managed by maintaining a strategic liquidity reserve. This reserve is based on the Group'sforecast annual operating costs and certain risk exposure scenarios as maintained by the Group’s strategic riskregister, and is maintained as cash and undrawn facilities. The reserve is maintained on a rolling 12 month basis.Medium term liquidity forecasting is maintained on a rolling five year horizon.

Fair value measurements
The carrying value of the Group's ﬁnancial assets and liabilities approximate fair value. This is also generally thecase with borrowings since either the interest payable on those borrowings is close to current market rates or theborrowings are of a short-term nature. The fair values of non-current borrowings are determined based ondiscounted cash flows using a current borrowing rate. They are classified as level 2 fair values in the fair value
hierarchy due to the use of observable inputs.
Fair value is categorised within the fair value hierarchy based on the lowest level of input that is significant to thefair value measurement as a whole:
- Level 1 —quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities
- Level 2 — inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability,either directly (as prices) or indirectly (derived from prices)
. Level 3 — inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All of the Group's financial instruments measured, recognised and disclosed at fair value were valued usingmarket observable inputs (Level 2). There were no transfers between levels during the period and there has beenno change in the valuation techniques applied.
Key estimateThe fair value of financial instruments that are not traded in an active market (for example, over—the-counter
derivatives) is determined using valuation techniques. The Group uses its judgement to select a variety ofmethods and makes assumptions that are mainly based on market conditions existing at each reporting date.The fair value of both cross-currency interest rate swaps and interest rate swaps is calculated as the presentvalue of the estimated future cash ﬂows. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is determined usingforward exchange market rates at the end of the reporting period.

Concession assets
Concession assets represent the Group's rights to operate roads under Service Concession Arrangements. Allconcession assets are classified as intangible assets and are amortised on a straight line basis over the term ofthe right to operate the asset
Transurban has the right to tell the concession assets for the concession period. Extensions to the concessionperiod have been granted during the period for a number of individual concessions as a result of roaddevelopment projects and improvements. At the end of the concession period, all concession assets are returnedto the respective Government. The remaining terms of the right to operate are reflected below:

B16 Intangible assets (continued)Impairment testing of goodwill and other intangible assets
At each reporting date, the Group assesses whether there is any indication that an asset may be impaired. Wherean indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes an estimate of the recoverable amount. Goodwill is tested forimpairment on an annual basis, regardless of whether an indicator of impairment exists.
Recoverable amount is the greater of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purpose of assessingimpairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows whichare largely independent of the cash inflows from other assets or groups ofassets (cash-generating units).
Where the carrying amount of an intangible asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is consideredimpaired and is written down to its recoverable amount through profit or loss. The decrement in the carryingamount is recognized as an expense in profit or loss in the reporting period in which the impairment occurs.
The recoverable amount of the Group's cash generating units have been determined based on value-in-usecalculations.
The following table sets out the key assumptions on which management has based its cash flow projections. Thecalculations use 3 year cash flow projections based on financial budgets reviewed by the Board. Cash flowsbeyond this period are modelled using a consistent set of Iong-term assumptions up 'to the end of the applicableconcession period:





Melbourne Sydney Brisbane GWA2016 , 2016 Q 2016 , 2016Long term CPI (% annual growth) 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.5% 2.7% 2.7% 2.5% 2.5%nggwtﬁ;m average weekly earnings (% annual 3.5% 40% 35% 4.0% 35% 40% 33% 3.0%Pre-tax discount rate (%) 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2% 8.2%
Management has determined the values assigned to each of the above key assumptions as follows:

Assumption Approach used to determine values
Trafﬁc volume Based on historical trends and the Group's long term traffic forecastingmodels
Long term CPI (% annual growth) Based on independent external forecasts
Long term average weekly earnings Based on independent external forecasts
(% annual growth)
Pre-tax discount rate Discount rates consider specific risks relating to the CGU, In
performing the value-in-use calculations for each CGU, the Group hasapplied post-tax discount rates to discount the forecast futureattributable post tax cash flows. The equivalent pre-tax discount ratesare disclosed in the table above.
Key estimate
The Group makes certain assumptions in calculating the recoverable amount of its goodwill and otherintangible assets, These include assumptions around expected traffic flows and forecast operational costs.In performing the value-in—use calculation, the Group has applied the assumptions noted in the above table.Management does not consider that any reasonable possible change in the assumptions will result in thecarrying value of a CGU exceeding its recoverable amount.

Group structure
B19 Principles of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are fully consolidated from the date the Group gains control of the subsidiary and are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases‘
In preparing the consolidated financial statements of the Group, all inter—entity transactions and balances havebeen eliminated. The accounting policies adopted by the individual entities comprising the Group are consistentwith the parent company.
Non-controlling interests consist of two components:
. Non-oontrolling interest— other: external non-controlling interests relating to Transurban Queensland andEastern Distributor in the results and equity of subsidiaries are shown separately in the Group financialstatements.
- Non-oontrolling interests that relate to THT and TIL are presented separately, but relate to equityholders of the stapled group.
Associates and joint ventu res
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant inﬂuence but not control and relate to the Group’sinvestments in Interlink M5 and the NorthWestern Roads Group (which holds the Westlink M7 and NcrthConnexassets)
The Group‘s share of the post-acquisition profits or losses in associates is recognised in profit or loss and itsshare of post-acquisition movements in reserves is recognised in other comprehensive income. These post—acquisition movements are adjusted against the carrying amount of the investment. When the Group’s cumulativeshare of losses in an associate exceeds its investment in the asset, the Group does not recognise any furtherlosses from this point Dividends received from the assets listed above reduce the carrying amount of theinvestment.
Changes in ownership interest
The Group treats transactions with non—controlling interests that do not result in a loss of control, as transactionswith equity owners of the Group. A change in ownership interest results in an adjustment between the carryingamounts of the controlling and non-controlling interests to reflect their relative interests in the subsidiary, Anydifference between the amount of the adjustment to non-controlling interests and any consideration paid orreceived is recognised in a separate reserve within equity,

321 Business combinations
Accounting policy
Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration transferred for theacquisition of a subsidiary comprises the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and the equityinterests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred also includes the fair value of any contingentconsideration arrangement and the fair value of any pre-existing equity interest in the subsidiary. Acquis’ ion-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilitiesassumed in a business combination are, with limited exceptions, measured initially at their fair values at theacquisition date‘ On an acquisition-by—acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in theacquiree either at fair value or at the non-controlling interest's proportionate share of the acquiree's net identifiableassets
The excess of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non~contro||ing interest in the acquiree and theacquisition-date fair value of any previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group's share ofthe net identifiable assets acquired is recorded as goodwill, If those amounts are less than the fair value of the netidentifiable assets of the subsidiary acquired and the measurement of all amounts has been reviewed, thedifference is recognised directly in profit or loss as a bargain purchase.
Where settlement of any part of cash consideration is deferred, the amounts payable in the future are discountedto their present value as at the date of exchange. The discount rate used is the entity's incremental borrowingrate, being the rate at which a similar borrowing could be obtained from an independent financier undercomparable terms and conditions.
Contingent consideration is classified either as equity or a financial liability. Amounts classified as a financialliability are subsequently remeasured to fair value with changes in fair value recognised in profit or loss

' $77 million increase in non-100% owned assets distributions received due to higher distributions from M5 ($29million) associated with the timing of payment of FY16 distributions, Transurban Queensland (excludingAirportlinkM7) ($15 million), Eastern Distributor ($11 million) and NorthWestern Roads Group distributions($22 million)
- $38 million increase due to distributions received from AirportlinkM7' $174 million increase from the NorthWestern Roads Group capital release. $4 million increase due to favourable year—cn-year movements in working capital and maintenance expense
The weighted average securities eligible for distribution have increased due to the impact of the equity issued inDecember 2015 to support the acquisition of AirportlinkM7. These securities issued in December 2015 wereeligible for the FY16 2d half distributions only, but were entitled to both distributions in FY17.
