Key Audit Matters (Continued)Accounting for reverse acquisition
As disclosed in Note 2, the Company completed its acquisition of the entire share capital of Sky Win Management Consultancy Pte Ltd andits subsidiaries (collectively, the “Sky Win Group) (the “Reverse Acquisition) on 24 January 2017, via the issuance of 1,187,692,308 newordinary shares in the Company to the shareholders of the Sky Win Group. The transaction is treated as a reverse acquisition for accountingpurposes as the shareholders of the Sky Win Group became the controlling shareholders of the Company upon completion of the transaction,Accordingly, the Sky Win Group (being the legal subsidiary in the transaction) is regarded as the accounting acquirer, and the Company (beingthe legal parent in the transaction) is regarded as the accounting acquiree.
We focused on this transaction because of the judgement involved in identifying the acquiree and acquirer for accounting purposes, themateriality of the transaction and the complexity of the accounting and disclosures, in the following areas:
7 The recognition of acquisition costs of RM77.8 million in the current period’s profit or loss, and the quantification of consideration paidto the Company's shareholders by the Sky Win Group; and
, The disclosure of the Reverse Acquisition in financial statements is not common. The equity and comparative numbers in the consolidatedfinancial statements relate to the Sky Win Group, whereas the legal shareholding relates to the Company.
In auditing the Reverse Acquisition, we obtained the signed contract and read significant contract terms relevant to the accounting anddisclosures in the financial statements. We assessed management’s basis to treat the transaction as a reverse acquisition. We evaluated themethodology and checked the mathematical accuracy of the calculations of the deemed consideration of RM77.8 million deemed paid to theCompany’s shareholders. We compared the underlying information inputs, including the share prices, exchange ratios and foreign exchangerates with independent data sources. We also evaluated whether the Group's disclosures in respect of the Reverse Acquisition were reasonableand reflected the transaction terms.
Acceunting far development pruperties under construction
The Group is involved in the construction of development properties for which it applies the percentage of completion method, The revenueand profit recognised in a year on these projects is dependent, amongst others, on the surveys of work performed for each project for theassessment of the percentage of completion of these projects and the total budgeted cost estimated for the project. The uncertainty andsubjectivity involved in determining the budgeted cost to complete will also have a significant impact on the results of the Group. Accordingly,we identiﬁed this as a key audit matter.
As part of our audit, we reviewed contract terms and conditions and the contractual sums and substantiated project revenues and costs incurredagainst the underlying documents. We assessed management's assumptions in determining the percentage of completion of the projects andthe total budgeted cost estimated for the protect. We evaluated the appropriateness of inputs used by management in their estimation of thetotal cost to complete and obtained supporting documentation on the major inputs. We also checked the arithmetic accuracy of the revenue andprofit recognised based on the percentage of completion computation for individually signiﬁcant projects. We perused correspondences withcontractors and discussed the progress of the protects with the Group's various project officials and management for any potential disputes,variation order claims, known technical issues or significant events that could impact the estimated development costs. We also evaluated theadequacy of the disclosure of significant accounting policles for development properties under construction and related disclosures in Notes3.14 and 14.

Key Audit Matters (Continued)Carrying value of development properties held for sale
The Group has significant mixed deveiopment properties held for sale in Malaysia. Development properties held for sale are stated at the lowerof cost and net realisable vaiue. The estimation of the net realisable value of these development properties is dependent upon the Group’sexpectations of future selling prices. We identified this as a key audit matter as there is a risk that the estimates of net realisable values mayexceed future selling prices, resulting in iosses when properties are sold.
We evaluated the reasonableness of the Group’s forecast selling prices by comparing it to recently transacted prices or prices of comparableproperties located in the same vicinity as the deveiopment project, We focused on development projects with slower-than-expected saies orwith lower profit margins. For projects which are expected to sell below cost, we checked the computations of the allowance to write downcarrying value to estimated net realisable value. We also evaluated the adequacy of the disclosures in Note 14 in respect of the allowance forforeseeable losses presented in the financial statements for these development properties.
Hecaverabi/ity of trade receivablesTrade receivables are significant to the Group as they represent 9.2% of the Group’s assets.
The collectability of trade receivables is a key element of the Group‘s working capital management, which is managed on an ongoing basis bymanagement. The determination as to whether a trade receivable is collectible involves management judgment. Specific factors managementconsiders include the age of the baiances, existence of disputes, recent historical payments and any other available information concerningthe creditworthiness of customers, Management uses the information to assist in their judgement to determine whether aliowance for doubtfuldebts is required. As such, we determined that this is a key audit matter.
Our audit procedures included, amongst others, obtaining an understanding of the Group‘s processes and related controls on the monitoringof the collectability of trade receivables as well as considering the aging profile of outstanding trade receivables to identity collection risks. Weindependently confirmed trade receivable balances with major debtors and assessed their collectability by obtaining evidence of subsequentreceipts. We also assessed the key assumptions used by management to evaluate the Group's trade receivables for impairment and theestimation of the impairment amount, where applicable, through analysis of age of outstanding receivables, assessment of significant overdueindividual trade receivables and specific customer profile and risks.
Information regarding the Group's trade receivabies and its credit risk management process is disclosed in Notes 15 and 27(a) respectivelyto the financial statements

— Conclude on the appropriateness of management’s use of the going concern basis of accounting and, based on the audit evidenceobtained, whether a material uncertainty exists related to events or conditions that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability tocontinue as a going concern. If we conclude that a material uncertainty exists, we are required to draw attention in our auditor‘s reportto the related disclosures in the financial statements or, if such disclosures are inadequate, to modify our opinion. Our conclusionsare based on the audit evidence obtained up to the date of our auditor’s report. However, future events or conditions may cause theGroup to cease to continue as a going concern.
— Evaluate the overall presentation, structure and content of the ﬁnancial statements, including the disclosures, and whether the financialstatements represent the underlying transactions and events in a manner that achieves fair presentation.
— Obtain sufﬁcient appropriate audit evidence regarding the ﬁnancial information of the entities or business activities within the Groupto express an opinion on the consolidated financial statements, We are responsible for the direction, supervision and performance ofthe group audit.

Standards issued but not yet effective (Continued)
Except for FRS 109 and FRS 116, the directors expect that the adoption of the other standards above will have no materialimpact on the financial statements in the period of initial application. The nature of the impending changes in accounting policyon adoption of FRS 109 and FRS 116 are disclosed below.
FRS 109 Financial Instruments
FRS 109 introduces new requirements for classification and measurement of financial assets, impairment of ﬁnancial assetsand hedge accounting, Financial assets are classified according to their contractual cash flow characteristics and the businessmodel under which they are held. The impairment requirements in FRS 109 are based on an expected credit loss model andreplace the FRS 39 incurred loss model,
FRS 109 requires the Group to record expected credit losses on all of its debt securities, loans and trade receivables, eitheron a 12-month 0r lifetime basis, The Group expects to apply the simplified approach and record lifetime expected losses onall trade receivables. Upon application of the expected credit loss model, the Group expects a significant impact on its equitydue to unsecured nature of its loans and receivables, but will need to perform a more detailed analysis which considers allreasonable and supportable information, including forward-looking elements to determine the extent of impact,
FRS 116 Leases
FRS 116 requires lessees to recognise most leases on statement of financial position to reflect the rights to use the leasedassets and the associated obligations for lease payments as well as the corresponding interest expense and depreciationcharges.

Business combinations involving entities under common control
Business combinations involving entities under common control are accounted for by applying the peeling of interestmethod which involves the following:
— The assets and liabiiities of the combining entities are reﬂected at their carrying amounts reported in theeonsoiidated financial statements of the controlling holding company‘
— No adjustments are made to reflect the fair values on the date of combination, or recognise any new assetsor liabilities,
— No additional goodwill is recognised as a result of the combination.
7 Any difference between the consideration paid/transterred and the equity ‘acquired' is reflected within theequity as merger reserve.
7 The statement of comprehensive income reflects the results of the combining entities for the fuil year,irrespective of when the combination took place.
Comparatives are restated to reflect the combination as if it had occurred from the beginning of the earliest periodpresented in the financial statements or from the date the entities had come under common control, it later.
Acquisition at an asset or a group of assets that does not constitute a business
At the time of acquisition, the Group considers whether each acquisition represents the acquisition of a business orthe acquisition of an asset. Where the assets acquired and liabilities assumed do not constitute a business as definedunder FRS 103, the transaction is accounted for as an asset acquisition.
in such cases, the Group identifies and recognises the individual identifiable assets acquired (inciuding intangibleassets) and iiabilities assumed. The cost of the acquisition is allocated to the individual identifiabie assets and liabilitiesbased upon their relative fair values at the date of purchase, and n0 goodwill or deferred tax is recognised.
Foreign currency
The functional currency of the Company is Ringgit Malaysia (“RM) as it reflects the primary economic environment which theentity operates, Each entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items included in the financial statementsof each entity are measured ustng that functional currency,

Transactions in foreign currencies are measured in the respective functional currencies of the Company and itssubsidiaries and are recorded on initial recognition in the functional currencies at exchange rates approximatingthose ruling at the transaction dates. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translatedat the rate of exchange ruling at the end of the reporting period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms ofhistorical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions,Nonemonetary items measured at fair value in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates at the datewhen the fair value was measured.
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at the end of thereporting period are recognised in profit or loss.
(b) Translation
For consoiidation purpose, the assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated into RM at the rate ofexchange ruiing at the end of each of the reporting periods and their profit or loss are translated at the exchange ratesprevailing at the date of the transactions. The exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in othercomprehensive income, On disposal of a foreign operation, the component of other comprehensive income relating tothat particuiar foreign operation is recognised in profit or loss.
3.6 Revenue recognition
The Group adopts FRS 115 in the preparation of its ﬁnancial statements, and applies the following accounting poiicy forrevenue recognition:
(a) Sale of development properties held for saleThe Group recognises revenue from contracts with customers based on a five-step model as set out in FRS 115:
— Step 1. Identify contractis) with a customer: A contract is defined as an agreement between two or moreparties that creates enforceable rights and obligations and sets out the criteria for every contract that mustbe met.
— Step 2. Identify performance obligations in the contract: A performance obligation is a promise in a contractWith a customer to transfer a good or service to the customer.
— Step 3. Determine the transaction price: The transaction price is the amount of consideration to which theGroup expects to be entitled in exchange for transferring promised goods or services to a customer, excludingamounts coilected on behalf of third parties.
7 Step 4. Allocate the transaction price to the performance obligations in the contract: For a contract that hasmore than one performance obligation, the Group allocates the transaction price to each performance obligationin an amount that depicts the amount of consideration to which the Group expects to be entitied in exchangefor satisfying each performance obligation.

Sale of development properties held for sale (Continued)
— Step 5. Recognise revenue when (or as) the Group satisfies a performance on igation. The Group satisfies aperformance obligation and recognises revenue over time, it one of the following criteria is met:
(a) The Group’s performance does not create an asset with an alternate use to the Group and the Grouphas an enforceable right to payment for performance completed to da e.
(b) The Group’s performance creates or enhances an asset that the cus omer controls as the asset iscreated or enhanced.
(c) The customer simuitaneously receives and consumes the benefits provic ed by the Group‘s performanceas the Group performs.
For sale of development properties held for sale. revenue is recognised based on the percentage-ot—compietion method.Under the percentage-of-completion method, profit is brought to profit or loss only in resaect of finaiised saies contractsand t0 the extent that such profit relates to the progress of construction work. The progress of construction work ismeasured by the proportion of the construction and related costs incurred to date to t e estimated totai constructionand related costs for each project,

For performance obligations where one of the above conditions are not met, revenue is recognised at the point in timeat which the performance obiigation is satisfied.
When the Group satisfies a performance obligation by delivering the promised goods or services, it creates a contractbased asset 0n the amount of consideration earned by the performance, Where the amount of consideration receivedfrom a customer exceeds the amount of revenue recognised this gives rise to a contract liability,
Revenue iS measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable, taking into account contractuallydefined terms of payment and excluding taxes and duty. The Group assesses its revenue arrangements against specificcriteria to determine if it is acting as principal or agent.
Revenue is recognised to the extent it is probable that the economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenueand costs, if appiicable, can be measured reliably.
Rental income
Rental income arising from operating teases is accounted for on a straighteline basis over the lease terms. Theaggregate costs of incentives provided to lessees are recognised as a reduction of rental income over the lease termon a straight-iine basis.
Interest income

Where a sale-and-leaseback transaction results in an operating lease, and it is clear that the transaction is establishedat fair value, any profit or ioss shall be recognised immediately. It the sale price is below fair vaiue, any profit or lossshali be recognised immediately except that. if the loss is compensated for by future lease payments by the Group atbelow market price, it shali be deferred and amortised in proportion to the lease payments over the period for whichthe asset is expected to be used. If the sale price is above fair value, the excess over fair value shali be deferred andamortised over the period for which the asset is expected to be used.
(b) As lessor
Leases in which the Group does not transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset areclassified as operating ieases. Initiai direct costs incurred in negotiating an operating lease are added to the carryingamount of the ieased asset and recognised over the lease term on the same bases as rental income.

Subsidiaries
A subsidiary is an investee that is controlied by the Group, The Group controls an investee when it is exposed. or has rights,to variable returns from its invoivement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power overthe investee,
In the Company's separate tinanciai statements, investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less impairment losses,Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. It any indication exists,or when an annual impairment testing for an asset is required, the Group makes an estimate of the asset's recoverable amount.
An asset’s recoverabie amount is the higher of an assets or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs of disposai andits value in use and is determined for an individual asset, unless the asset does not generate cash intiows that are largelyindependent of those from other assets or group of assets. Where the carrying amount of an asset or cashrgenerating unitexceeds its recoverabie amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its recoverabie amount. Impairmentlosses are recognised in profit or ioss,
A previously recognised impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in the estimates used to determine theassets recoverable amount Since the last impairment loss was recognised. If that is the case, the carrying amount of the assetis increased to its recoverable amount. That increase cannot exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined,net of depreciation, had no impairment loss been recognised previously. Such reversal is recognised in profit or loss.
Development properties
Development properties are properties acquired or being constructed for sale in the ordinary course of busmess, rather thanto be held for the Group’s own use, rentai or capital appreciation.
Completed development property/deveiopment properties under construction (unsold units)
Completed deveiopment property/development properties under construction (unsold units) are held as inventories and aremeasured at the lower of cost and net realisable value,
Net realisable vaiue is the estimated seliing price in the ordinary course of business, based on market prices at the reportingdate and discounted for the time value of money if material, less the estimated costs of completion and the estimated costsnecessary to make the saie.
The costs of development properties recognised in profit or loss on disposal are determined with reference to the speCificcosts incurred on the property sold and an allocation of any non-specitic costs based on the relative size of the property soid.

Impairment of financial assets (Continued)The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that a financial asset is impaired,
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the Group first assesses whether objective evidence of impairment existsindividually for ﬁnancial assets that are individually signiﬁcant, or collectively for financial assets that are not individuallysignificant. It the Group determines that no objective evidence of impairment exists for an individually assessed financialasset. whether significant or not. it includes the asset in a group of financial assets with similar credit risk characteristics andcollectively assesses them for impairment. Assets that are individually assessed for impairment and for which an impairmentloss is, or continues to be recognised, are not included in a collective assessment of impairment.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets carried at amortised cost has been incurred, the amountof the loss is measured as the difference between the assets carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cashflows discounted at the financial asset‘s original effective interest rate. If a loan has a variable interest rate, the discount ratefor measuring any impairment loss is the current effective interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced throughthe use of an allowance account. The impairment loss is recognised in profit or loss.
When the asset becomes uncollectible, the oam/ing amount of impaired financial asset is reduced directly or if an amountwas charged to the allowance account, the amounts charged to the allowance account are written off against the carryingvalue of the financial asset.
To determine whether there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on financial assets has been incurred, the Groupconsiders factors such as the probability of insolvency or significant financial difficulties of the debtor and default or significantdelay in payments.
If in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be related obiectively to an eventoccurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed to the extent that thecarrying amount of the asset does not exceed its amortised cost at the reversal date. The amount of reversal is recognisedin profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and on hand, demand deposits, and shortrterm, highly lqulid investmentsthat are readily convertible to known amount of cash and which are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. Thesealso include bank overdrafts that form an integral part of the Group‘s cash management.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it isprobable that an outflow of resources embodying economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the amountof the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Provisions are reviewed at the end of each reporting period and adjusted to reflect the current best estimate. If it is nolonger probable that an outflow of economic resources will be required to settle the obligation, the provision is reversed. Ifthe effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are discounted using a current pre tax rate that reflects, whereappropriate, the risks specific to the liability. When discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage oftime is recognised as a finance cost.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTV (CONTINUED)
4.1
Critical judgments in applying accounting policies
Significant judgments made by management that have a signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carryingamounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are:
Determinalian of asset versus business acquisitiun
At the time of acquiring Proiific Properties Sdn. End. and Proliﬁc Revenue Sdn. Bhd., the Group considers whether each ofthese acquisitions constitutes acquisition of business as defined under FRS 103 or acquisition of assets, The entities ownland parcels and have been hoiding the iand in a passive fashion with no operations or plans in place to use them, The Groupplans to use these land parceis for deveiopment purpose after the acquisitions. Based on these considerations, the Group hasconcluded that the transactions in substance constitute acquisition of assets and has accounted for them as such in thesefinancial statements.
classification 0! properties
In the process of classifying properties, management has made various judgments. Judgment is needed to determine whethera property quaiifies as an investment property, property, plant and equipment and/or development property held for sale, TheGroup deveiops criteria so that it can exercise that judgment consistently in accordance with the definitions of investmentproperty, property, plant and equipment and development property held for sale. In making its judgment, managementconsidered the detailed criteria and reiated guidance for the classification of properties as set out in FRS 2, FRS i6 and FRS40, and in particular, the intended usage of property as determined by the management
Contracts with customersSatisfaction of perfurmance obligations
The Group is required to assess each of its contracts with customers to determine whether pen‘ormance obligations aresatisfied over time or at a point in time in order to determine the appropriate method for recognising revenue. The Grouphas assessed that based on the contracts entered into with customers and the provisions of relevant iaws and regulations,the Group recognises revenue over time where contracts are entered into for property development (sale of properties tocustomers), the Group does not create an asset with an alternative use to the Group and has an enforceable right to paymentfor performance completed to date.
Where the above criteria are not met, revenue is recognised at a point in time. Where revenue is recognised at a point oftime, the Group assesses each contract with customers to determine when the performance obiigation of the Group underthe contract is satisfied.
Determination of transaction pricesThe Group is required to determine the transaction price in respect of each of its contracts with customers. In making such
judgment the Group assesses the impact of any variable consideration in the contract, due to discounts or penaities, theexistence of any significant financing component and any non-cash consideration in the contract.

CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGMENTS AND KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTV (CONTiNUED)
4.2
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources at estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period,that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabiiities within the nextfinancial year. are discussed below:
Allocation of transaction price.I in performance obligations in contracts with customers
The Group has eiected to apply the input method in allocating the transaction price to performance obligations where revenueis recognised over time, The Group considers that the use of the input method, which requires revenue recognition on thebasis of the Group‘s efforts to the satisfaction of performance obligation. provides the best reference of revenue actuallyearned. lh appiying the input method, the Group estimates the efforts or inputs to the satisfaction of a performance obligation,These estimates mainly include: (a) for development contracts, the cost of development and related infrastructure; and (b) forservices contracts, the time elapsed.
Estimation of net realisable value for development properties
Development properties are stated at lower of cost or net realisable value (NRV). NRV is assessed with reference to the estimatedselling prices and estimated totai construction costs. The estimated selling prices are based on recent selling prices for thedevelopment proiect or comparable projects and prevailing market conditions. The estimated total construction costs are basedon contracted amounts and, in respect of amounts not contracted for, management's estimates of the amounts to be incurredtaking into consideration historicai trends of the amounts incurred.
Impairment of trade and other receivables
An estimate of the coilectibie amount of trade and other receivables is made when collection of the full amount is no longerprobable, This determination of whether the receivables are impaired entails management‘s evaluation of the specific creditand liquidity position of the customers and related parties and their historical recovery rates, including discussion with thelegal department and review of the current economic environment. Management is satisfied that no additionai impairment isrequired on its trade and other receivables in excess of amount already provided for.
Taxes
Uncertainties exist with respect to the interpretation of complex tax regulations and the amount and timing of future taxableincome. The Group estabiishes provisions, based on reasonable estimates, for possible consequences of audits by the taxauthorities of the respective countries in which it operates. The amount of such provisions is based on various factors, suchas experience of previous tax audits and differing interpretations of tax regulations by the taxable entity and the relevant taxauthority. Such differences of interpretation may arise on a wide variety of issues depending on the conditions prevailing inthe respective Group's domiCile,
Deferred tax assets are recognised for ali unused tax losses to the extent that it is probable that taxable profitwili be avaiiabieagainst which the iosses can be utiiised, Significant management judgment is required to determine the amount of deferredtax assets that can be recognised, based upon the likely timing and level of future taxable profits together with future taxplanning strategies.

- Movie-Town Project: an integrated mixed development set on 8.86acres of land along he Melaka Straits
- Cyberjaya Project: an integrated mixed development in Selangor witha total GDV 0f RM3.0 billion
To accelerate our property developments, we made two announcementssubsequent to the end 0 FY2017, On 22 September 2017, we enteredinto a convertible loan agreement with Haitong International FinancialProducts (Singapore) Pte. Ltd. to raise up to US$20 million (S$27 million)to accelerate the development of Hatten City Phase 2 and to enhanceHatten City Phase 1. The conversion price of S$0.35 represents a 79.1 %premium to the last traded price before the announcement and reflectspositively on Hatten Lanc’s ability to enhance shareholder value.

OUTLOOKMelaka has a unique s rategic location and a unique historical legacydating back to the travels of Zheng He(“CI1eng Ho), the renowned MingDynasty admiral. This historical fact is of great signiﬁcance for Melaka inthe development of China‘s Belt and Road Initiative in Malaysia Our trackrecord and strong presence in the property market in Melaka, along withour listed status, position Hatten Land well to capture these opportunitiesin the state and within Malaysia.

Melaka is expected to benefit significantly not just from the Belt and RoadInitiative which will include land reclamation and port development, butalso from major infrastructure developments that have been announced orare being planned. These include the Kuala Lumpur-Singapore High SpeedRail — due for completion in 2026 — which will pass through Melaka andexpansion of the Melaka International Airport.
Without a doubt, Melaka and Malaysia will witness some of themost exciting infrastructure developments in South East Asia. Thesedevelopments will boost economic development and tourist arrivals whichwill in turn spur demand for real estate projects as well as wellnessrrelated services.
